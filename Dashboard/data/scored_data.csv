Wall Street wary of progressive Democrats on the House finance committee,Jan 20 2019,"WASHINGTON (AFP) - Wall Street is bunkering down for a wave of intense scrutiny as a group of progressive Democrats, including social media star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have joined a powerful House of Representatives committee overseeing banking activities. ""It's a huge victory,"" said Ms Ocasio-Cortez, who at 29 is   and a self-described socialist - a word that shocks conservatives, who brandish it as a dire threat. ""I cannot stress how important this moment is. Dems are putting members who rejected corporate campaign money on a committee overseeing Wall St.,"" she tweeted. Ms Ocasio-Cortez, often referred to by her initials AOC, will bring public attention to the ordinarily drab committee via her strong social media presence that includes 2.5 million followers on Twitter. Wall Street is trying to figure out the goals of the Democrats, now in charge of the House of Representatives after eight years of control by President Donald Trump's Republicans. While the Senate remains in Republican hands and ready to block dramatic changes, Democratic control of the House promises at least to make life difficult for bankers, with tighter industry oversight and lengthy public hearings. The symbolism is already striking. The panel is headed by Ms Maxine Waters, 80, a regular target of Mr Trump's barbs, who is the first woman and the first African American to head the committee. Ms Waters has warned the financial sector that the days of banking deregulation and lax oversight are over. In her first speech as committee chairwoman last Wednesday (Jan 16), Ms Waters said the 2008 financial crisis ""was a result of Wall Street running amok, with abusive institutions peddling toxic products... with no agency responsible for prioritising consumer protection"". ""Ultimately, the economy was sent tumbling into the abyss,"" she said. ""Our fear,"" a banking source told AFP, ""is that she (Waters) will reinforce oversight of big banks."" The source expects to see ""more CEO hearings in Congress"" with the Democrats in charge. Half of the new committee members belong to the Progressive Caucus, the left wing of the Democratic Party. Several made a splash when they ran for office in the November 2018 election. They include Ms Ayanna Pressley, the first African American congresswoman from Massachusetts, and Ms Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian American and one of the two first female Muslim lawmakers in Washington. The newcomers favour tighter banking oversight, but also promise to fight for easier access to credit, more industry diversity, and against housing discrimination. ""I'm looking forward to digging into the student loan crisis, examining for-profit prisons/ICE detention, and exploring the development of public & postal banking. To start,"" Ms Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. ""Public banking"" are two words that send shivers down the spine of Wall Street. Nevertheless, ""Cortez won't set the agenda of the committee, Chairwoman Walters will"", a second banking source said. ""We have a lot of differences with her (Waters) but she's been in that committee for 30 years. We know her, she knows us,"" the source said. ""There are bipartisan issues we can work on."" The alliance of progressive Democrats extends into the Senate, where they can count on support from Ms Elizabeth Warren, who has announced her interest in running for president in 2020. Even though she is confined to the opposition, the 69-year-old senator can make bankers and government officials squirm with tough questions from her perch on the Senate finance committee. ""With Republicans in control of the Senate, Waters' best hope for the next two years is to keep financial issues in the limelight in the hope they influence the election next year,"" wrote FTN analyst Chris Low.","{'neg': 0.058, 'neu': 0.863, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': 0.9415}",0.9415

The country  , the first for Goldman, and may discuss dropping those allegations if the bank pays the sum, Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng told reporters yesterday. Units of the bank were accused of making false statements in documents submitted to a local regulator in arranging US$6.5 billion bond offers for troubled state fund 1MDB. ""Goldman Sachs should understand the agony and the trauma suffered by the Malaysian people as a result of the 1MDB scandal,"" Mr Lim said in the administrative capital of Putrajaya. ""An apology is just not sufficient. Not enough. There must be the necessary reparations and compensation,"" he added. Goldman's chief executive David Solomon this week apologised to the Malaysian people for the role that senior banker  . The country was ""defrauded by many individuals"", with Leissner being ""one of those people"", Mr Solomon said during a conference call with analysts, after the investment bank reported its earnings on Wednesday. Leissner has pleaded guilty to charges including conspiring to launder money, while another former Goldman banker Roger Ng remains in custody in Malaysia as he faces extradition to the United States to face related allegations. Mr Solomon reiterated that the firm conducted considerable due diligence on the deals and was lied to by Leissner. Appearing on his first earnings call since becoming CEO in October, Mr Solomon said the firm is cooperating with the US Justice Department and the investigation is still open. Goldman has said it will vigorously defend itself against the charges by Malaysia. The allegations against Goldman were filed by Attorney-General Tommy Thomas as Malaysia's top prosecutor, while the Finance Minister is not formally authorised to make decisions on criminal charges. ""At least he accepted that they have to bear and shoulder some responsibility,"" Mr Lim said, referring to Mr Solomon. ""If not for the change of government, do you think Goldman Sachs would have apologised? We are talking about the largest investment bank in the world... It's not easy to get an apology from them,"" Mr Lim said. ""An apology with US$7.5 billion, that is what matters.""","{'neg': 0.082, 'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.052, 'compound': -0.9402}",-0.9402

It will bring together the finance industry, academia and science-based organisations to help Singapore-based financial institutions operating in the region to deepen their expertise in sustainable finance. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is the secretariat and knowledge partner. Other knowledge partners include the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change and the National University of Singapore. The Association of Banks in Singapore, the Life Insurance Association, Institute of Banking and Finance Singapore and the Singapore Exchange Regulation are among the finance sector partners. An ASFI spokesman said: ""The financial sector is crucial in creating resilient and sustainable economic growth through its ability to influence companies to adopt best practices and to direct financial flows towards sustainable development. ""As a key global financial hub, Singapore is an important conduit for capital flows into the Asia region, and as such its financial institutions have significant potential to shape resilient regional economies.""

By signing up, you agree to our   and  Sustainable finance is also key to addressing the region's increasing vulnerability to climate change, the degradation of land and ocean ecosystems, labour and human rights and water risk, she added. The initiative will focus on helping financial institutions better understand and incorporate environmental, social and governance risks and opportunities into decision making. It will assist partners in devising standards and certification schemes and help institutions understand material, environmental and social issues so they can price risk and value companies. The ASFI will also bring research and innovative tools so finance institutions can develop viable green solutions to create an actual impact on the environment and society. Ms Indranee Rajah, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Finance and Education, told the launch: ""Financial institutions play an important role in influencing how capital is allocated to economic activities with sustainable development outcomes. "" This will facilitate decision-making ... that delivers financial performance as well as positive impacts on society."" She added that as a financial centre, institutions here have significant potential to catalyse sustainable finance in the region. ""While we are still at the early stages ... we have seen some success in encouraging the use of debt capital market financing towards sustainable projects."" In 2017, developer City Developments Limited issued the first green bond in Singapore and DBS Bank partnered Impact Investment Exchange to list the world's first listed social bond, an US$8 million Women's Livelihood Bond. ""Over the years, we have also built a strong ecosystem of investment managers who possess significant expertise in investing into Asia, many of whom are actively exploring the integration of ESG considerations with Asian investment strategies,"" Ms Indranee added. She said that Singapore can advance deeper ESG integration within financial institutions and implement credible standards. There should also be deepened research and development in ESG products by building capabilities. The Ministry of Environmental and Water Resources and the Monetary Authority Singapore welcomed the initiative: ""Partnerships and collective action are essential to achieving sustainable development."" Ms Jeanne Stampe, the head of WWF's Asia Sustainable Finance team and founder of ASFI, said: ""Today's pressing environmental and social challenges threaten the ... stability of Asian economies.","{'neg': 0.029, 'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.9944}",0.9944

Philippines' richest person Henry Sy dies at 94,Jan 20 2019,"MANILA • Mr Henry Sy, who became a billionaire by parlaying a shoe store into the biggest retailer in the Philippines, has died. He was 94. He died in his sleep yesterday morning, his daughter, Ms Teresita Sy-Coson, and Mr Jose Sio, chairman of SM Investments, said. Mr Sy had a net worth of US$7.2 billion (S$9.8 billion), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, making him the richest person in the Philippines. His company started as a shoe store in 1948. Today, SM Investments is an empire that includes SM Retail, which operates the nation's biggest supermarket and department-store chains; SM Prime Holdings, the largest shopping-mall operator; and BDO Unibank. In the nation of more than 105 million people, his malls attract an average of 3.5 million shoppers a day. ""It's not overboard to consider Sy as the father of Philippine retail,"" said Mr Astro del Castillo, managing director at First Grade Finance Inc. ""His grocery, department stores and malls introduced the one-stop-shop concept in the country, and his malls changed not only the practice of retail but the way of life."" Mr Sy amassed his fortune against the backdrop of unstable governments, political corruption and economic contractions, notably the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998. He continued to expand his empire with new shopping malls and a bank that eventually became the nation's largest by assets. Today, the group runs 62 department stores, 56 supermarkets, a network of 194 SaveMore grocery stores and 50 hypermarkets. Mr Sy was born in Xiamen, in China's Fujian province. He emigrated to the Philippines at the age of 12 and started selling rice, sardines and soap at his father's neighbourhood store in Manila in 1936. The store was burned and looted during World War II. Following the war, he set up a footwear store, and later founded ShoeMart, the nation's largest chain and the first air-conditioned shop to sell shoes in the Philippines, in 1958. In 1972, Mr Sy opened his first department store two months after then President Ferdinand Marcos placed the country under martial law. Mr Sy opened his first mall in 1985, when the economy was in its worst post-war slump. ""Every time the country is in a crisis, I think and decide where is the best way to go,"" Mr Sy said in a July 2009 interview. ""We have to always think of ways to overcome these limitations.""","{'neg': 0.084, 'neu': 0.878, 'pos': 0.038, 'compound': -0.9758}",-0.9758

In response to ST's queries, PUB said it received a report of discharge in an outlet drain at Potong Pasir Avenue 1 at 10.20am on Saturday. ""PUB officers and contractors went down to investigate immediately,"" the national water agency said on Sunday, adding that the investigation was in progress. There was no discharge found at the site when the officers arrived, as it might have been diluted with water in the canal, PUB said. Samples were taken from the water in the canal, it said. ""Online water quality sensors and in-situ water quality readings showed that water quality is within the normal range. We will continue to closely monitor water quality over the next few days,"" a PUB spokesman said. The National Environment Agency said it was aware of the matter and is investigating.

Mr Ng told ST that he was concerned that birds, fish and otters in the area would be affected. His friend later alerted the authorities, he said.

It was part of an initiative called Project Refresh, which aims to encourage people of all ages to volunteer. The initiative was started by Young NTUC, the youth wing of the National Trades Union Congress, in 2016. Since then, it has been held about four times a year, before major festivals such as Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Aidilfitri, Deepavali and Christmas. Yesterday's event - a joint effort by Young NTUC and North East Community Development Council - had the highest number of volunteers since the programme started. Taking part were students and teachers, employees from corporate organisations, grassroots volunteers, as well as Tampines residents. Project Refresh has previously been held in North East District in areas such as Punggol and Hougang. Tampines resident Wong Cher Khoon, 65, who lives with his wife, said he appreciated the effort by the volunteers to give the walls in his two-room flat a fresh coat of paint.

Wall Street braces itself for tighter oversight of banks,Jan 21 2019,"WASHINGTON • Wall Street is bracing itself for a wave of intense scrutiny as a group of progressive Democrats, including social media star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, joined a powerful House of Representatives committee overseeing banking activities. ""It's a huge victory,"" said Ms Ocasio-Cortez,   and a self-described socialist - a word that shocks conservatives, who brandish it as a dire threat. ""I cannot stress how important this moment is. Dems are putting members who rejected corporate campaign money on a committee overseeing Wall St,"" she tweeted. Ms Ocasio-Cortez, often referred to by her initials AOC, will bring public attention to the ordinarily drab committee via her strong social media presence that includes 2.5 million followers on Twitter. Wall Street is trying to figure out the goals of the Democrats, now in charge of the House of Representatives which had, for the past eight years, been under the control of the Republicans. While the Senate remains in Republican hands and ready to block dramatic changes, Democratic control of the House promises at least to make life difficult for bankers, with tighter industry oversight and lengthy public hearings. The symbolism is already striking. The committee is headed by Mrs Maxine Waters, 80, a regular target of President Donald Trump's barbs and the first woman and first African-American to head the panel. Mrs Waters has warned the financial sector that the days of banking deregulation and lax oversight are over. In her first speech as committee chairman last Wednesday, she said the 2008 financial crisis ""was a result of Wall Street running amok, with abusive institutions peddling toxic products... with no agency responsible for prioritising consumer protection. Ultimately, the economy was sent tumbling into the abyss"". ""Our fear,"" a banking source told Agence France-Presse, ""is that she (Mrs Waters) will reinforce oversight of big banks."" The source expects to see ""more CEO hearings in Congress"" with the Democrats in charge. Half of the new committee members belong to the Progressive Caucus, the left wing of the Democratic Party. Several made a splash when they ran for office in last November's election. They include Ms Ayanna Pressley, the first African-American congresswoman from Massachusetts, and Ms Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian-American and one of the two first female Muslim lawmakers in Washington. The newcomers favour tighter banking oversight, but also promise to fight for easier access to credit, more industry diversity, and against housing discrimination. ""I'm looking forward to digging into the student loan crisis, examining for-profit prisons/ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) detention, and exploring the development of public & postal banking. To start,"" Ms Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. ""Public banking"" are two words that send shivers down the spine of Wall Street. Nevertheless, ""Cortez won't set the agenda of the committee; Chairwoman Waters will"", a second banking source said. ""We have a lot of differences with her (Waters) but she's been in that committee for 30 years. We know her, she knows us,"" the source said. ""There are bipartisan issues we can work on."" The alliance of progressive Democrats extends into the Senate, where they can count on support from Ms Elizabeth Warren, who has announced her interest in running for president in 2020. Even though she is confined to the opposition, the 69-year-old senator can make bankers and government officials squirm with tough questions from her perch on the Senate finance committee. ""With Republicans in control of the Senate, Waters' best hope for the next two years is to keep financial issues in the limelight in the hope they influence the election next year,"" wrote FTN analyst Chris Low. Having Ms Ocasio-Cortez on the committee ""will bolster that goal"", he said.","{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.864, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': 0.9415}",0.9415
"Black discharge spotted in Potong Pasir canal, PUB investigating",Jan 21 2019,"The authorities are investigating a black discharge seen in a canal in Potong Pasir.Tee Zhuo Videos uploaded on the Nature Society (Singapore) Facebook page last Saturday morning, and shared with The Straits Times, show an inky black substance flowing into the canal, which then spreads and clouds the water rapidly. In response to ST's queries, national water agency PUB said it received a report of discharge in an outlet drain at Potong Pasir Avenue 1 at 10.20am on Saturday. ""PUB officers and contractors went down to investigate immediately,"" the national water agency said yesterday, adding that investigation was in progress. There was no discharge found at the site when the officers arrived as it might have been diluted with water in the canal, PUB said. ""Online water quality sensors and in-situ water quality readings showed that water quality is within the normal range. We will continue to closely monitor water quality over the next few days,"" a PUB spokesman said. The National Environment Agency (NEA) said it was aware of the matter and is investigating. In the videos, a construction site and a Lian Beng Group crane can be seen adjacent to the canal. ST understands that a condominium is being built at the site, and that the canal leads to the Kallang River. Mr Ted Ng, 34, who frequents the area to photograph wildlife, said he spotted the black liquid flowing into the canal twice, first at around 9.30am, and the second time between 10.30am and 11am. Several residents nearby had also whipped out their phones to take pictures and videos, added Mr Ng, an administrator who works in the finance industry. He said he was concerned that birds, fish and otters in the area would be affected. His friend later alerted the authorities, he said. Veteran wildlife expert Subaraj Rajathurai said the presence of a black discharge could mean oil or inner soil from the site.","{'neg': 0.012, 'neu': 0.958, 'pos': 0.03, 'compound': 0.6908}",0.6908

No more cheat sheets for Indonesia presidential candidates Jokowi and Prabowo at election debates,Jan 21 2019,"JAKARTA (THE JAKARTA POST/ ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Indonesia's General Elections Commission (KPU) has decided not to provide the presidential candidates with a list of question before the next election debates, after public criticism of the  , which took place last Thursday (Jan 17). KPU commissioner Pramono Ubaid Tanthowi said the decision was made after an evaluation of the first debate. ""We will inform the teams of the two candidates in a meeting on Monday,"" Mr Pramono said on Sunday (Jan 20). He said the KPU took public opinion, especially from civil society groups, into account when it made its decision. The decision was made during a meeting to evaluate the first debate and to make improvements in the following debates, which will be held once a month until the election on April 17. A political observer from the Indonesian Public Institute (IPI), Mr Jerry Massie, urged the KPU not to give any more ""cheat sheets"" to ensure a better quality debate. ""The first debate appeared uninteresting and of a poor quality. Anyone can debate (if they receive the questions beforehand),"" Mr Jerry said as quoted by Antara. Last Thursday, candidates President Joko Widodo - who is seeking a second term - and Mr Prabowo Subianto, as well as their respective running mates Ma'ruf Amin and Sandiaga Uno, faced off in their first debate at the Bidakara Hotel in South Jakarta. Despite the cheat sheet, the candidates traded barbs and sometimes got quite heated in the debate moderated by news presenters Ira Koesno and Imam Priyono. The concerns of a potentially uninteresting debate had been expressed by several experts prior to the debate, but in its defence, the KPU said that the hints were provided to allow candidates to present ideas clearly and comprehensively. KPU commissioner Pramono said previously in a statement that the debate should be more about presenting ideas than political theatre. ""Election debates are not quizzes or a reality show filled with guessing games. That is not the substance. What voters need are their ideas, visions and missions, not entertainment."" The KPU handed five questions to both presidential candidate pairs several days before the first debate. The questions were formulated by National Commission on Human Rights chairman Ahmad Taufik Damanik, former Supreme Court chief justice Bagir Manan, international law expert Hikmahanto Juwana, law expert Bivitri Susanti, legal analyst Margarito Kamis and Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) chairman Agus Rahardjo. In addition to the prepared questions, the candidate pairs were also given the opportunity to ask questions of their rivals. The questions were confidential, but should not go beyond the set topics. Vice-presidential candidate Sandiaga said he supported the KPU's decision to liven up the debate. ""Each candidate pair will convey what's on their minds and in their hearts openly and comprehensively without having to be limited by the question list,"" he was quoted as telling the Antara news agency on the sidelines of his campaign activity in Surabaya, East Java, last Saturday. The second debate is slated for Feb 17 and will have energy, food, natural resources, environment and infrastructure as the topics. Only Mr Joko and Mr Prabowo will face off in the second debate. The third one will be on March 17 and only the running mates will participate, to debate education, health, manpower and social and cultural topics.","{'neg': 0.019, 'neu': 0.904, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': 0.9839}",0.9839
Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou's comfy house arrest masks darker reality,Jan 19 2019,"VANCOUVER •   steps out of her US$4.2 million (S$5.7 million) mansion, with a Global Positioning System (GPS) monitor strapped to her ankle, and slips into a chauffeured black sport utility vehicle. Then she is off, largely free to roam the shops and restaurants within 260 sq km of Vancouver until her 11pm curfew. So goes another day of house arrest for Meng, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies and daughter of the billionaire founder of China's biggest telecommunications manufacturer. It is, by all appearances, a comfortable life for someone at the centre of a complex power game. Meng's arrest at the behest of the United States - which wants her extradited on grounds that she tricked banks into   - has sparked an unprecedented diplomatic row. Nine days after her  , China  . And this week, a China court imposed a death sentence, following a one-day trial,  . How Meng's case will be resolved remains unclear, though she has become an object of fascination in a city where her family owns two homes and where she spent downtime when she was not running Huawei's finances. Tourists stop by to take selfies outside her home, which is near a 810ha park overlooking the Pacific Ocean, where she is ensconced with her husband and daughter.  include the GPS monitor, an 11pm to 6am curfew, and 24-hour surveillance by a private security firm, Lions Gate Risk Management Group. The firm's job is to ensure that she does not violate the conditions of her release. She pays the hefty bill for that monitoring, which includes two guards at a time and a driver. ""If I were on The Price Is Right, I'd say that's about US$7,000 a day"", or more than US$2.5 million a year, said former police detective Nicholas Casale, referencing the game show. Meng's long leash following her C$10 million (S$10.2 million) bail is unusual, he said - normally, the defendant's movements and communications would be restricted. ""You can't just go to dinner or go shopping,"" he added. Meng is faring better than the two Canadians detained in China, who have had scant consular access. Still, the outings and postcard views mask a darker reality for Meng: This extradition process could drag on for months, and possibly years, if history is any guide. And the odds are high that she will be extradited in the end. ""The tilt of the Crown in these cases is extradite, extradite, extradite,"" said Professor Robert Currie at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who specialises in international law. The US must turn over its formal extradition request by the end of this month. It has not made the request yet, a Justice Department spokesman said in an e-mail on Thursday. Canada's Justice Minister David Lametti can reject the request or order extradition hearings to begin. It is not clear if that will happen before Meng's next court date next month.","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.873, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': 0.7135}",0.7135
Economic gloom looms over annual Davos meet,Jan 19 2019,"MILAN • An array of crises will keep several world leaders away from the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos next week, which takes place against a backdrop of deepening gloom over the global economic and political outlook. Anxieties over trade disputes, fractious international relations, Brexit and a growth slowdown that some fear could tip the world economy into recession are set to dominate the Jan 22 to 25 Alpine meeting. The WEF's own Global Risks Report set the tone this week with a stark warning of looming economic headwinds, in part because of geopolitical tensions among major powers. Some 3,000 business, government and civil society figures are due to gather in the snow-blanketed ski resort, but among them are only three leaders of the Group of Seven (G-7) most industrialised countries: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. Mr Donald Trump, who stole the Davos limelight last year with a rare appearance by a sitting US president, pulled out of this year's event as he grapples with a partial US government shutdown. The White House said on Thursday that Mr Trump had also  . Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been expected to lead the US team, according to two senior administration officials. French President Emmanuel Macron is also skipping the meeting as he seeks to respond to the ""yellow vest"" protests, while  . CALMING INVESTORS DR NARIMAN BEHRAVESH, chief economist at IHS Markit, on what to expect at the WEF next week. Outside the G-7, the leaders of Russia and India are shunning Davos. China's President Xi Jinping - who was the first Chinese leader to attend the elite gathering in 2017 to offer a vigorous defence of free trade - is sending his deputy instead. That will leave the likes of British Finance Minister Philip Hammond, Chinese Vice-President Wang Qishan and a host of central bankers with the task of trying to reassure business chiefs. ""Davos will be dominated by a high level of anxiety about stock markets, a slowdown in growth and international politics,"" said Dr Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit. ""The leadership presence is lower than last year, but those who are going... will be seeking to impart a sense of confidence and calm business and investors' nerves."" Before the US cancellation, a Trump administration official had said the US delegation would also discuss the importance of reforming institutions such as the World Trade Organisation, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Davos watchers said the absence of so many top leaders this year did not mean the glitzy forum had lost its status as a global stage for top politicians to present their agendas. ""Abe is going to Davos not just as Japanese prime minister, but also as chair of the Group of 20 (G-20). It will be a perfect opportunity to lay the groundwork for upcoming G-20 meetings,"" said a Japanese government source. ""Of course there may be inconveniences such as missing opportunities to hold bilateral meetings, but that won't undermine the importance of Davos,"" he added. Davos will be the first major international outing for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, elected on a wave of anti-establishment and conservative nationalism also seen elsewhere. He said on Twitter he would present ""a different Brazil, free of ideological ties and widespread corruption"".","{'neg': 0.047, 'neu': 0.849, 'pos': 0.103, 'compound': 0.9921}",0.9921
Shadow boxing with power elites from the past,Jan 19 2019,"There has been a storm of opinions in the mobile chat groups of Umno members regarding news that the six MPs who quit the party will be allowed back in. The opinions range from outright disgust and opposition to a more forgiving acceptance of the six, whose rebellion last month was the catalyst to the Umno president Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi taking leave of absence. News claiming that the six MPs would be rejoining Umno was met with harsh remarks such as sampah, or garbage, and traitors in those chat groups. Those who oppose their readmission declared that there would be no forgiveness for their betrayal, with one commentator saying that ""the general who runs away from the battlefield deserves to face the firing squad"". However, Kelantan opposition chief Alwi Che Ahmad took a different stand and is advocating a second chance for the rebels. Mr Alwi said: ""I know that our members are still very angry with them. What they did was wrong but if people want to come back, we should accept because it is not easy to get six parliamentary seats. ""Their aim was not to join Bersatu. They are out to stop Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim from becoming prime minister and they wanted Zahid to step down."" But he said the group cannot come back to their previous party posts in the divisions or supreme council, and will have to start as ordinary members. The avalanche of opinions has not stopped even though Datuk Seri Ikmal Hisham Abdul Aziz, one of the six, has denied outright that he is rejoining Umno. Sources close to the six said none of them have applied to return to Umno. As of now, they remain as independent MPs. But it is understood that something is brewing behind the scenes to help pave their way back to Umno. Well-placed sources claim that Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein could be playing a key role in reconnecting the group with Umno. Mr Alwi said the Umno grassroots had not followed the leaders who left the party. ""It shows that nowadays, people do not respect those who jump from one side to the other,"" he said. There's a virtual chess match going on between two opposing camps in the Philippine government. This is the feeling one gets when reading the verbal skirmishes between the two warring factions of the ruling administration. One camp is led by President Rodrigo Duterte, while the other is headed by former president and current Speaker Gloria Arroyo. The Arroyo knights include House Majority Leader Rolando Andaya Jr and Minority Leader Danilo Suarez, while their pawns include the members of the House committee on rules who conducted a hearing in Naga City to skewer and fry targeted officials of the Duterte camp. The Duterte rooks and bishops include Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno and Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez, and their pawns include the other Cabinet secretaries and allied senators who have expressed support for the embattled members of the Duterte faction. The clashes are happening largely among the minions of Mr Duterte and Ms Arroyo. The hostilities began when Ms Arroyo, Mr Andaya and their favoured allies were accused of huge budget insertions amounting to billions of pesos that they allegedly allotted for their congressional districts. In particular, Ms Arroyo was accused of favouring her district with 2.4 billion pesos (S$61.9 million) in pork barrel funds, while Mr Andaya's district was lavished with 1.9 billion pesos. There were no convincing denials made by the Arroyo camp. Instead, they countered with their own charges of anomalies against the Duterte camp. In particular, Mr Andaya, has fired a barrage of charges against Mr Diokno, accusing the him of masterminding the insertion of 75 billion pesos in the 2019 budget for public infrastructure. Mr Duterte and Ms Arroyo have started to join the fracas. Ms Arroyo has called on the Duterte administration to produce ""tangible results"" this year to ease poverty. Mr Duterte countered that his administration has ""achieved more"" compared with the combined terms of Ms Arroyo and Mr Benigno Aquino. The whole sordid spectacle appears as a war between pots and kettles. It is during lucid intervals like this that the politicians are being honest about one another. Bring out the beer and let's enjoy watching this truth-telling episode among the leaders. Even before former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra entered politics, his family was involved in dubious, if not totally illegal, business documentation. In fact, it was something in his pre-Thai Rak Thai past, the massive transfers of shares from his inner circles to people who were not supposed to have them, that kick-started Thailand's ongoing and detrimental national divide. The trend of the Shinawatras using suspicious documents has continued. His younger sister Yingluck Shinawatra's current passport controversy reflects what must have become the clan's expertise in using ""borderline"" documents to do big things. However, whether it's really ""borderline"" is open to debate in the latest case, because if the words of a senior Cambodian government official are to be believed, the former Thai prime minister may have used a fake Cambodian passport to complete an important business registration. Even if the passport was genuine, legal trouble could still plague her mega-money business dealings. The Cambodian immigration official was spot on in saying that everyone knows she is a Thai, which means that accepting her ""Cambodian passport"" is tantamount to accepting her ""political persecution"" claims. That's a big deal, with potentially great legal, diplomatic and business repercussions. Thailand's upcoming election will have great significance in the international context. If one side triumphs, the Shinawatras can be travelling with ""better"" documents. If the other side wins, restrictions could increase and diplomatic headaches could multiply. Whoever wins, chances are things will continue to be complicated.","{'neg': 0.082, 'neu': 0.808, 'pos': 0.11, 'compound': 0.9872}",0.9872
US special counsel Robert Mueller disputes report Trump told lawyer to lie in Russian probe,Jan 19 2019,"WASHINGTON () - Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office on Friday (Jan 18) disputed a report in BuzzFeed News that President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen said . BuzzFeed, citing two unnamed law enforcement sources, said Cohen, who is , told investigators working for Mueller that Trump had directed him to lie about efforts to build a skyscraper in Moscow while he was running for president. ""BuzzFeed's description of specific statements to the Special Counsel's Office, and characterisation of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's Congressional testimony are not accurate,"" Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller's office, said in a rare statement from the special counsel. While Mueller's spokesman stopped short of declaring the article false in its entirety, he disputed portions of the story that appear to go to the heart of the allegations made against Trump. It was the first time Mueller has commented about a news article concerning his probe of Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election. BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith said in a statement: ""We stand by the reporting and the sources who informed it, and we urge the Special Counsel to make clear what he's disputing."" After the BuzzFeed report was published on Thursday night, investigators in the US Senate and House of Representatives said they plan to examine the allegations in the report. Leading Democrats in the House said they would seek to verify the story, saying that if true it would be evidence of criminal activity by the president. Earlier on Friday, the White House said the story was false.""Look, that's absolutely ridiculous,"" spokesman Sarah Sanders told reporters. David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor, said it was""exceedingly rare"" for Mueller to comment on a news report, highlighting the significance of the allegations made in the BuzzFeed article and the attention it was getting in the media and among lawmakers. ""They are making a public comment to tell everyone to calm down,"" Weinstein said. ""He doesn't want people to think his silence is confirming the truthfulness of the report."" BuzzFeed said Mueller's office learned of Trump's instructions to Cohen through internal Trump Organisation e-mails, witness interviews, text messages and other documents, and that Cohen told prosecutors about the directive in an interview. Trump said on Twitter that Cohen was lying in order to get less prison time. Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said in a statement that any suggestion that Trump told Cohen to lie is""categorically false"". Representatives for the Trump Organisation did not respond to a request for comment on the BuzzFeed report. Cohen, who once said he was so loyal to Trump that he would ""take a bullet"" for him, is scheduled to begin a three-year prison sentence in March after pleading guilty to charges including campaign finance violations, tax evasion and lying to Congress. If Trump did tell Cohen to lie, that would constitute criminal activity, said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat, who said he would look into the matter. ""Directing a subordinate to lie to Congress is a federal crime,"" Nadler said on Twitter. House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff said the allegation that Trump may have directed Cohen to lie under oath ""is among the most serious to date"". ""We will do what's necessary to find out if it's true,"" Schiff, also a Democrat, said on Twitter. Some Senate Intelligence Committee investigators hope to ask Cohen about the BuzzFeed report when he testifies behind closed doors in February, a committee source told . He also will face questions about it in testimony before the House Oversight Committee on Feb. 7. Legal experts say the allegation exposed Trump to a new level of risk in an investigation that has already resulted in convictions of or guilty pleas from four former campaign aides, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. ""It's a seismic event,"" Andy Wright, an associate White House counsel under former Democratic president Barack Obama, told . Cohen, his left arm in a sling, did not comment as he entered his apartment building in New York on Friday. His adviser, Lanny Davis, also declined to comment to , and his lawyer, Guy Petrillo, did not respond to a request for comment. Trump denounced Cohen as a ""rat"" after he began cooperating with investigators while Cohen, whose duties included making payoffs to two women who said they had affairs with Trump, said on Thursday he regretted giving ""my blind loyalty to a man who doesn't deserve it"". Directing or encouraging someone to lie under oath is a crime known as subornation of perjury. The report also raises questions about obstruction of justice and conspiracy. William Barr, Trump's nominee to be attorney-general, said at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday that a president would be committing obstruction if he directed a subordinate to lie under oath. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. While the Justice Department has previously concluded that a sitting president cannot be charged while in office, such an allegation, if found true, could fuel impeachment proceedings in Congress. Trump repeatedly has denied collusion with Russia and slammed   Russia also has rejected US intelligence findings that Moscow interfered in US politics in the 2016 election in an effort to boost Trump. Trump said during the presidential campaign that he had no ties or business dealings with Russia. Democrats, who took over the US House of Representatives this month, have generally been cautious regarding any talk of impeachment to remove Trump from office although some rank-and-file members have pushed for such a resolution. Impeachment proceedings would face an uphill battle in the Senate, where Trump's fellow Republicans have a majority. BuzzFeed also reported that Cohen regularly updated Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Ivanka Trump, who is now a top White House adviser, about the Moscow project.","{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.858, 'pos': 0.072, 'compound': 0.2392}",0.2392
EU states warned not to delay no-deal Brexit plans for finance,Jan 21 2019,"BRUSSELS (BLOOMBERG) Faced with political chaos in London, the European Union (EU) is stepping up its efforts to avoid a rupture in financial markets if the United Kingdom (UK) leaves  in little more than two months.

When it adopted its decision to allow 12 months of access to London Stock Exchange plc's LCH Ltd and other clearinghouses last month, it also called on member states ""to accelerate their work to prepare for all scenarios"" for the UK's departure. Germany and France are among countries that have taken national steps to make sure that financial contracts concluded with firms in the UK can be serviced even if the UK leaves without a deal on March 29. London's financial industry is meanwhile shifting operations to the rest of the EU to make sure it can continue to do business with clients there. Dombrovskis said the EU is now planning to work closer together on initiatives that can't be taken by officials in Brussels alone. ""We are setting up a common platform with member states to coordinate and exchange information about national measures,"" he said.

India presses for Pakistan to stay on terrorism financing list,Feb 21 2019,"NEW DELHI () - India is pressing for Pakistan to be kept on a terrorism financing watchlist following   that was claimed by a Pakistan-based militant group, three Indian government officials said on Thursday (Feb 21). The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global body created to counter-terrorism financing and money laundering, has been meeting in Paris this week and Pakistan has been hoping to get off a ""grey list"" of nations with inadequate controls over such activities. But two Indian government officials dealing with the issue said new information had been provided to the FATF relating to Pakistan after the   in the Pulwama district of Kashmir in which 40 paramilitary police were killed. The Jaish-e-Mohammad claimed responsibility for the attack. A third Indian official said details relating to the militant group's operations were provided to the FATF. ""It was a post-Pulwama brief,"" said one of the officials when asked about the information provided to the watchdog. The officials declined to be named as the talks were still underway in Paris. Pakistan has been on the grey list since June, making it harder for it to access international markets at a time when its economy is stumbling. While there are no direct legal implications from being on the list, it brings extra scrutiny from regulators and financial institutions that can chill trade and investment and increase transaction costs, experts say. Pakistan's Finance Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The attack chilled long  , with India accusing Pakistan of failing to crack down on militant groups operating from its soil, and saying it would work to isolate Islamabad diplomatically. It has cancelled Most Favoured Nation trade privileges for Pakistan and imposed 200 per cent duty on goods coming from Pakistan, further squeezing the barely US$2 billion (S$2.71 billion) bilateral trade. Pakistan has demanded India provide evidence for its claims that it supports militant groups and warned of retaliation if India attacks. The FATF said it would release the results of its review after a meeting of the group's decision-making body. ""We will publish the outcomes from the meeting, including our updated statements identifying high-risk and other monitored jurisdictions, at the end of the meeting, on Friday afternoon,"" Ms Alexandra Wijmenga-Daniel, FATF communications management adviser, said in an e-mail. Over 800 officials from global multilateral bodies including the IMF and World Bank are in Paris for the six-day FATF gathering. The Indian Finance Ministry did not reply to a  e-mail seeking comments. But an official said India's case was that Pakistan had done very little to close down the financing streams of militant groups, despite making assurances to the watchdog.","{'neg': 0.085, 'neu': 0.874, 'pos': 0.041, 'compound': -0.964}",-0.964
SHS Holdings warns of possible default on Bangladesh solar plant project on financing woes,Feb 20 2019,"SINGAPORE - Construction firm SHS Holdings' delayed solar power project in Bangladesh could face default and a termination of key agreements if required financing is not obtained on time, the company said on Wednesday (Feb 20) before the market opened. If a default is triggered under the agreement with the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), the group will only be able to recover between US$3 million to US$8 million of the US$21.7 million already invested into the solar project, SHS said. SHS's HDFC SinPower unit is building a 50-megawatt solar plant under agreements with the BPDB and the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources. But SHS said construction is now facing further delays due to a lack of financing after the deadline had already been pushed back by more than a year from the initially scheduled April 2018 to October 2019 currently. SHS said funding of up to 70 per cent of the total cost of the solar project - translating to up to US$56 million - was meant to come from financial institutions. Its unit HDFC is now exploring ""alternative financing"", and is in talks with various parties to secure such financing for the construction of the solar power plant. It will then pursue another extension from the current deadline of Oct 31, 2019. Under current terms, the construction of the solar power plant needs to start by February 2019 to meet the October deadline. SHS had earlier cited reasons such as land issues, regulatory approvals, and weather conditions, as reasons for the delays, on top of financing woes.","{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.912, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': 0.8074}",0.8074
UK lawmakers could vote on revised Brexit deal next week: Finance minister Philip Hammond,Feb 21 2019,"LONDON () - British lawmakers could be given a vote on a revised Brexit deal as soon as next week as negotiators in Brussels scramble to clinch last-minute changes to the divorce accord that would avoid a potentially disorderly exit from the European Union. Unless Prime Minister Theresa May can get a Brexit deal approved by the British Parliament, she will have to decide whether to delay Brexit or thrust the world's fifth-largest economy into chaos by leaving without a deal on March 29. When asked what would happen next week, Finance Minister Philip Hammond said: ""There may be an opportunity to bring a vote back to the House of Commons - there may be an opportunity, but that will depend on the progress that is made in the next few days."" Mrs May, once a reluctant supporter of EU membership who won the top job in the political chaos following the 2016 referendum, has promised to give lawmakers a chance to decide what to do about Brexit on Feb 27 unless she can bring back a deal. She pressed for ""legally binding changes"" at talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday. Mrs May wants to prevent the ""backstop"" policy on the Irish border binding Britain indefinitely to EU rules. Lawmakers on Jan 15  , the worst defeat in modern British parliamentary history, largely due to the Irish backstop, which is intended to avoid new trouble in Northern Ireland. With the clock ticking down to March 29, the date  , the United Kingdom is ensnared in its deepest political crisis in half a century as it grapples with how, or even whether, to exit the European project that it joined in 1973. Mr Hammond said Mrs May's talks with Mr Juncker had gone well. ""They were good and constructive talks yesterday,"" Mr Hammond said, adding that the two sides were talking about giving some guarantees that the Irish border backstop could only be a""temporary arrangement"". ""That is a word that hasn't been used before and I think that is significant,"" he said. ""Both sides have acknowledged that the political declaration could be expanded, for example, to address concerns that have been expressed in some parts of the House of Commons about workers' rights."" People close to the negotiations say discussions have been focusing on what Mrs May and Mr Juncker in a joint statement called""appropriate legal assurance to both sides"". Brexit Minister Steve Barclay will be back in Brussels on Thursday, along with the Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox. Ever since Britain   in a referendum in June 2016, the political class has been debating how to leave the European project forged by France and Germany after the devastation of World War Two. While the country is divided over EU membership, most agree it is at a crossroads and that its choices over Brexit will shape the prosperity of future generations. Investors and many company chiefs are worried leaving without a deal will shatter Britain's reputation as a stable destination for investment and slowly weaken London's position as a global capital. Some senior British ministers have warned Mrs May she must agree to delay Brexit if there is no divorce deal or face a rebellion in Parliament next week, the Sun newspaper reported.","{'neg': 0.103, 'neu': 0.803, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': -0.8648}",-0.8648
Kuala Lumpur mulls over new ECRL proposals in bid to find middle ground with China,Feb 21 2019,"KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia is exploring new options to push down the cost of the China-backed East Coast Rail Line (ECRL), after an impasse over pricing nearly torpedoed the 688-km line spanning the width of the peninsula last month.Shannon Teoh The Straits Times understands that a new alignment was among solutions mooted soon after the Pakatan Harapan (PH) administration walked back on plans to cancel the contract with China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) signed under the ousted Barisan Nasional regime.Trinna Leong ""It all needs to be recalculated. They are relooking the whole thing all over again,"" a source familiar with the negotiations said. Both Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng and Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah expressed optimism this week that a deal can be done before Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad attends Beijing's Belt And Road Forum in April. But former finance minister Daim Zainuddin, a close confidante of Tun Mahathir who is leading negotiations on the ECRL, told Nanyang Siang Pau in an interview published on Thursday (Feb 21) that Chinese negotiators are only due to visit this month and a final decision is ""not easy due to this issue being quite complicated"". Official sources told The Straits Times that the government wants to bring the price tag close to early estimates under the Najib Razak government. These ranged from RM27 billion to RM35 billion, compared to the RM66 billion that was finally agreed. The PH administration claims that after including financing and land costs, the bill would balloon to RM81 billion, a figure it cannot afford having inherited over RM1 trillion in liabilities from its predecessor. But the Chinese company, in negotiations with the Malaysian government last year, did not reduce its offer to below RM40 billion, said several sources. The ECRL is a key project in China's Belt and Road Initiative. It was supposed to link Port Klang in the west to Kuantan Port in the east, before continuing north to the Thai border. This would create a land bridge bypassing Singapore in one of the world's most important trade routes that connects Asian markets facing the Pacific and those that use the Indian Ocean, including Europe and Africa. Although certain cost-saving measures are amenable to both sides - including reducing the scale of the project size and removing some stops - a sticking point is Selangor's insistence that the rail not cut through the Klang Gates Quartz Ridge. Under the current plan, the portion connecting Port Klang and Gombak will pass through the 16-km quartz ridge, which is the world's longest and the state wants it gazetted as a Unesco heritage site. Realigning the rail around this feature could add billions to the cost depending on the path selected, but it is unclear if Selangor will be persuaded to change its mind. ""Our stance on Klang Gates has not changed, and as of January no one has approached us to reconsider,"" a top official from the western state said on condition of anonymity. Another change bandied about is to end the line at Kuantan in Pahang state so that the ECRL meets the main objective of linking the two ports in east and west coasts of the peninsula, instead of the earlier version that extends the rail to Kelantan in the north. Malaysia had initially decided to  , according to documents seen by The Straits Times, after failing to bridge the gap in valuation since putting the ECRL under review last June. But China prevailed on Kuala Lumpur to withhold from announcing the decision, official sources said, ostensibly so that new options could be put on the table. However, Economic Affairs Minister Azmin Ali appeared to let the cat out of the bag, when he said Malaysia   after being quizzed over whether the project had been scrapped. But Finance Minister Lim then expressed ""shock"" at this apparent revelation. After days of confusion, Dr Mahathir finally explained on Jan 29 that ""some decisions were made but we have to find a better solution. We are still negotiating"". One top official said: ""Whatever is the outcome, we can't afford to anger China during this uncertain economic period, as they are an important trade partner.""","{'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.926, 'pos': 0.044, 'compound': 0.7259}",0.7259
"Changi's T5, Cross Island Line to be partly funded through borrowing",Feb 19 2019,"The cost of huge infrastructure projects such as Changi East, which includes Terminal 5 (T5), and the Cross Island Line will be partly funded through borrowing, as will other infrastructure investments such as those to tackle climate change.Karamjit Kaur Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat noted: ""For these large and lumpy expenditures where the benefits span many generations of Singaporeans, paying for them through some borrowing is fairer and more efficient."" But the Government will take a different approach to recurrent expenditures in areas like  . Here, spending will be funded by recurrent revenues  . Mr Heng noted that responsible and sustainable borrowing for large infrastructure investments helps instil financial discipline and distributes the share of funding more equitably across current and future generations. The Government borrowed in the 1980s to build the first MRT lines. Statutory boards and government-owned companies have also financed many major infrastructure projects through borrowing.  - being built as part of the Changi East development that includes other aviation-related facilities - is slated to open around 2030.

Changi Airport Group will operate T5 and take out loans to fund its share of the cost, Mr Heng said.

Passengers and airlines using Changi Airport have also   to help fund the expansion plans, with the $34 fee to fly out of Changi raised by $13.30, and further hikes planned. The Government is also studying the feasibility of using government debt as part of the financing mix for long-term infrastructure projects, Mr Heng said. Singapore's ability to plan for the long term is its strategic advantage, but this can be realised only with a sound fiscal plan, he said, adding: ""While our nation's needs are growing significantly, we must continue to take a disciplined and prudent approach."" He said recurrent social and security spending are ""necessary expenditures - to take care of our elderly, give our children a good start in life, and keep Singapore safe and secure for our families"". Many countries fund these areas through borrowing, but such borrowing shifts the burden of paying for today's needs onto future generations. ""That is not the Singapore way,"" he noted. Mr Heng said a fairer and more robust approach is to meet recurrent spending with recurrent revenues, which is why Singapore must continually review its tax system to ensure its resilience. The GST will be raised by two percentage points some time between 2021 and 2025. Mr Heng noted that when this happens, ""we will ensure that our overall system of taxes and transfers remains fair and progressive"". The Government will continue to absorb GST on publicly subsidised education and healthcare, provide more help to lower-income households and the elderly, and cushion the impact of the increase for a period through an offset package that will benefit lower-and middle-income households more.

Bicentennial Budget for...,Feb 19 2019,"FINANCE MINISTER HENG SWEE KEAT At the heart of Singapore's economic transformation are workers, said Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat. ""Our ultimate goal is to enable our people to continue to have good jobs and opportunities, and to be at their best."" A range of support measures have been rolled out in previous years to help workers reach their fullest potential, he noted. Yesterday, he announced that lower-wage workers will get higher payouts under the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) next year. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  Aimed at helping them supplement their income and Central Provident Fund savings, the enhanced WIS will see their maximum annual payouts increase by up to $400. This will take effect from January next year. The qualifying income cap for the programme will also be raised from the current $2,000 to $2,300 a month. Older workers will continue to get higher payouts than younger workers. The higher WIS payouts will cost an additional $206 million a year, bringing the total cost of the programme to $1 billion a year. Almost 440,000 Singaporeans stand to benefit from this. Meanwhile, the Special Employment Credit (SEC) and Additional SEC schemes, which incentivise and encourage employers to hire senior workers, will both be extended for another year, until Dec 31, 2020. The SEC scheme subsidises the wages of Singaporean workers aged 55 and above who earn up to $4,000 a month, while the Additional SEC scheme encourages companies to hire workers who are above the re-employment age of 67. To support the extensions, the SEC fund will be topped up by $366 million. Other worker initiatives include an additional WIS payment of at least $100 for lower-income workers as part of the Bicentennial Bonus. To help mid-career workers take up jobs in new growth areas, more Professional Conversion Programmes will be launched in blockchain, embedded software and prefabrication. The Career Support Programme, which provides wage support for companies that hire mature and retrenched Singaporeans or those in long-term unemployment, will also be extended by two years. SEE  Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) got quite a lot of attention at yesterday's Budget, with the Finance Minister talking about supporting start-ups, enabling firms to scale up and how Singapore must adopt an ""enterprise-centric"" approach. Chief among the initiatives announced was a Scale-up SG programme which trade promotion agency Enterprise Singapore (ESG) will launch together with the private and public sectors. This will help high-growth local firms identify how they can innovate, grow and venture overseas. ESG will also run a two-year pilot to help firms get advice on innovation opportunities and ways to commercialise technology from experts known as ""Innovation Agents"". To catalyse investment in Singapore-based SMEs that are ready to scale up, an additional $100 million will be set aside for a new SME Co-Investment Fund III. The eight financing programmes offered by ESG will also be streamlined into a single Enterprise Financing Scheme to be launched in October. This covers trade, working capital, fixed assets, venture debt, mergers and acquisitions and project financing. The Government will also expand the SMEs Go Digital programme to cover a larger number and a wider range of cost-effective, pre-approved digital solutions. This programme aims to help SMEs adopt digital technologies. Three sectors - accountancy, sea transport and construction - will also get their own industry digital plans, with more sectors to be added later. But it was not all good news for small and medium-sized enterprises. In the service sector, the Government will be tightening the Dependency Ratio Ceiling, or the proportion of foreign workers a firm can employ. This will go from 40 per cent to 38 per cent on Jan 1 next year, and to 35 per cent on Jan 1, 2021. For the subset of S Pass workers - mid-skilled foreigners earning at least $2,300 a month - the quota will be cut from 15 per cent to 13 per cent on Jan 1 next year, and to 10 per cent on Jan 1, 2021. SEE  Large companies will get more help to tap emerging opportunities as Singapore positions itself as a ""Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise"", said Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat. Singapore should be ""Asia 101"" for global multinational companies looking to expand into Asia, he said. At the same time, Singapore can be ""Global 101"" for regional companies ready to go international. To draw greater value from trade networks, the Government will streamline and digitise trade processes further to raise efficiency. In this way, companies can get easier access to overseas markets and make better use of free trade agreements. To encourage firms to embark on large-scale automation projects and raise productivity, the Automation Support Package will be extended for another two years, up to March 31, 2021. This includes an Investment Allowance of 100 per cent on the amount of approved capital expenditure, net of grants. The approved capital expenditure is capped at $10 million per project. Just like for smaller businesses, larger companies will have to brace themselves for the tightening of the Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) in the service sector. DRC is the proportion of foreign workers a firm can employ, from 40 per cent to 38 per cent on Jan 1 next year, and to 35 per cent on Jan 1, 2021. For the subset of S Pass workers, the quota will be cut from 15 per cent to 13 per cent on Jan 1 next year, and to 10 per cent on Jan 1, 2021. SEE  Parents with school-going children will benefit from the Bicentennial Bonus, with additional support for their children's education. There will be a one-off $150 top-up to the Edusave accounts of primary and secondary school students aged seven to 16. This is in addition to the annual Edusave contributions they already get from the Government, which this year will be $230 for primary school pupils and $290 for secondary students. Students aged between 17 and 20 will get a one-off top-up to their Post-Secondary Education Accounts of either $250 or $500, depending on the value of their home. The top-ups are expected to be made by mid-2019 and will benefit about 570,000 students. They are estimated to cost the Government $140 million. Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat also pointed out that the Government has been spending more on early education and care. It spent about $1 billion in the pre-school sector last year, more than 21/2 times the $360 million in 2012. This support continues as a child grows, with the Government subsidising over 90 per cent of a child's education. ""This means that a child entering primary school in 2018 will receive over $130,000 in education subsidies by the time he or she completes secondary education,"" he said. Children from lower-income homes get even more support through various schemes. SEE  The much-awaited goodies for the Merdeka Generation - Singaporeans born from 1950 to 1959 - were announced yesterday, and those in their 60s will have something to smile about. They get five key items: • A $100 top-up to PAssion Silver cards, which can be used for healthy lifestyle activities like sports • A yearly Medisave top-up of $200 till 2023 • Additional subsidies for outpatient care for life • Additional MediShield Life premium subsidies for life • An additional participation incentive of $1,500 for those who join CareShield Life. To qualify, they must have become a citizen by 1996. Those who were born before 1950 and missed out on the Pioneer Generation Package, but who became citizens by 1996, will also be eligible. In addition, as part of the $1.1 billion Bicentennial Bonus, Singaporeans aged 50 to 64 years old this year will get a CPF top-up of up to $1,000, if they have less than $60,000 of retirement savings in their CPF accounts. And older workers who are on the Workfare Income Supplement scheme will get higher increases in annual payouts from January next year. Those aged 60 and older will be able to get up to $4,000 a year in payouts. SEE  Lower-income Singaporeans continue to feature prominently in this year's Budget, with measures to commemorate the bicentennial geared largely to this group. A $200 million Bicentennial Community Fund will be set up to encourage Singaporeans to give back to those in need. The fund will provide dollar-to-dollar matching for donations garnered by Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs) this year. The amounts matched will be capped so that more IPCs can benefit from the fund. A Bicentennial Bonus was ann-ounced, featuring a special Bicentennial Bonus GST Voucher and Workfare Bicentennial Bonus to help the lower-income with daily expenses. The Bicentennial Bonus GST Voucher will see those with assessable income of up to $28,000 and who are aged 21 and above get $300 if the annual value of their home is up to $13,000, and $150 if it is more than $13,000 and up to $21,000. This will benefit about 1.4 million Singaporeans. Those who qualify for the Workfare Bicentennial Bonus will get a bonus of 10 per cent of the total annual Workfare Income Supplement payout for 2018. Those with low CPF balances will also benefit from a top-up of up to $1,000, depending on their age and balance, to help build up their retirement savings. This will cost about $230 million and benefit about 300,000 citizens - the majority of them female. Households with schoolgoing children will get more support from recently enhanced financial schemes, including the Uplift scholarship for independent schools, which will help cover out-of-pocket expenses. And families in need of help with transport expenses will continue to be able to tap public transport vouchers, with a top-up to the Public Transport Fund. SEE  Bad news for travellers. Starting today, those returning from abroad will have a smaller allowance on tax-exempt overseas shopping. Those who spend fewer than 48 hours outside Singapore will now avoid paying the 7 per cent goods and services tax (GST) only if the total value of items bought abroad is $100 or less, down from $150. The threshold has also been lowered from $600 to $500 for travellers who spend 48 hours or more outside the country. Meanwhile, the alcohol duty-free allowance for those who spend two days or more overseas will be reduced from 3 litres to 2 litres, starting on April 1. The moves, which come amid rising international travel, are aimed at keeping Singapore's tax system resilient and contributing to recurrent spending needs. SEE  All taxpayers will get a personal income tax rebate of 50 per cent, capped at $200 per taxpayer, as part of the Bicentennial Bonus. Singaporeans who are aged 50 and above in 2019, and who do not receive the Merdeka or Pioneer Generation packages, will also get a Medisave top-up of $100 a year, for the next five years, to help meet future healthcare expenses. All Housing Board households will also receive rebates to offset between 11/2 and 3 1/2 months of service and conservancy charges, provided they do not have a member owning a private property. Working mothers who engage the help of their parents, grandparents, or parents-or grandparents-in-law to look after their young children may also claim grandparent caregiver relief if their child is handicapped and unmarried, regardless of age. Currently, the child has to be 12 or below to claim such relief.

The oldest people in the Merdeka Generation are now 69 years old, and they will be able to enjoy the benefits of the package for many years, Mr Heng said. He added that the finance and health ministries took this into account when sizing the budget for these benefits. ""This is a significant commitment by the Government,"" Mr Heng said. ""It is important that the Government of the day continues to monitor the patterns and cost of healthcare utilisation, and life expectancy over the next 30 years or more, so that the Government is able to meet this commitment."" The Merdeka Generation Package comes five years after $8 billion was set aside during Budget 2014 for the Pioneer Generation Package.

Spain proposes $72b public investment in climate change plan,Feb 21 2019,"MADRID () - Spain's Socialist government announced a 47 billion euro (S$72 billion) public investment plan on Wednesday (Feb 20) to tackle climate change over 10 years, which would be partly financed by issuing green bonds. The proposal, which sets a goal to make Spain carbon neutral by 2050, is a statement of intent as the government faces a general election on April 28. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the plan would also be partly financed by EU funds but did not give details. The draft package includes a plan to offset job losses in polluting industries. ""We aren't proposing anything fanciful,"" Sanchez told a news conference at the energy and environment ministry, which he merged when he took power in June. ""It's necessary and moreover it's possible,"" he added. As well as a draft law, the package includes a delayed national plan to combat climate change, which is due to be approved at a cabinet meeting on Feb 22 and sent to the European Union for its sign-off. While there is probably time for the plan to be sent to Brussels, April's snap election makes it unlikely the draft bill will be approved under the current government. The government will set out a calendar of capacity auctions to work toward a target of producing 74 per cent of Spain's electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2050, it said in a statement. European Union climate chief Miguel Arias Canete has called on Europe to cut net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. Overall, Spain's plan will generate investment worth 200 billion euros, the government said, and should cut its reliance on imported energy to 59 per cent from 74 per cent over the decade. This would help the state save 75.4 billion euros in fossil fuel costs over the next 10 years, it said.","{'neg': 0.044, 'neu': 0.877, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': 0.9052}",0.9052

Mr Heng also devoted part of his two-hour speech to the importance of keeping Singapore safe and secure. ""We cannot take our peace, prosperity and stability for granted,"" he said. FINANCE MINISTER HENG SWEE KEAT, presenting the Budget for 2019. That is why the Government will continue to invest a significant share of its resources - about 30 per cent of total expenditure this year - to support defence, security and diplomacy efforts, he added. ""This spending is significant, but indispensable,"" he said, adding that even more would be spent if needed to safeguard Singapore. Turning to the economy, Mr Heng said efforts to transform it are bearing fruit, with economic growth of 3.2 per cent last year. All 23 Industry Transformation Maps, which cover about 80 per cent of the economy, have been launched, he said, noting that productivity has grown by 3.6 per cent a year for the past three years. But with global growth expected to moderate this year in an increasingly uncertain climate, he outlined measures to help companies and workers build deep capabilities so that they can stay relevant amid a wave of disruption. The Government will spend $4.6 billion on this front over the next three years - $3.6 billion to help workers and $1 billion to strengthen companies. Among the initiatives are a $100 million fund to help small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) scale up, as well as more aid for them to go digital, and new programmes to help workers pick up skills in areas like prefabrication. But Mr Heng also flagged uneven productivity growth across sectors, with the service sector seeing a 3 per cent growth in S Pass and work permit holders per year, or 34,000 in the last three years. Calling this trend unsustainable, he said: ""Our workforce growth is tapering, and if we do not use this narrow window to double down on restructuring, our companies will find it even harder in the future."" To that end, foreign worker quotas for the service sector will be tightened in two phases from next year, especially for S Pass holders. Mr Heng also outlined several targeted steps to help Singaporeans who are less well off. The monthly income ceiling for the Workfare Income Supplement will be raised from $2,000 to $2,300 by next January. The maximum payout each year will also be increased by up to $400. These improvements will cost an additional $206 million a year, and benefit nearly 440,000 Singaporeans in total, said Mr Heng. With healthcare needs growing, he said a scheme that subsidises primary care and basic dental care for lower-to middle-income families will be improved and extended to cover all Singaporeans for chronic conditions. A $5.1 billion fund has also been set up to fund long-term care support measures such as ElderFund and CareShield Life subsidies. Despite these spending initiatives, Mr Heng also stressed the need to maintain fiscal discipline. Recurrent revenues must meet recurrent spending in areas such as healthcare and defence, he said. ""Many countries have taken the easier route by funding these recurrent expenditures through borrowing. We must not do this, as such borrowing shifts the burden of paying for today's needs onto future generations. That is not the Singapore way,"" he said. The tax system must hence be continually reviewed, he said, announcing that returning travellers will have a smaller allowance on tax-exempt overseas shopping and duty-free alcohol. Overall, the Budget remains expansionary, with ministries expected to spend $80.3 billion - 1.6 per cent higher than the year before. An overall deficit of $3.5 billion is projected, which Mr Heng said will be funded by previous surpluses. Singapore Business Federation chairman Teo Siong Seng said the Budget is a ""well-balanced and progressive"" one that encourages companies to continue to transform and prepare for the future. Parliament will sit from next Tuesday to March 8, and MPs will debate the Budget as well as spending plans of the various ministries.

Large firms will get customised support from the Economic Development Board, ESG and other agencies, while SMEs will be supported through ""scalable solutions"". These measures come amid an expected moderation of global economic growth this year. Singapore's economy grew by 3.2 per cent in 2018 compared with 3.9 per cent in 2017.

Part of the productivity boosts arise from the Government's support of SMEs, many of which would otherwise be hard-pressed for resources to beat industrial disruption, said business owners. ""Young companies face a constant challenge of being resource-or capital-constrained, which potentially limits growth and the speed to scale,"" said e-commerce platform Shopmatic's CEO Anurag Avula, adding that the measures to support SMEs are ""very encouraging"". Food manufacturer Golden Bridge had tapped the Lean Enterprise Development Scheme and partnered local institutes to help automate production and raise efficiency. These have enabled it to be competitive against other manufacturers in Europe, where it is now seeking to expand, said operations director Ong Chew Yong. While the manufacturing industry has performed strongly, Mr Heng said the construction and some service sectors continue to show weaker productivity growth.

Investing more in infrastructure to protect against climate change,Feb 19 2019,"The Government will be investing in infrastructure in a big way and developing long-term plans to protect the country against climate change, Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat said yesterday.Chang Ai-Lien But individuals must also change their ways and work towards a more sustainable future. ""As a low-lying island nation, there is nowhere to hide when sea levels rise,"" he said. ""To protect ourselves against climate change and rising sea levels, we will have to invest more. Together with existing infrastructure needs, our total bill for infrastructure will increase significantly,"" he said. Mr Heng pointed out that it is very difficult to project spending needs so far ahead, although the different ministries have done some preliminary estimates. ""We will continue to do our best to look forward, develop fiscal plans well in advance, and put in place the right approach to finance such long-lived major infrastructure. Each generation should contribute its fair share,"" he added. , launched in 2016, has seen low-lying roads near coastal areas raised.   is also being built 5.5m above the mean sea level.

However, individuals must also change their ways, he noted, by adopting the 3Rs: reducing consumption, reusing and recycling. Building a more sustainable environment also creates opportunities. ""Just as we closed the water loop, we can now turn our attention to closing the waste loop,"" Mr Heng said. Start-ups are already tackling the challenge: Two companies, UglyGood and Tria, for instance, have been working on innovative ways to convert food-related waste into useful products, he said. Praising the National Parks Board for its ""excellent job"" in greening the island, he said that the more than 40 per cent green cover here improves both the living environment and air quality. ""Our beautiful living environment can also be enhanced through the smart use of technology as part of our Smart Nation efforts,"" he added, giving as examples pneumatic waste collection, the use of district cooling in the Marina Bay area and environmentally friendly buildings. ""Today, our shining Little Red Dot can hold its own on the global stage,"" he said. But the work is not over: Singapore's development plans must be far-sighted and must include the country's need to be well connected within and with the world. Within Singapore, there are now about 230km of MRT lines,  . Airport and sea port capacities are also being enhanced. ""This will strengthen our role as a key node within Asia and to the world."" Mr Heng said the long-term transformation of the city must start with Housing Board estates, where most people live. ""Many cities have large tracts that slip into disrepair over time - we must avoid that. We must strive to make every town in Singapore green and liveable by rejuvenating them systematically over time."" The nation's public housing policies have been uniquely successful because of long-term planning, he said. ""Today, we are not just building new flats. We are improving the quality of life for Singaporeans through the rejuvenation of our public housing estates."" Touching on the upcoming URA Master Plan 2019, he said it would guide the country's urban development over a 10-to 15-year timeframe, ensuring that the limited land could meet the needs of current and future generations.

Ms Fam, a former lawyer, said she hopes this will spur Singaporeans to donate more. ""I am really hopeful that the dollar-for-dollar matching for donations to IPCs will incentivise giving, especially to social service agencies which are doing good but are finding resourcing a challenge.""

Mr Ameerali Abdeali, 68, head of a safety consultancy company, said that while the material benefits of the Merdeka Generation Package are attractive, it is the intangible aspect that is more important to him. ""I appreciate the recognition and validation that members of my generation are being given for our contributions to the country,"" he said. Mr Ameerali, who has seven grand-nieces and grand-nephews, also praised the boosts that school-going children will receive. There will be one-off top-ups of $150 for the Edusave accounts of Singaporean students aged seven to 16, and up to $500 for the Post Secondary Education accounts (PSEA) of students aged 17 to 20. The PSEA funds can be used to pay for fees in local polytechnics and universities, and also for skills-related upgrading courses. Young people The Straits Times spoke to welcomed the announcement that the Government will invest in long-term plans to protect Singapore from the effects of global warming. Mr Heng announced a carbon tax on this year's emissions and the Zero Waste Masterplan, to be launched in the second half of the year, which will focus on waste management and other issues.

""We are a city with the highest greenery density in the world, in which otters live in the middle of our central business district,"" said the 22-year-old, who is studying law. ""As we reflect on the Bicentennial, Singapore should also look to inculcate in all individuals a sense of care for the planet that nurtures us. This means replacing the idea that we are too small to make a difference with the idea that we each have a responsibility to try."" Miss Pamela Low, 24, a member of the Singapore Youth for Climate Action, said: ""The Government eagerly investing in infrastructure to mitigate rising tides and sharing about it at the Budget shows the urgency of addressing the impact of climate change on the national agenda as it would become costlier in the future."" But she added that Singapore cannot simply rely on individuals to take voluntary actions, and that better policies are needed to help them understand the true costs of their actions on the environment.

Britain's Theresa May holds 'constructive' Brexit talks with wary EU,Feb 21 2019,"LONDON () - British Prime Minister Theresa May said she held “constructive” talks in Brussels on Wednesday (Feb 20) as she sought concessions on Brexit from a sceptical European Union, her strategy further battered by the defection of three lawmakers. Looking tense, Mrs May met the head of the European Union's executive arm, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, on Wednesday evening. He quipped to journalists minutes earlier that a band-aid visible on his cheek was not the prime minister's doing. A little over an hour later, they released a joint statement as non-committal as one from a similar encounter two weeks ago, though this time, the talks were not described as “robust” and there was some more detail on joint efforts to fix a deal so as to reassure Britain it will not be bound to EU rules forever. Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29 but diplomats say London has less than a month to overcome the current deadlock in the British Parliament and seal a deal ahead of a regular summit of EU national leaders on March 21-22. In their joint statement, Mrs May and Mr Juncker said talks were “constructive” and their teams would press on to “explore the options in a positive spirit”.  The two plan to meet again before the end of February, when Mrs May faces a new test in a Parliament, where her minority government just lost three supporters. With 37 days to go to a potential chaotic Brexit, officials were “seized of the tight timescale and the historic significance of setting the EU and the UK on a path to a deep and unique future partnership”, the statement said. Mrs May said afterwards that progress had been made over the backstop, but added that time was running out to secure changes. Parliament last month voted down the Brexit deal Mrs May had negotiated with the bloc and she has struggled since to unlock a stalemate over the so-called backstop – an insurance policy to avoid customs controls on the Irish border. Wednesday's announcement by three lawmakers that they were quitting Mrs May's Conservative Party over what they called the government's “disastrous handling of Brexit” compounded doubts over her ability to get any EU-UK deal approved. “What we need to achieve is legally binding changes which satisfy Parliament that we will not be stuck in the backstop indefinitely,” Mrs May's spokesman said before the meeting. In their statement, Mrs May and Mr Juncker said talks focused on finding a legal way to reassure lawmakers that the backstop, binding Britain to EU laws, would be “temporary”. A British source said the talks could give Mrs May momentum for more talks with EU leaders during a summit with their Arab peers in Egypt on Feb 24-25. She could then return to Parliament next week and offer lawmakers some progress before another vote. But the EU has squarely refused London's demands to discard the backstop, saying it is essential to avoid customs controls on what would become a new EU-UK border between Ireland and Britain's historically troubled province of Northern Ireland. The EU says setting a time limit on the backstop or giving Britain the right to abandon it unilaterally, as London demands, would make it void. It says the “alternative technological arrangements” advocated by Britain do not exist for now, like mythical unicorns. In a lighthearted protest against Brexit, several people awaited Mrs May's arrival for the Juncker talks dressed in pastel unicorn costumes and waving a banner reading “Stop Brexit. Save Britain”. EU officials dismiss Britain's talk of “alternative arrangements” to avoid a hard border in Ireland as a hunt for a unicorn – a pointless chase after the impossible. While some British ministers talked up chances for progress on Wednesday, the EU has been downbeat, with Mr Juncker stressing he had no expectations of a breakthrough. Britain's Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Advocate General Geoffrey Cox were due in Brussels on Thursday and want to discuss “legal text” on the backstop with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Mrs May wants to win enough concessions to persuade Mr Cox to change his legal advice that the backstop risks keeping Britain in EU's trade orbit forever. Both Mr Barclay and British finance minister Philip Hammond have suggested the “alternative arrangements” to the backstop that Britain is pursuing could become part of the new EU-UK relationship after Brexit, not the formal divorce treaty. While that could mean a small step towards a compromise with the EU, frustrated EU diplomats said time was fast running out. “They have until March 10, maybe March 15 at the latest,” one EU diplomat said. “Otherwise, they will be forced into a delay of Brexit, or crash out.”  Many EU officials believe that, come what may, Britain will have to ask for a delay to the March 29 Brexit date, if only to give it time to pass further legislation ahead of its departure. “It's Brexit for slow learners,” said another EU diplomat. The EU hopes that, under growing pressure of looming disruptions from a departure with no deal agreed, Britain will eventually accept assurances already offered by the bloc, repackaged in a legally binding way and stating that the backstop would only ever be used temporarily and as a last resort. Mrs May is keen to get some EU concessions before Feb 27, when Parliament is due to vote again on Brexit options. But the EU is wary of offering anything now to see it sink again in the divided British Parliament.","{'neg': 0.086, 'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.098, 'compound': 0.9472}",0.9472

"Climate change an 'imminent' security threat, risk experts say",Feb 20 2019,"THE HAGUE () - Climate change threats - from worsening water shortages in Iraq and Pakistan to harsher hurricanes in the Caribbean - are a growing security risk and require concerted action to ensure they don't spark new violence, security experts warned on Tuesday (Feb 19). ""Climate change is not about something in the far and distant future. We are discussing imminent threats to national security,"" said Ms Monika Sie Dhian Ho, general director of the Clingendael Institute, a Dutch think tank. The drying of Africa's Lake Chad basin, for instance, has helped drive recruitment for Islamist militant group Boko Haram among young people unable to farm or find other work, said geography professor Haruna Kuje Ayuba of Nigeria's Nasarawa State University. ""People are already deprived of a basic livelihood,"" he said at a conference on climate and security at The Hague. ""If you give them a little money and tell them to destroy this or kill that, they are ready to do it."" Iraq, meanwhile, has seen its water supplies plunge as its upstream neighbours build dams and climate change brings hotter and dryer conditions to Baghdad, said Mr Hisham Al-Alawi, Iraq's ambassador to the Netherlands. ""Overall, we are getting less by nearly 40 per cent of the waters we used to get,"" he told the conference. Shoring up the country's water security, largely by building more storage and cutting water losses, will take nearly US$80 billion (S$108 billion) through 2035, he said. Faced with more heat and less rain, ""we need to be wise and start planning for the future, as this trend is likely to continue"", he said. The threat of worsening violence related to climate change also extends to countries and regions not currently thought of as insecurity hot spots, climate and security analysts at the conference warned. The Caribbean, for instance, faces more destructive hurricanes, coral bleaching, sea-level rise and looming water shortages that threaten its main economic pillars, particularly tourism. ""We're facing an existential crisis in the Caribbean,"" said Mr Selwin Hart, the Barbados-born executive director of the Inter-American Development Bank. Ninety per cent of the region's economic activity - particularly tourism, fishing and port operations - takes place on the threatened coastline, he said. Hurricanes, in recent years, have flattened the economies of some Caribbean nations, with Hurricane Maria in 2017 costing Dominica about 225 per cent of its gross domestic product, according to World Bank estimates. But as the global emissions that drive climate change continue to rise, ""there's not a realistic chance of achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement"", Mr Hart suggested. The agreement calls for a rapid shift away from fossil fuels to hold the global average temperature rise to well below 2 deg C. The failure to cut emissions means the Caribbean, while doing what it can to become more resilient to the growing risks, also needs ""to plan for the worst-case scenario"", Mr Hart said. Mr Ronald Jackson, executive director of the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency, said the region is trying to do that by building coordination and assistance networks among Caribbean states and looking to shore up access to food and water, among other changes. Often, that work requires persuading officials from very different ministries - finance, tourism, agriculture, water, energy and security, for instance - to sit down together and coordinate plans, said Mr Jackson. And the work has to be done quickly, he said. Last October, the world's climate scientists warned that to hold global temperature hikes to 1.5 deg C, global energy systems would have to dramatically shift in the next dozen years. ""Before the 1.5 degree report came out, we were looking at a much longer time frame (for change),"" Mr Jackson said. ""But now it's the 2020s, early 2030s. We're out of time. We have to act now."" Military officials around the world have increasingly recognised the risks associated with climate change, and moved to shore up bases against sea-level rise, curb military emissions, adopt clean energy and analyse changing risks. At the Planetary Security conference at the Hague on Tuesday, they announced the creation of a new International Military Council on Climate and Security, made up of senior military leaders from around the world. The panel aims to help build policy to address climate security risks at national, regional and international levels, backers said. ""Climate change fuels the roots of conflict around the globe and poses a direct threat to populations and installations in coastal areas and small islands,"" said General Tom Middendorp, a former Dutch defence chief who will chair the new council.","{'neg': 0.115, 'neu': 0.81, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': -0.9873}",-0.9873
"Singapore private home prices not set for 'big bump,' says CapitaLand",Feb 20 2019,"SINGAPORE () - Private home prices in Singapore are unlikely to stage a rapid rebound after the Government imposed further property curbs in mid-2018, the finance chief of the country's largest developer said. ""If we see a 5 per cent increase in home prices, I think that will be a pretty good year for the Singapore residential market,"" CapitaLand chief financial officer Andrew Lim said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Wednesday (Feb 20). ""The severity and extent of the measures in July caught us by surprise,"" he said. Private home prices posted their first decline in six quarters in the last three months of 2018. In July, the Government imposed higher stamp duties and tougher loan-to-value rules to choke off a sudden bout of exuberance. The earlier resurgence had been marked by aggressive land bids from developers and an explosion in collective sales, where apartment owners band together to sell entire buildings. ""We agree with the main view on the street, which is that we don't expect a big bump up any time soon,"" Mr Lim said. CapitaLand's profit rose 71 per cent to $475.7 million in the quarter ended Dec 31, the company said earlier on Wednesday.

Sunvic Chemical to form panel to probe further into guarantees for $44.3m in loans,Feb 20 2019,"SINGAPORE - Sunvic Chemical Holdings will be appointing, at the request of its independent directors, a special investigative committee - comprising external auditors and legal advisers - to probe further into corporate guarantees provided for loans amounting to some 222.5 million yuan (S$44.3 million), which was Its subsidiaries, Yixing Yinyan Import & Export Co (Yixing Yinyan) and Jiangsu Jurong Chemical Co (Jiangsu Jurong), had received letters of demand in relation to these corporate guarantees. In addition, the board is temporarily suspending the rights of the subsidiaries' legal representatives given their involvement in providing the guarantees. This is to ensure that both of them would not be able to enter into any agreement for and on behalf of Jiangsu Jurong and Yixing Yinyan without the prior approval of Sun Xiao, executive director and CEO of Sunvic Chemical, the company said in its filing with the Singapore Exchange (SGX). Jiangsu Jurong's legal representative Yang Guoqiang also has his rights as a Sunvic Chemical director temporarily suspended. Liu Wen represents Yixing Yinyan and is vice-president of banking and finance for China operating entities. Corporate guarantees were extended to the borrowers - Jiangsu Donglai Real Estate Development Co (Jiangsu Donglai) and Jiangsu Dahe Lvjian Chemical Co (Jiangsu Dahe). Yixing Yinyan had extended a corporate guarantee to Jiangsu Donglai, whose creditor is Yixing City Futao Rural Micro Credit Co (YFC), while Jiangsu Jurong extended a corporate guarantee Jiangsu Dahe, whose creditor is Bank of China (BOC). The company, in response to the SGX's queries on why the guarantees were extended in the first place, said that the YFC guarantee was extended by Yixing Yinyan to Jiangsu Donglai at the verbal request of the borrower and its bank to facilitate the grant of a YFC loan to Jiangsu Donglai. This was coordinated by the Chinese government, with the intent to enhance and promote the relationship between Yixing Yinyan and Jiangsu Donglai's bank. The YFC loan was a bridging loan to allow Jiangsu Donglai to repay its bank. Jiangsu Donglai had expected its bank to release the same amount back to it within one week to repay the YFC loan. Mr Liu represented Yixing Yinyan in both instances. Sunvic Chemical had earlier said that a member of the management did not have board approval before signing the YFC corporate guarantee. The company clarified that Mr Liu was the member of management and that he had executed the guarantee on his own initiative as the legal representative. ""The execution of the YFC corporate guarantee was not expressly authorised by any member of the board. No member of the board was aware of the execution of the YFC corporate guarantee at the time the YFC Corporate Guarantee was entered into,"" Sunvic Chemical said in the filing. Meanwhile, the BOC corporate guarantee was extended to Jiangsu Dahe because of a cross-guarantee agreement with Jiangsu Jurong. Under this Dahe guarantee arrangement - started in 2010 - both parties would provide corporate guarantees to help each other secure their own bank loans at the time. Mr Yang was the representative then. Sunvic Chemical also clarified that Mr Yang, a board member, had executed the BOC corporate guarantee on his own initiative as the legal representative of Jiangsu Jurong. This was not ""expressly authorised"" by any other member of the board, Sunvic Chemical said, adding that no other member of the board was aware of the execution of the BOC corporate guarantee at the time.","{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.871, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': 0.9875}",0.9875
Some companies may struggle to adopt technology to cut reliance on foreign workers: Panel,Feb 20 2019,"SINGAPORE - The tightening of the foreign worker quota will push companies to adopt technology to address manpower needs, but panellists at an event hosted by radio station Money FM 89.3 say some companies may struggle to make the switch.Sue-Ann Tan The panel comprising chairman of SME Centre @ ASME Irene Boey, UOB economist Barnabas Gan and chairman of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) Singapore Network Panel James Lee was discussing the Budget on Wednesday (Feb 20). In particular the panellists focused on the Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) in the services sector, which Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat  . He said this was to reduce the reliance on foreign workers and to get companies to upgrade Singaporean workers and build deep capabilities in sectors such as the Food and Beverage industry and retail, both of which remain very labour-intensive. On Jan 1 next year, the proportion of foreign workers a firm can employ will drop from 40 per cent to 38 per cent. It will drop to 35 per cent on Jan 1, 2021. For the subset S Pass workers - mid-skilled foreigners earning at least $2,300 a month - the quota will be cut from 15 per cent to 13 per cent on Jan 1 next year, and to 10 per cent on Jan 1, 2021. Speaking at the event sponsored by UOB, Ms Boey said the Government should be lauded for trying to get the services sector to restructure more quickly, but added some segments may need more time.

She said each market should be looked at differently. ""In this sector, service by humans is the main differentiator (between businesses),"" she said, adding that there is a need to understand the problems some companies face and why they cannot transform as quickly as the others. Mr Gan said while the switch from a reliance on foreign workers to reskilling locals is the right move, he added: ""It is not just about the number of jobs, but the quality of jobs."" However, he added that the Budget signals to businesses that they ""must prepare for the next 10 years to come rather than the here-and-now"". Mr Lee noted that the tightened quotas will push companies to look to technology for solutions. He said: ""If you look at it in the long-term, the DRC is a good thing as it forces us to think harder of the solutions available. ""If I have one nurse caring for five patients today and next time it will be eight patients, that is where technology can come in to make it more efficient."" In getting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to adopt technology to innovate and grow, Ms Boey said there should not be a “one-size-fits-all” approach. ""More than 60 per cent of SMEs are micro enterprises, which are those with less than $1 million in annual revenue, so the schemes have to take that into consideration. ""We have to consider the affordability of a scheme to a micro enterprise, as opposed to a medium or large enterprise,"" she added. Mr Gan said economists welcomed the initiatives for SMEs to innovate and grow, which were announced in the Budget. They include the new Scale-up SG programme - to help local firms grow and innovate - and an expansion of the SMEs Go Digital programme, to cover a larger number and wider range of cost-effective, pre-approved digital solutions. Mr Gan said businesses are the heart of the economy and most of the labour supply is dedicated to SMEs.

But the pay must be equitable, the Nominated MP noted. ""If somebody either can't work at full capacity or doesn't want to, then of course their wages have to adjust to some extent. Flexibility has to be there, but it has to be done in a way that is not unfair to the older worker,"" he said. Professor Theseira said the Government could study aligning the retirement age with the CPF eligible payout age. He made the point that there is a ""gap"" between when workers are legally protected from being unfairly dismissed due to age and when their retirement support can begin. While there are guidelines leading up to the re-employment age of 67, workers do not have certainty in the conditions of employment, he added. UOB economist Barnabas Gan suggested a job portal through which older workers can get part-time contract jobs. Compared with one or two decades ago, senior workers today are more educated and could contribute in consultative or mentorship roles in companies, Mr Gan said. Labour MP Patrick Tay said there needs to be more efforts to redesign jobs to make them ""easier, safer and smarter"" for older workers by leveraging technologies such as artificial intelligence or digitalisation. Mr Tay, who is an NTUC assistant secretary-general, said society's mind-set as a whole has to change, to be more accepting of senior workers. Singapore Business Federation chief executive Ho Meng Kit expects the tripartite work group to recommend regulations for the employment of older workers.","{'neg': 0.014, 'neu': 0.888, 'pos': 0.098, 'compound': 0.99}",0.99
Malaysia's defence ministry lost over $160m from land swop deals: Minister,Feb 21 2019,"PETALING JAYA • Malaysia's defence ministry has lost more than RM500 million (S$166 million) due to several swop deals involving land valued at RM4.75 billion, said Defence Minister Mohamad Sabu. Mr Mohamad said his ministry has received a report from the Governance, Procurement and Finance Investigating Committee led by former auditor-general Ambrin Buang on the land swop deals, which was discussed in last Wednesday's Cabinet meeting. ""The committee investigated 16 deals involving 2,932 acres (1,190ha) of land belonging to the ministry. In addition to the land value, the cost of the projects is estimated to be RM4.88 billion,"" he said in a statement on Tuesday. He added that the ministry was informed that a majority of the land swop projects were implemented without detailed planning. The selection of developer companies was also not done with due diligence, he said. When it came to the selection of the land swop locations, Mr Mohamad said there was ""political interference from certain quarters"". ""This resulted in parts of the projects exceeding the contractual duration initially agreed upon. Alongside this, some projects were completed, but the construction quality is unsatisfactory,"" he said. He instructed his officers to file reports with the police, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission and relevant agencies so that investigations can be conducted. Last April, former minister Rafidah Aziz alleged that land belonging to the armed forces had been swopped by a company supposedly under the control of three key individuals. However, former defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein denied the allegation, saying that it was an ""outright lie"".","{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.937, 'pos': 0.042, 'compound': 0.0644}",0.0644
"Budget 2019: Tighter foreign worker quota may be tough on some firms, say panellists",Feb 21 2019,"The tightening of the foreign worker quota will push companies to adopt technology to address manpower needs, but panellists at an event hosted by radio station Money FM 89.3 said some firms may struggle to make the switch.Sue-Ann Tan The panel, comprising SME   chairman Irene Boey, UOB economist Barnabas Gan and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants' (ACCA) Singapore Network Panel chairman James Lee, was discussing the Budget yesterday. In particular, the panellists focused on the Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) in the service sector, which  Ms Boey said the Government should be lauded for trying to get the service sector to restructure more quickly, but added that some segments may need more time. ""We have advance notice and it will be rolled out in phases, which we are grateful for, but the deferment of lowering the DRC in certain segments might be necessary,"" she said. Speaking at the event sponsored by UOB, Ms Boey noted that in the sector, ""service by humans is the main differentiator (between businesses)"", and there is a need to understand the problems some companies face and why they cannot transform as quickly as others. In his Budget speech, Mr Heng said the DRC cut is aimed at reducing the reliance on foreign workers. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  It is also aimed at getting companies to upgrade Singaporean workers and build deep capabilities in sectors such as food and beverage, and retail, both of which remain very labour-intensive. On Jan 1 next year, the proportion of foreign workers a firm can employ will drop from 40 per cent to 38 per cent. It will drop to 35 per cent on Jan 1, 2021. For the subset S Pass workers - mid-skilled foreigners earning at least $2,300 a month - the quota will be cut from 15 per cent to 13 per cent on Jan 1 next year, and to 10 per cent on Jan 1, 2021. Mr Gan said that the switch from a reliance on foreign workers to reskilling locals is the right move, but he added: ""It is not just about the number of jobs, but the quality of jobs."" However, he acknowledged that the Budget signals to businesses that they ""must prepare for the next 10 years to come rather than the here and now"". Mr Lee noted that the tightened quotas will push companies to look to technology for solutions. He said: ""If you look at it in the long term, the DRC is a good thing as it forces us to think harder of the solutions available. ""If I have one nurse caring for five patients today, and next time it will be eight patients, that is where technology can come in to make it more efficient."" In getting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to adopt technology to innovate and grow, Ms Boey said there should not be a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach. ""More than 60 per cent of SMEs are micro enterprises, which are those with less than $1 million in annual revenue, so the schemes have to take that into consideration. ""We have to consider the affordability of a scheme to a micro enterprise, as opposed to a medium or large enterprise,"" she added. Mr Gan said economists welcomed the initiatives for SMEs to innovate and grow, which were announced in the Budget. They include the new Scale-up SG programme - to help local companies grow and innovate - and an expansion of the SMEs Go Digital programme, to cover a larger number and wider range of cost-effective, pre-approved digital solutions. Mr Gan said: ""We understand that businesses are the heart of the economy and most of the labour supply is dedicated to SMEs.","{'neg': 0.03, 'neu': 0.883, 'pos': 0.087, 'compound': 0.989}",0.989
Don't expect quick rebound in private home prices: CapitaLand,Feb 21 2019,"Private home prices in Singapore are unlikely to stage a rapid rebound after the Government imposed further property curbs in mid-2018, the finance chief of the country's largest developer said. ""If we see a 5 per cent increase in home prices, I think that will be a pretty good year for the Singapore residential market,"" CapitaLand chief financial officer Andrew Lim said in an interview with Bloomberg Television yesterday. ""The severity and extent of the measures in July caught us by surprise,"" he added. Private home prices posted their  In July, the Government imposed higher stamp duties and tougher loan-to-value rules to choke off a sudden bout of exuberance. The earlier resurgence had been marked by aggressive land bids from developers and an explosion in collective sales, where apartment owners band together to sell entire buildings.

The higher earnings were also underpinned by greater contributions from residential projects in China, as well as newly acquired and operational properties, CapitaLand said. The developer agreed last month to acquire Temasek units Ascendas and Singbridge, bolstering its assets to more than $116 billion across 180 cities in 32 countries. The deal adds logistics centres and business parks to its portfolio of residential, retail and commercial property. President and group chief executive Lee Chee Koon said: ""The transaction will strengthen our presence and pipeline in our core markets - Singapore and China. It will give us immediate scale in new economy sectors such as logistics and business parks, and in growth markets such as India, the US and Europe."" On a per share basis, earnings came in at 11.4 cents for the quarter, up from 6.5 cents a year earlier. Revenue climbed 34 per cent to $1.62 billion, up from $1.21 billion for the year-ago period. This was mainly due to higher handover of units from residential projects in China and Vietnam, as well as rental revenue from newly acquired or operational properties in Singapore, China, Germany and the United States. Residential projects that contributed to the revenue this quarter were Vermont Hills in Beijing, New Horizon in Shanghai, and Century Park East in Chengdu, as well as Sky Habitat and The Interlace here. The two core markets of Singapore and China accounted for 75.9 per cent of the group's revenue, up from 74.5 per cent for the year-ago quarter. The board is proposing a dividend of 12 cents a share for financial year 2018, unchanged from the previous financial year. Full-year net profit was up 12.3 per cent to $1.76 billion, as revenue rose 21.3 per cent to $5.6 billion. This translated to earnings per share of 42.1 cents for the 12 months ended Dec 31, up from 37 cents in the preceding year. The group said having a ""diversified asset base with strong operating expertise"" has allowed it to navigate macroeconomic uncertainties that affected market and business sentiments in FY2018.

STI reverses Tuesday's losses with 0.6% gain,Feb 21 2019,"Local shares showed some life yesterday after a tepid start to the week, although there was not much to write home about in the end. The extra buzz about the place allowed the Straits Times Index (STI) to reverse Tuesday's losses with a gain of 0.57 per cent, or 18.58 points, to 3,278.38. There were 1.35 billion shares worth $1.12 billion traded, with gainers trumping losers 249 to 167. Only five of the 30 STI constituents ended in the red but they included DBS, which fell 0.08 per cent to $25.08. News broke yesterday morning that the bank is revamping its retail stock-brokerage operations and exploring alternative models to its broking arm, DBS Vickers. It is believed a townhall meeting has been called amid rumours that DBS plans to move good performers into wealth management and drop non-performing remisiers. DBS had earlier reported fourth-quarter results, which missed some forecasts, with analysts cutting their target prices for the counter. Other decliners yesterday included Creative Technology, which fell 0.82 per cent to $4.81, despite having been ""blessed"" by Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, in one trader's words. But that bit of gloom did not dampen spirits, especially for Sembcorp Marine. The counter surged 6.33 per cent to $1.68 and was the day's fifth-most active stock by traded value. This came despite the offshore engineering group's sharp drop in fourth-quarter earnings, as analysts and traders said the results beat their expectations. DBS analyst Yeo Kee Yan also highlighted the fact that oil prices have risen in the past three weeks, which should help Sembcorp Marine's stock price. Indeed, pricier crude appeared to lift optimism on energy-related firms. Aside from SembMarine, Sembcorp Industries and Keppel Corp also traded up. Sembcorp Industries added 3.5 per cent to $2.66, while Keppel Corp closed up 3.27 per cent at $6.32.

Crunch time as high-level US-China trade talks resume in Washington,Feb 21 2019,"WASHINGTON (AFP) - With eight days left in their trade truce, top United States and Chinese officials were due on Thursday (Feb 21) to return to the daunting task of bridging a chasm between the world's two largest economies. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed the talks with Beijing are going ""very well"", but concrete signs of progress have not been apparent in the three months since the two sides agreed to pause their trade war. Analysts say the distance separating Washington and Beijing, and the short time remaining before the March 1 deadline, make it likely the outcome would feature banner announcements but would fall short of Mr Trump's most far-reaching goals. ""I think the consensus of people that have been following this thing is that they're not making nearly as much progress as the President tweets that they've been making,"" said Mr William Reinsch, a former US trade official now at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.  in meetings with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and other American officials on Thursday and Friday as they work to head off an escalation of US tariffs. This fourth round of negotiations follow two days of preliminary talks at the deputy level. Mr Trump this week said a March 1 deadline to reach a deal was,  , raising hopes that he could delay the plan to more than double duties on US$200 billion (S$270 billion) in Chinese goods. China's party-owned Global Times, late on Tuesday, warned that raising US tariffs would amount to ""a catastrophic strike"" on global stock markets, which have been buffeted for months by the uncertainty and the prospects of slower global growth. Since July, Washington and Beijing have hit each other with tariffs on more than US$360 billion in two-way trade, weighing on the manufacturing sectors in both countries. Washington has demanded that Beijing reverse much of its industrial policy, charging that China has sought global dominance through the alleged theft of American technology, massive subsidies and the promotion mammoth state-owned enterprises. US officials have stressed that any agreement must have teeth to ensure that China keeps its promises. Demands for structural changes likely will be far harder to resolve than complaints about the soaring US-China trade imbalance, which has hit record heights since Mr Trump took office. Mr Trump has said the ultimate bargain will be struck at a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping. Mr Reinsch told AFP the two sides were likely to strike some kind of bargain. ""I'm sure they'll come up with something that will be more than cosmetic but less than we're asking,"" he said. ""It'll probably in the area of intellectual property theft and more open investment in China because they're the things that benefit them as well as benefit us."" But other changes - such as subjecting China's state-owned enterprises to free-market principles - could weaken the Communist Party's hold on power, making Chinese officials very reluctant to budge, he added. Meanwhile, China's economy has begun slowing sharply as well, eroding prospects for global growth this year. Japan reported on Tuesday that China-bound exports had dived 17.4 per cent last month, the biggest drop in three years as demand there tumbled. But research by the Institute for International Finance, the impact of punitive US tariffs on US$250 billion in Chinese goods has been partly offset by last year's 6 per cent depreciation of the currency. While that softened much of the blow China's exports and on the US consumer, Institute of International Finance chief economist Robin Brooks told AFP it has hit the bottom line of Chinese companies. Mr Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a former US trade official now at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said he expected China to make a mega-bucks offer to buy more American exports - and possibly even unilaterally remove tariffs on US goods. ""I'm thinking there'll be an eye-catching announcement as to how much China will buy in the next year or so that will enable Trump to say 'victory! victory!'"" he told AFP. But should the agreement fail to hold - causing Washington to impose more tariffs while accusing Beijing of backsliding - that could pose prove embarrassing for the Americans, he said. ""The question is a year from now, as we're going into the election cycle, how a renewal of testy trade relations with China will play politically and in the markets,"" Mr Hufbauer said.","{'neg': 0.076, 'neu': 0.825, 'pos': 0.099, 'compound': 0.9528}",0.9528
The $43 trillion pushing fossil fuel CEOs to act on climate change,Feb 21 2019,"LONDON () - Behind Glencore Plc's decision to limit coal investment is a little-known, but powerful group of investors. Glencore made its decision after facing pressure from a shareholder network known as Climate Action 100+, which has the backing of more than 300 investors managing US$32 trillion (S$43 trillion). The group was founded a little over a year ago, but has already extracted reforms from oil heavyweights, like BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. ""If Glencore says that it doesn't see coal having a growing future than other people will stand up and take notice,"" said Edward Mason, the head of responsible investment at the Church Commissioners for England. ""This is not a easy position for Glencore."" He was part of the discussions with the company, calling the talks ""an intensive engagement process"". While sceptics might regard Glencore's changes as minimal (the company still stands to reap billions from its huge coal business), the announcement still shows the influence that investors hold at being able to push even the most reticent companies to respond to their demands. Business forces are now aligning on climate change in ways that will reshape energy and mining for years to come, even with US President Donald Trump steadfast in his commitment to expanding the coal industry. Other mining companies have exited the coal business or pledge not to invest, and oil producers have vowed to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Climate Action 100+ says its goal is to drive change at the companies contributing the most greenhouse gas emissions. Its roster includes the biggest names in the industry, including California Public Employees' Retirement System, Allianz SE and HSBC Global Asset Management. The group pushes companies to take action to reduce greenhouses gases and disclose more information about how the business will be affected by a hotter climate. Steelmakers are also coming under scrutiny. Climate Action 100+ recently published a report with their expectations for large steel companies, saying it wants the industry to lower emissions in line with the Paris climate accord. While investors are cheering the move, it's still an open question whether the companies are doing enough on climate change. Coal remains Glencore's chief money maker among its industrial assets. In recent years, as other companies retreated from coal, Glencore ramped up the business by picking up mines in Australia. Glencore's executives ""probably weren't going to expand in coal anyway, but now they've got a message out there that sounds like supply reduction, which will appeal to ESG funds that may have dismissed them in the past,"" said Richard Knights, an analyst at Liberum Capital Markets in London, referring to funds that buy based on environmental, social and governance criteria. Still, the fact that companies are yielding to investor demands shows that times are changing. In the past, big oil and mining companies were able to fight off pressure from environmental activists who demanded sweeping business changes.","{'neg': 0.051, 'neu': 0.869, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': 0.946}",0.946
'Kaesong is the answer': South Koreans pin hopes on shuttered complex,Feb 21 2019,"SEOUL (AFP) - It has been three years since Park Yong-man's factory was shuttered amid weapons tests and soaring tensions, but next week's summit between the United States and North Korea may well signal the South Korean businessman's lucrative return to the North. His textile company, which employed around 300 North Korean workers, was one of 125 southern firms operating in the , a highly symbolic cross-border business project that made hundreds of millions of dollars for Pyongyang. Seoul shut down the complex in response to a nuclear test and missile launches by the North, claiming that profits from the North Korean border city were funding Pyongyang's provocations. Despite toughened international sanctions against the North for its weapons programmes - which currently make restarting Kaesong almost impossible - the recent rapprochement on the Korean peninsula has renewed hopes for businessmen like Mr Park. ""This will be my fourth excruciating year,"" said Mr Park, who has struggled to keep his business afloat since leaving Kaesong, where he had access to hard-working, low-cost skilled labour. Like other businessmen in Kaesong, Mr Park paid the North Korean government US$70 (S$94.55) a month for each worker it provided - and critics say employees may have received only a fraction of that. Since the closure, Mr Park said he had visited more than a dozen countries trying to find the ideal base for his operations. Keep up with the latest in the region with the ST Asian Insider newsletter, delivered to your inbox every weekday By signing up, you agree to our   and  ""And the answer was Kaesong,"" he added. He now runs two factories in China and Vietnam and a small production line in the basement of his Seoul office. When AFP visited, five workers were diligently stitching uniforms for a Saudi Arabian cement company in a room ringing with the soft whir of sewing machines. A survey conducted by the Korea Federation of Small and Medium Business last year showed that 96 per cent of South Korean firms who had operations at Kaesong wished to return. Normalising operations at the complex was one of the key agreements reached between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the South's President Moon Jae-in at their summit in Pyongyang last September. Mr Kim said earlier this year that he wanted to reopen Kaesong ""without any preconditions"". The dovish Mr Moon has called cross-border economic cooperation ""a blessing"", but an intricate web of sanctions tightened since the 2016 closure has halted further action. ""For now, reopening the Kaesong Industrial Complex is hard,"" said Mr Kim Kwang-gil, a lawyer who was stationed in the factory zone from 2004 to 2013. The new measures include bans on forming joint ventures with Pyongyang and operating financial institutions, such as a bank for the payment of wages, inside the impoverished state. The United Nations sanctions also prevent textile exports from North Korea - a key product manufactured by Kaesong firms - and the US has banned all products manufactured with North Korean labour. The transfer of bulk cash for workers' wages is banned by the 15-member council and paying North Korea in US dollars, as it did before the shutdown, would now be a violation of Washington's sanctions. Seoul could seek exemptions from the UN, Mr Kim Kwang-gil said, as it did for a cross-border railway project last year. But these exemptions have so far been temporary and would not be ideal for guaranteeing Kaesong's future, said Korea Economic Institute senior director Troy Stangarone. Washington is reportedly mulling over sanctions relief for Pyongyang in exchange for a significant denuclearisation step ahead of Mr Trump and Mr Kim's second summit in Hanoi. Ahead of the summit, Mr Moon told Mr Trump that Seoul was willing to ""share the burden"" with the US by resuming joint economic projects with the North, supporting it as it goes through the denuclearisation process. The biggest sticking point in restarting the factory park is its potential use as a cash cow for the nuclear-armed North. In 2017, Mr Moon denied claims by his predecessor that around 70 per cent of some US$546 million spent at Kaesong was used for developing Pyongyang's arsenal. The North's weapons programme ""benefited"" from Kaesong, Mr Stangarone said, even if it did not directly finance it. ""It helped provide Pyongyang with the hard currency it needed to make purchases internationally - some legitimate, some related to its weapons programmes,"" he added. South Korean foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha told lawmakers last month that Seoul needed ways to reopen the complex without an inflow of hard currency. Lawyer Kim suggested that retailers could open outlets in the complex where employers would pay for workers' purchases.","{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.868, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': 0.5774}",0.5774
Netanyahu's strongest challengers form alliance for Israeli election,Feb 21 2019,"JERUSALEM () - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's strongest challengers in an election in April joined forces on Thursday (Feb 21), adding potency to the centrist candidates' bid to end the right-wing leader's decade in power. The alliance between the parties of former military chief Benny Gantz and former finance minister Yair Lapid shook up the political scene and, for the first time, opinion polls showed Netanyahu's Likud party trailing. “Each of us has an ego, each of us has an agenda. But looking at the country, which is so precious to us, being torn apart, we put our egos aside, created a single agenda, formed one party,” Gantz said in a speech to supporters. “On April 9, we will win big in the election.”  Should their new party, named Blue and White after the colours of the Israeli flag, emerge as the largest and secure a majority coalition in parliament, Gantz and Lapid have agreed on a rotation for the prime minister's post – Gantz holding the office for two-and-a-half years before Lapid takes over. In their campaigns, both candidates have portrayed Netanyahu, who would become Israel's longest-serving prime minister this summer if he wins the April 9 ballot, as haughty with power and criminally corrupt. In response, Netanyahu appealed to his right-wing base, warning that his opponents would make far-reaching concessions to the Palestinians that would “endanger” Israel and ruin the economy.  He told potential swing voters: “Do not be tempted.” “It's important that we continue to lead the country our way, on a path of success, security, prosperity. But tonight I want to tell you honestly, it's not at all a sure thing,” Netanyahu said in a speech broadcast in prime time. Two polls released late on Thursday on Israeli TV channels predicted Blue and White winning 36 seats in the 120-member parliament, with Likud getting 26 in one survey and 30 in the other. After the ballot, the biggest party will likely be chosen to form a governing coalition, but the polls showed a number of smaller parties hovering around the cut-off line, pointing to no clear right- or left-wing majority. While Gantz and Lapid worked out their deal, Netanyahu helped negotiate the merger of two far-right parties, Jewish Home and Jewish Power, that could give followers of the late anti-Arab rabbi, Meir Kahane, a stronger voice in politics and help the prime minister in coalition-building. Netanyahu faces possible indictment in three corruption investigations. He denies any wrongdoing and has said he will remain in office even if Israel's attorney-general decides to accept police recommendations to indict him. But political commentators have said coalition partners might press for him to step down.","{'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.846, 'pos': 0.123, 'compound': 0.9874}",0.9874
Tighter foreign worker rules in Budget a 'surgical' move: Chan Chun Sing,Feb 21 2019,"SINGAPORE () - Singapore's Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing said the tightening in foreign worker rules announced in the Budget this week was a ""surgical"" move targeted at specific industries to make the labour market more sustainable. The aim is ""to make sure that the Singapore foreign manpower dependency is on a sustainable trajectory"", Mr Chan said in an interview with Bloomberg Television's Haslinda Amin in Singapore. ""We are not going to have an unlimited number of foreign workers in Singapore but what we have and what we want is a higher quality of foreign workers."" Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat said in his Budget speech on Monday (Feb 18) that quotas for foreign workers in services industries, such as food and retail, will be lowered from next year to help boost productivity and curb labour growth. Mr Chan said Singapore would remain open to talent, particularly in industries such as artificial intelligence and financial technology, and is ""playing for the long game"" with this Budget. He said the government wanted to guide firms towards being more ""manpower-lean"" while reassuring them that this would reap longer-run benefits. ""I don't think we run our foreign workers policy on a feast-and-famine strategy,"" he said. ""We want to have a smooth trajectory to allow our firms the ability to plan long-term."" He said the government will announce measures to help small businesses adjust to these new policies during post-Budget Parliament sessions. Outside of moulding the domestic workforce, Mr Chan said Singapore is positioning itself to remain neutral and open to both the US and China amid mounting tensions between the world's two largest economies. ""Our role is to keep asking ourselves how we can value-add to China and the US at the same time,"" Mr Chan said. ""We play in a space where we want to remain neutral, remain open so that this is a place where US, China, Europe can come, be engaged and conduct productive economic activities - and I think that's how we position ourselves."" That's part of a bigger pitch that the city state has been making to attract others that might follow Dyson Ltd, whose billionaire owner announced last month the company would shift its headquarters to Singapore from the UK. Mr Chan also flagged longer-term business and political certainty, ""superior connectivity"", and strong intellectual property laws as selling points for those foreign firms to relocate to Singapore.

Asia's tumbling exports signal trade pain has room to run,Feb 21 2019,"TOKYO () - Key exporters Japan and South Korea provided fresh evidence over the past two days that the slump in global trade has further to run, and is beginning to spread to factories. South Korea's total exports tumbled by 12 per cent during the first 20 days of February, while shipments of semiconductors, a key driver of growth, dropped by 27 per cent. A day earlier Japan reported that exports fell 8.4 per cent in January from a year earlier, the first back-to-back fall in more than two years. One common denominator: both countries' shipments to China fell sharply, as that nation's cooling economy, the US-China trade war, and a slowing of the global technology cycle all take a toll on world trade. Declining activity at ports in Hong Kong and Singapore, two of the world's busiest, also demonstrate the impact of weaker demand for Chinese goods. Japan's exports to China dropped 17 per cent in January, while Korea's fell 14 per cent in the first 20 days of February. The shipments to China were likely distorted at least somewhat by the Lunar New Year holiday, but the slump is in line with the longer-term trend. The slowing of trade is hurting Japan's factory sector, with manufacturing activity contracting this month for the first time in two and a half years, according to preliminary data released Thursday. Net exports were already a drag on gross domestic product growth during the fourth quarter, according to data released last week. In South Korea, external factors including the trade war and semiconductor cycle are the backdrop for a correction in business investment, the finance ministry said in its monthly economic assessment last week. Korean exports are likely to drop further in the second quarter as chip prices continue to slide, said Stephen Lee, an economist at Meritz Securities Co. in Seoul. Exports fell 5.8 per cent in the full month of January. The Bank of Korea said in a report to parliament last week that the prolonged trade war is hurting South Korea as well as the US and China, and it would put significant pressure on global trade and Korean exports if it worsens.","{'neg': 0.106, 'neu': 0.854, 'pos': 0.04, 'compound': -0.9815}",-0.9815
Britain's Hammond: Talk of warship deployment complicates China ties,Feb 21 2019,"LONDON () - Britain's talk of deploying a warship in the Pacific has complicated its relationship with China, finance minister Philip Hammond said on Thursday (Feb 21).   As Britain prepares to leave the European Union at the end of next month, its biggest foreign and trade policy shift in more than 40 years, it is seeking to strengthen diplomatic relationships and trade ties with countries around the world.   Earlier this month defence minister Gavin Williamson   after Brexit and outlined plans to deploy a new aircraft carrier to the Pacific, where London has been seeking to demonstrate its influence in relation to China.  British media reported that  because it was upset about Mr Williamson's speech.   When asked directly on BBC radio if the relationship had been damaged by Mr Williamson's threat, Mr Hammond said: “It is a complex relationship and it hasn't been made simpler by Chinese concerns about royal navy deployments in the South China Sea.”  A Ministry of Defence official said the speech had been cleared in advance by both Mr Hammond's department and the prime minister's office.   UK exports to and imports from China hit a record high in 2017. China was the UK's sixth largest export market that year, worth 22.3 billion pounds (S$39.43 billion) and its fourth largest source of imports, worth 45.2 billion pounds, according to the House of Commons Library. In his speech, Mr Williamson announced that the first mission of the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier would include work in the Mediterranean, Middle East and Pacific regions.   In August a different British warship sailed close to the Paracel Islands claimed by China in the South China Sea, prompting fury in Beijing.   Mr Hammond said he was disappointed that the Chinese had reacted in the way they had to Mr Williamson's comments.   “This is entirely premature, the aircraft carrier isn't going to be at full operational readiness for another couple of years, no decisions have been made or even discussed about where its early deployments might be,” Mr Hammond said.  ","{'neg': 0.065, 'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.035, 'compound': -0.9042}",-0.9042

As part of the Bicentennial Bonus, 1.4 million lower-income Singaporeans will receive up to $300 through a GST Voucher cash payout. The bicentennial payment, which will be received at the end of the year, is meant to help them with their daily living expenses. Lower-income workers who receive Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) payments will also get a Workfare Bicentennial Bonus. They will receive an additional 10 per cent of their WIS payment for work done last year, with a minimum payment of $100, in cash.

The rebate will be capped at $200 per taxpayer and is estimated to cost about $280 million. Parents with school-going children will also benefit from the bonus, with additional support for their children's education. There will be a one-off $150 top-up to the Edusave accounts of Singaporean students aged seven to 16. Singaporeans aged between 17 and 20 will receive up to $500 in their Post Secondary Education Accounts. The education top-ups are expected to be made by the middle of this year and are estimated to cost $140 million. Altogether, 570,000 students are expected to benefit from the top-ups. For those who are near retirement, additional Central Provident Fund (CPF) top-ups will be made available. Singaporeans aged 50 to 64 this year and who have less than $60,000 of retirement savings in their CPF accounts will receive a top-up of up to $1,000. This will be credited into the Special Account for members aged 50 to 54, and the Retirement Account for members aged 55 to 64. About 300,000 Singaporeans will benefit from the top-up. ""The majority of these recipients will be women. Many of them left the workforce early and took up important roles as mothers, caregivers or housewives,"" said Mr Heng. ""As a result, they had fewer years to build up their savings. This top-up is a way to recognise their contributions and to help them save more."" Besides the Bicentennial Bonus, a $200 million Bicentennial Community Fund will also be set up to encourage Singaporeans to give back. The fund will provide dollar-to-dollar matching for donations garnered by Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs) this year.

Additional $3.1b for long-term care; more to get Chas subsidies,Feb 19 2019,"The Government will pump in an additional $3.1 billion for long-term care schemes and will enhance Community Health Assist Scheme (Chas) subsidies.Felicia Choo The additional funds for long-term care build on the $2 billion earmarked last year for premium subsidies and other forms of support for Singaporeans. The $5.1 billion will go into a new Long-Term Care Support Fund that will fund subsidies for   and other long-term care support measures. These include ElderFund, which will be launched next year to help severely disabled, lower-income Singaporeans who need additional financial support for long-term care and might not be able to join CareShield Life, or have low Medisave balances. ""As we age, the chances of having one form of disability or another rises significantly,"" Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat said yesterday. The Ministry of Health (MOH) estimates that one in two healthy Singaporeans aged 65 could become severely disabled in their lifetime and may need long-term care, he said. Mr Heng also shared more details on the  , which was announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at last year's National Day Rally. The scheme will be extended to all Singaporeans who have chronic conditions, regardless of income. Currently, Chas subsidises medical and dental care at general practitioners and dental clinics for lower-and middle-income Singaporeans, as well as those from the Pioneer Generation, or Singaporeans who were aged 16 and older in 1965. In addition, those with the orange Chas card (people who have a household monthly income per person of between $1,101 and $1,800) who now get subsidies only for chronic conditions will also get subsidies for common illnesses like cough and cold. Subsidies for complex chronic conditions will also be increased. These changes will see an expected increase in payouts for Chas subsidies to more than $200 million a year, said Mr Heng. In 2017, the Government disbursed about $154 million in Chas subsidies to about 650,000 Singaporeans. The   The amount spent on the scheme also grew more than 10 times over this period. ""Chas makes it possible for more Singaporeans to turn to GP clinics near their homes to manage their chronic conditions,"" said Mr Heng.

To do this, MOH will study how to help Chas clinics better track their patients' progress and outcomes, and review its clinical guidelines for care at Chas dental clinics.","{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.814, 'pos': 0.161, 'compound': 0.9949}",0.9949
More being spent to give children a good start in life through education,Feb 19 2019,"A child entering primary school last year would have received more than $130,000 in education subsidies by the time he or she finishes secondary school.Amelia Teng Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat disclosed this in Parliament yesterday as he outlined initiatives to help Singaporeans access opportunities and fulfil their potential through education. ""The Government subsidises over 90 per cent of the total cost of educating our children,"" he said, adding that more help is given to lower-income families. These efforts, he said, are part of the long-term plan to build a more caring and inclusive society by giving children a good start in life and providing Singaporeans access to opportunities throughout their lives, amid challenges such as maintaining social mobility. He said the Government invests heavily to provide a ""world-class education for young Singaporeans"" to bring out the best in every child. Noting that support for children in need is an area of deep concern for many Singaporeans, he said this starts with ensuring quality pre-schools remain accessible and affordable for all families. ""Pre-schools support parents in laying a strong foundation for children - by helping to develop children's cognitive, language, social and emotional skills,"" he said. And the Government is spending more on early childhood education and care, he added. It pumped in about $1 billion in the pre-school sector last year, more than21/2 times of the $360 million it spent in 2012. He said more has been done to support those from disadvantaged backgrounds by allowing more students to benefit from financial assistance, earlier intervention and new forms of help. One such way, he said, is   through health, learning and developmental support. Since the pilot programme started in 2016, more than 900 families have been on it. Last year, another initiative called  , was set up to study issues that affect children from poorer homes and their families, said Mr Heng. The Uplift scholarship, announced in December last year, will provide $800 per year for eligible lower-income students in independent schools to cover out-of-pocket expenses, he said. ""The task force is also looking at how to strengthen after-school care and support for disadvantaged students in school-based Student Care Centres,"" he said, adding that more details will be disclosed during the debate on the Education Ministry's spending plans. To help parents with school-going children, Mr Heng also announced that Singaporean primary and secondary school students will receive a $150 top-up to their Edusave accounts this year. This is on top of the annual Edusave contributions that the Government already provides - $230 for primary school pupils and $290 for secondary school students. In addition, Singaporeans aged 17 to 20 will get up to $500 in their post-secondary education accounts, which they can use to pursue post-secondary courses in the universities and polytechnics, for instance.","{'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.845, 'pos': 0.139, 'compound': 0.9951}",0.9951

With the enhanced WIS, to take effect from January next year, the maximum annual payouts will be increased by up to $400, and older workers will see higher increases in payouts. Those eligible for WIS receive payout amounts based on their age and income. For example, 60-year-old workers earning $1,200 a month can currently receive $3,600 annually from WIS, but with the enhancement, this will be boosted to $4,000. They will continue to receive 40 per cent of WIS in cash and 60 per cent in their CPF. WIS, which was introduced in 2007, is a key pillar of Singapore's social security system and supports workers whose earnings are in the bottom 20 per cent, as well as those slightly above. Mr Heng said: ""The scheme has raised their incomes, encouraged employment and helped them save more for retirement."" He said the enhanced WIS is expected to cost close to $1 billion a year, and will benefit almost 440,000 Singaporeans. Meanwhile, to support older workers, the Special Employment Credit (SEC) and the Additional SEC scheme, which incentivise and encourage employers to hire senior workers, will both be extended for another year, until Dec 31 next year. The SEC subsidises the wages of Singaporean workers aged 55 and above who earn up to $4,000 a month, while the Additional SEC encourages companies to hire workers who are above the re-employment age of 67. To support the extensions, the SEC fund will be topped up by $366 million, Mr Heng noted. He said a tripartite workgroup set up to study the concerns of older workers will present its recommendations later this year. The workgroup is reviewing policies such as the retirement and re-employment age, and CPF contribution rates for older workers. The Government will also review the relevance and structure of the SEC and Additional SEC, in tandem with recommendations from the tripartite workgroup. ""With a tighter labour market, and more Singaporeans choosing to work longer, more companies will be hiring older workers. The Government will study better forms of support to continue to help workers to remain productive, earn more and save more for retirement,"" he said.

Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat also urged Singaporeans to make a difference, under a national movement called SG Cares, to foster a more caring society. The Government is promoting volunteerism among various groups, such as young people, seniors and among public officers. For example, the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth is working with Youth Corps Singapore to nurture youth community leaders in tertiary education institutes to rally their peers to be involved in the community.

Service sector firms will have to lower foreign worker ratio,Feb 19 2019,"Companies will have to rely less on foreign workers and become more productive if the service sector is to remain competitive.Joanna Seow That has led to the Dependency Ratio Ceiling - the proportion of foreigners on work permits or S Passes a firm can employ - being cut from 40 per cent to 38 per cent on Jan 1 next year, and to 35 per cent on Jan 1, 2021.

""We need to act decisively to manage the manpower growth in services, and encourage our companies to revamp work processes, redesign jobs and reskill our workers,"" he said. ""Our workforce growth is tapering, and if we do not use this narrow window to double down on restructuring, our companies will find it even harder in the future."" Mr Heng said a sustainable inflow of foreign workers is needed to complement local staff while Singaporean workers upgrade themselves and enterprises build deep capabilities. Higher funding of up to 70 per cent under two grants will be extended to March 31, 2023, to help firms adjust to the changes. These are the Enterprise Development Grant (EDG), which funds projects for firms to improve efficiency and internationalise, and the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG), which subsidises the cost of off-the-shelf technology to help companies boost productivity. The funding cap of 70 per cent had been due to drop to 50 per cent after March 31 next year for the EDG and for certain sectors under the PSG. The Ministry of Manpower also provides some flexibility for companies to employ more foreign workers while they move to an operating model requiring fewer employees under the Lean Enterprise Development Scheme. There is also provision on a case-by-case basis if firms need to bring in foreign workers with specialised skills that are lacking among Singaporeans. Meanwhile, there will be no changes to the foreign worker levy rates this year. Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said in a Facebook post yesterday that if service industries remain very labour-intensive and see too much growth in foreign manpower, job quality may not improve significantly and workers will face poorer wage growth prospects. But she noted that there is a global skills shortage in areas such as artificial intelligence and data science, and so Singapore must still welcome top professionals from overseas to complement local talent. PwC Singapore tax leader Chris Woo and OCBC economist Selena Ling said the lower service-sector quota will probably force enterprises to turn more to technology. Mr Woo called it ""necessary medicine"" for the medium term. Maybank Kim Eng senior economist Chua Hak Bin said the changes could lead to higher costs as firms may need to raise wages to attract locals in the tight labour market.","{'neg': 0.022, 'neu': 0.859, 'pos': 0.119, 'compound': 0.9956}",0.9956

The Budget has set aside $3.6 billion over the next three years for the Ministry of Manpower and the Ministry of Education to help workers amid industry and technological disruptions.

Giving service sector a nudge to boost productivity,Feb 19 2019,"It has been six years since the last tightening of the foreign worker quota in the service sector, but companies are about to feel the squeeze again. At most, 40 per cent of their staff can be foreign now, but the ratio will go down to 35 per cent by 2021. The measure is aimed at raising the competitiveness of the sector, which lags significantly behind the manufacturing sector in productivity. Last year, productivity growth in real value added per actual hour worked was just 2.2 per cent in the service sector, compared with 9.8 per cent in manufacturing. Construction productivity grew by 2 per cent, according to figures in the Economic Survey of Singapore. Certain service industries such as finance and insurance and accommodation did better.

Some progress has been made - iPad-ordering systems are becoming more common in restaurants, and more retailers are using RFID (radio-frequency identification) to track their products behind the scenes.

By signing up, you agree to our   and  Boosting productivity in the service sector is critical as it employs the bulk of workers here, even as companies continue to grapple with a shortage of local manpower. Already, the quota in the service sector is the tightest of all the sectors. The quotas range from 60 per cent for manufacturing to 87.5 per cent for the construction and process sectors. But a common gripe among service-sector companies with more manual jobs is that Singaporeans are not interested in such roles due to the long hours, unpleasant work conditions or lack of a career path. With the tighter quotas, bosses will be forced to move faster to upgrade jobs and improve the work conditions to draw more locals. They may also need to spend more to pay better wages or invest in technology and automation. The result of this is that consumers may need to pay a little more for their goods and services.","{'neg': 0.063, 'neu': 0.834, 'pos': 0.103, 'compound': 0.9616}",0.9616

So far, the scheme has helped some 4,000 out of 200,000 SMEs in Singapore in basic automation. The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) has budgeted some $80 million for potential beneficiaries over four years starting from April 2017. IMDA will also roll out Industry Digital Plans (IDPs) for the accountancy, sea transport and construction sectors, where innovation has been lagging. Specifically, these IDPs will contain a non-intimidating guide to help SMEs in identified sectors assess their digital readiness and explore opportunities to go digital. Similar IDPs have already been launched for the logistics, retail and wholesale trade sectors. SMEs Go Digital replaced a more basic seven-year-old iSprint initiative, which provided similar subsidies and basic technology advice benefiting some 8,000 SMEs.

About $22.7 billion - or 28.3 per cent of the $80.3 billion total budgeted expenditure - is set aside for the Defence, Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs ministries this year. The lion's share is for defence expenditure, which is expected to increase by 4.8 per cent to $15.5 billion. Spending for the other two areas is expected to be steady at $6.7 billion and $500 million, respectively. Last year, about $21.9 billion - about 27.8 per cent of the $79 billion revised total expenditure - was allocated to the three ministries.

Budget for the Defence, Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs ministries for FY2019. Even as Singapore builds good relations with other countries through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) lends weight to diplomatic efforts and ensures that negotiations with Singapore are taken seriously, noted Mr Heng. ""Should diplomacy fail, we must stand ready to safeguard our interests and defend ourselves,"" said Mr Heng, adding that Home Team agencies and the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore also ensure a safe and secure environment for all. The SAF remains a ""bulwark"" as security threats evolve and become more complex, said Mr Heng. He also cited how the threat of terrorism remains high, with Singapore continuing to detect individuals here who have been radicalised as it sees a global rise in attacks by radicalised individuals and cells. In addition, the threat of malicious cyber activities is also growing, and connectivity can be exploited to disrupt and divide society through cyber attacks and the spread of falsehoods, Mr Heng said. ""In particular, foreign actors will try to influence our domestic affairs and politics. This is not new, but new technologies have made it easier for others to mount attacks with greater ease and intensity, and with more sophisticated tactics."" To stay ahead of these threats, Mr Heng said, Singapore must continue to innovate and build new capacities to meet security needs. In the same vein, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) will set up the Home Team Science and Technology Agency by this year to develop capabilities and support the ministry's operational needs. ""These capabilities will strengthen the Home Team's ability to carry out its mission of safeguarding Singapore,"" said Mr Heng, adding that more details will be given by the Home Affairs Minister. MHA will also help the private security industry to innovate and use technology to better partner the Home Team, he said. But every Singaporean needs to play a part too in keeping Singapore safe and secure, through the Total Defence approach, said Mr Heng. At the national level, Singapore plans for the long term and takes measures such as stockpiling critical supplies, diversifying sources of water and strengthening food security. Mr Heng's emphasis comes as Singapore and Malaysia are discussing several bilateral issues, which include disputes over maritime borders, airspace management and water prices. Last December, Malaysia also announced it was considering limiting or stopping egg exports, and restricting exports of certain types of seafood. Mr Heng added that as a people, Singaporeans must have the ""psychological and emotional resilience to face crises stoically"". ""As threats get more sophisticated, Singaporeans must stay vigilant and guard against non-conventional forces that threaten to divide us."" Touching on the importance of national service and its role in forging a deep understanding that each Singaporean has a duty to defend the nation, he urged families and employers to support national servicemen in every way possible.

""Like other pillars of Total Defence, digital defence involves everyone - individuals, community groups, businesses and the Government,"" he said. S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies research fellow Graham Ong-Webb said the increased focus on defence and security issues, despite the proportion of spending staying roughly the same this year, could be aimed at sending a message to other countries.","{'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.731, 'pos': 0.198, 'compound': 0.9989}",0.9989

He said the country is today facing four major shifts: The pivot in global economic weight towards Asia; rapid technological advancements; changing demographic patterns; and the decline in support for globalisation, with some countries questioning its value. On the global stage,   have developed into a strategic competition of strength and of governance systems, and this has raised geopolitical uncertainty. Closer to home, he noted that the 10 Asean economies collectively are projected to become the fourth largest in the world by 2030. However,  . He said these need to be resolved based on mutual respect and common interests as well as international laws and norms. He added that Singaporeans must remain united. On the domestic front, Mr Heng said longer-term challenges need to be addressed, including ageing, social mobility, inequality, economic transformation and climate change. Mr Heng said the Budget's strategic plan centres on building a strong, united Singapore for the country to continue to progress. It will draw on the country's strengths and the Singaporean DNA - of openness, multiculturalism and self-determination - forged from its roots as an open port. The Government also picked up on three lessons from the country's history. The first is that as long as the Republic stays relevant and useful, Singapore and Singaporeans will have a place in the world. The country, he said, must develop deep capabilities, stay open and connected, and draw ideas and talents from around the globe. ""Singaporean talents have been making their mark in various fields, and connecting with other highly skilled individuals from around the world will make our team even stronger,"" he added. Mr Heng also noted that external events around Singapore will also shape and reshape lives here. ""Our people have shown time and again that we can take the long view, adapt with the times and thrive,"" he said. The third lesson learnt is that Singapore draws its strength from its diversity, ""by focusing on what we have in common"". He noted that while the country's forefathers clustered around ethnic and religious groups to support one another, this support today is regardless of race, language or religion. He said that as a city-state, Singapore is nimbler and can adapt to changes faster. It can also take advantage of its strategic location and ""serve as a neutral, trusted node in key spheres of global activity"".

A $2.1 billion surplus is equivalent to about 0.4 per cent of Singapore's gross domestic product. It is much lower than the $10.86 billion achieved in FY2017. If the Government's top-ups to funds and the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) are excluded, a basic deficit of $7 billion is expected for 2018. The 2018 Budget was expansionary, Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat said yesterday. Revenue is expected to come in at $73.7 billion, a $1 billion increase over earlier budgeted estimates. This is mainly due to higher collections from statutory boards' contributions, corporate income tax, stamp duties and other taxes, but the increase was partially offset by decreases in vehicle quota premiums, and Customs and excise fees. Owing to lower-than-projected certificate of entitlement (COE) prices and higher disbursements of COE rebates, revenues from vehicle quota premiums are estimated to decrease by $2.3 billion to $3.3 billion - a 41.4 per cent fall. Total expenditure for FY2018 ending March 31, 2019, is revised downwards by $1 billion to $79 billion. This exceeds the actual expenditure the year before by $5.4 billion, owing to more being spent in defence, home affairs, transport plus trade and industry, among others. While operating expenditure was revised upwards by $1 billion, development spending is expected to be lower - by $2 billion - against an earlier estimated sum. The main reason is the HSR project suspension and rescheduling of works for some public housing projects. Partially offsetting it are the higher requirements for the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2015 Plan, and the Economic Development Assistance Scheme. The NIRC is projected to be $16.4 billion. The latest 2019 Budget remains expansionary, with the basic deficit forecast to reach $7.1 billion. Ministries' total expenditures are projected to be $80.3 billion, 1.6 per cent up on 2018.

The two nations signed memorandums of understanding in the energy and agriculture sectors, including one for a US$10 billion oil refinery in the south-western city of Gwadar, where China has helped build a deep water port. Saudi Arabia also signed a pact to provide Pakistan with crude oil and petroleum products on delayed payments to meets its energy needs. ""We are creating a great future for Saudi Arabia and Pakistan,"" Prince Mohammed, the kingdom's de facto ruler, said at a reception by Prime Minister Imran Khan in Islamabad on Sunday, at the start of a two-day trip. Prince Mohammed gave no time frame for the US$20 billion in projects, which would dwarf the roughly US$53 million Saudi Arabia has invested in Pakistan in the last three years. The Crown Prince also ""ordered the immediate release of 2,107 Pakistani prisoners"", after a request by the Pakistani Prime Minister, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said in a post on Twitter. Prince Mohammed's stop in Pakistan is the first leg of a broader Asia trip that will also take him to India, South Korea and China, where he is scheduled to meet President Xi Jinping. He plans to head to India today after postponing his trips to Indonesia and Malaysia. The Crown Prince's plan to forge closer ties with Asia's largest economies comes as Saudi Arabia's relationships with the West have frayed over the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, allegedly by Saudi security agents, in Istanbul. The Saudi authorities have repeatedly denied the Prince's involvement and said Mr Khashoggi was killed by government agents in a botched plan to force his return home. Prince Mohammed's investment plans may assist Mr Khan's efforts to revive an economy hurt by widening current account and fiscal deficits. They may also help Pakistan become less reliant on China, which is investing about US$60 billion in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Saudi Arabia has already given a US$3 billion loan to Pakistan, while the United Arab Emirates provided another US$1 billion to help South Asia's second-biggest economy avert a financial crisis.

""Our current tax system is not fair in the way it treats individual tax payers, and how it treats multinationals,"" Ms Ardern said at her weekly post-Cabinet news conference.

The revenue estimate for a digital services tax is between NZ$30 million and NZ$80 million, Finance Minister Grant Robertson said in the statement. Digital services taxes (DST) are generally charged at a flat rate of 2 per cent to 3 per cent on the gross revenue earned by a multinational company in that country. A number of other countries - including Austria, Britain, France, India, Italy and Spain - have already enacted or announced plans for a DST.

"Budget links past, present and future",Feb 19 2019,"The Budget presented yesterday commits substantial amounts to strengthening Singapore as a historically aware, inclusive and forward-looking society. It seeks to unite the past, the present and the future, by adopting both a generational and a sectoral approach. The $6.1 billion that will be set aside under the Merdeka Generation Package is a concrete demonstration of national gratitude for those who are now aged between 59 and 69. Even as this generation enters its silver years, other Singaporeans gained from the Merdeka-era legacy it helped build: an economy that was modernised; the build-up of public services; strengthening defence preparedness; and forging a multiracial society. In that spirit, the $1.1 billion Bicentennial Bonus was another way of commemorating Singapore's history from its very founding. It will benefit, among others, 1.4 million lower-income Singaporeans. Yet another measure to improve citizens' lives is the $3.1 billion being set aside, in addition to the $2 billion earmarked last year, to fund long-term care support measures. Complementing these initiatives, around $4.6 billion will be invested to boost businesses and to support Singaporean workers over the next three years. Of this amount, $3.6 billion will go towards helping workers amid industry and technological disruptions, while $1 billion will contribute to assisting firms build what Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat called ""deep enterprise"" capabilities. These capabilities are vital hallmarks of companies that are strong and competitive because they maximise value creation. But firms cannot do so unless employees, too, possess ""deep worker"" capabilities - by upskilling and reskilling - and use that to benefit from opportunities here and abroad.

"Jail, fine for trio over fatal 2014 Geylang fire",Feb 19 2019,"To maximise profit, a property owner and two men erected partitions in a Geylang apartment to create more rooms, converting the unit into an illegal foreign workers' dormitory - with fatal consequences.Shaffiq Alkhatib Four Malaysian foreign workers who lived at the unit in Lorong 4 Geylang died of smoke inhalation after a fire broke out there on Dec 6, 2014. Five other people living in the same three-storey building and two firefighters were injured in the blaze. According to earlier news reports, the incident was then Singapore's worst fire in 10 years. Deputy Public Prosecutors (DPPs) Wong Kok Weng, Soh Weiqi and Jane Lim stated in their submissions that this was the first case of its kind in which deaths had occurred in an illegal workers' dormitory. After an eight-day trial, property owner Chiang Teck Fung, 60, was sentenced yesterday to 10 months' jail and a fine of $50,000. The other two men, Khah Tee Meng, 54, and Ong Kah Sim, 67, were each sentenced to a year and a month's jail. The pair were also fined $60,000 each. The three men were each convicted of two charges - an offence under the Fire Safety Act and another under the Planning Act involving the development of land without planning permission. The DPPs added: ""Such measures in the case of workers' dormitory would include fire alarms, sprinklers, fire extinguishers and adequate exits to be installed. ""Not only was this approval not obtained by any of the three accused persons, the partitions were made of combustible materials and their erection also affected the means of escape."" Court documents stated that Chiang invited Khah to take up the tenancy of the property in 2014. Khah and Ong then agreed to take part in a plan in which Khah was the official tenant. The DPPs' submissions stated: ""The venture between Ong and Khah was that Ong would finance the cost of renting the premises and the renovation works (as well as) source for tenants... Khah would manage the housekeeping of the premises. Khah was also to receive a percentage of the profits from the venture."" Chiang and Khah entered into a tenancy agreement in August that year. With Chiang's approval, Khah also erected partitions in the premises to increase the number of rooms from five to 10. Twenty-two foreign workers as well as two Singaporeans later moved into the property and a fire broke out in the wee hours of Dec 6 that year. The Sunday Times had then reported that firefighters extinguished the flames within 30 minutes with two water jets.","{'neg': 0.114, 'neu': 0.805, 'pos': 0.081, 'compound': -0.9239}",-0.9239

"Tightened GST relief, smaller duty-free alcohol allowances: 8 things to know before making purchases abroad",Feb 19 2019,"SINGAPORE - In Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat's Budget 2019 statement, he announced that Choo Yun Ting  for travellers returning to Singapore from Tuesday (Feb 19). In addition, the alcohol duty-free concession will also be reduced from April 1. Not sure how these changes affect your next trip overseas? Here are eight things to note before making your purchases abroad. GST is a local consumption tax. All goods that are brought into Singapore are  , regardless of whether they are imported through commercial shipments or hand-carried by travellers for their own consumption and usage. Examples of these goods include souvenirs, permitted food products and new items that are intended for personal use. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  GST was first implemented in Singapore on April 1, 1994. There is no GST relief for liquor, tobacco products, petroleum and goods imported for commercial purposes. In Mr Heng's Budget speech on Monday, he announced that travellers who spend fewer than 48 hours outside Singapore will have to pay GST if the items purchased overseas cost more than $100, down from the previous threshold of $150. For those who spend 48 hours or more abroad, GST will be liable on goods that are worth more than $500. Previously, GST relief was available for goods worth up to $600. The total allowance for duty-free liquor products will be reduced from three litres to two litres from April 1 this year. This allowance can be used to buy either spirits, wine or beer. The maximum duty-free allowance for spirits will remain at one litre. For example, a traveller returning from South Korea will be able to purchase one litre of soju (Korean spirit) and one litre of stout without incurring duty. Alternatively, two litres of beer or wine can be purchased duty-free. Taxes have to be paid on liquor products exceeding travellers' duty-free concessions. To buy duty-free liquor products, the traveller must be above 18 years old and must have spent 48 hours or more outside Singapore before arrival. In addition, the liquor products purchased must be for the traveller's own consumption and must be permitted to be brought into Singapore. Duty-free concessions are granted on liquor products purchased overseas, as well as those purchased at DFS Singapore. However, there are no duty-free concessions on alcohol available for travellers arriving from Malaysia. If an item was gifted and no receipt is available, the value of the good will be assessed based on the values of identical or similar goods when computing the GST variable. Regardless of whether foreign sales tax was paid for the item overseas, all items imported into Singapore are liable for GST. This is because the items will be consumed in Singapore. Last year, around $4.8 million in GST was collected from travellers at Singapore's borders. Under the Customs Act, any person found guilty of not doing so can be jailed for up to a year, and fined up to $10,000, or equivalent of the amount of tax payable, whichever is higher. Last September, a 42-year-old Singaporean woman   for failing to declare taxable goods brought into Singapore. She had brought a total of 30 luxury goods worth over $469,890 back to Singapore from France. The fine amounted to the total amount of GST payable for the luxury goods she had brought back. In July last year, a 34-year-old man was  while passing through Woodlands Checkpoint. The GST evaded on the dresses bought in Malaysia amounted to more than $370.","{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.919, 'pos': 0.049, 'compound': 0.8164}",0.8164
Tanzanian court sentences Chinese 'Ivory Queen' to 15 years' jail for smuggling,Feb 19 2019,"DAR ES SALAAM () - A Tanzanian court sentenced a prominent Chinese businesswoman dubbed the ""Ivory Queen"" to 15 years in prison on Tuesday (Feb 19) for smuggling the tusks of more than 350 elephants to Asia - a big victory in the battle to stamp out poaching in Africa. Yang Fenglan had been   along with two Tanzanian men with smuggling 860 pieces of ivory between 2000 and 2004 worth 13 billion shillings (S$7.5 million). She denied the charges. Police sources said Yang, 69, had lived in Tanzania since the 1970s and was secretary-general of the Tanzania China-Africa Business Council. A Swahili speaker, she also owns a popular Chinese restaurant in Dar es Salaam. Kisutu court magistrate Huruma Shaidi sentenced Yang, Salivius Matembo and Manase Philemon to 15 years in prison on convictions of leading an organised criminal gang. Shaidi also ordered them to either pay twice the market value of the elephant tusks or face another two years in prison. In court documents, prosecutors said Yang ""intentionally did organise, manage and finance a criminal racket by collecting, transporting or exporting and selling government trophies"" weighing a total of 1.889 tonnes. Demand for ivory from Asian countries such as China and Vietnam, where it is turned into jewels and ornaments, has led to a surge in poaching across Africa. Tanzania's elephant population shrank from 110,000 in 2009 to little more than 43,000 in 2014, according to a 2015 census, with conservation groups blaming ""industrial-scale"" poaching.","{'neg': 0.146, 'neu': 0.807, 'pos': 0.047, 'compound': -0.9732}",-0.9732

Property sector needs to focus on long term: Heng Swee Keat,Feb 20 2019,"Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat has seen financial meltdowns in his time, so his warning that ""when you have a period of euphoria, you end up with a very hard landing that you can call a crisis"" carried some weight yesterday.Grace Leong Mr Heng said at the Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (Redas) spring festival lunch that the 2008 global financial crisis illustrated just ""how interlinked economies and financial systems are, and that we will have to be very watchful of this global development and these interlinkages"". ""The development of markets in Singapore, whether it is the stock markets or property markets, is closely tied to developments in the region, particularly in Asia and the world,"" he added.

""From time to time, there has been bitter medicine, but we face the problem resolutely because we work together and we can really continue the progress,"" he added. ""Redas has played a very important role in our nation-building journey. In fact, many of you here are responsible for making Singapore what it is today."" His remarks came after Redas president Chia Ngiang Hong called for a review of a condition in the additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) policy, which requires developers to complete developing a new project and to sell all its units within five years, in exchange for upfront remission of ABSD payable when they buy residential land. ""Excessive land banking should be discouraged, but some flexibility in terms of time frame to sell out projects"" could help, Mr Chia said. The land ABSD stands at 30 per cent and limits the time frame for all residential sites, regardless of size, to be sold within five years, Mr Chia said yesterday. This policy has pushed all developers to exhaust their inventory at around the same time, and could partly account for the land price escalation in 2017 and 2018 because everyone was replenishing land banks at the same time, he added. Mr Chia warned that the policy could lead to ""a repeat of the 2017-2018 'land grab' situation in four to five years' time"". Mr Heng pointed out that the need to focus on the long term is going to be greater for the property sector, adding that ""the Concept Plan set a very important way to develop our little red dot"".

Revival of cross-border Kaesong project hinges on summit talks,Feb 21 2019,"SEOUL • It has been three years since Mr Park Yong-man's factory was shuttered amid weapon tests and soaring tensions, but next week's summit between the United States and North Korea may well signal the South Korean businessman's lucrative return to the North. His textile company, which employed around 300 North Korean workers, was one of 125 southern firms operating in the  a highly symbolic cross-border business project that made hundreds of millions of dollars for Pyongyang. Seoul shut down the complex in response to a nuclear test and missile launches by the North, claiming that profits from the North Korean border city were funding Pyongyang's provocations. Despite toughened international sanctions against the North for its weapon programmes - which currently make restarting Kaesong almost impossible - the recent rapprochement on the Korean peninsula has renewed hopes for businessmen such as Mr Park. ""This will be my fourth excruciating year,"" said Mr Park, who has been struggling to keep his business afloat since leaving Kaesong, where he had access to hardworking, low-cost skilled labour. Like other businessmen in Kaesong, Mr Park paid the North Korean government US$70 (S$95) a month for each worker it provided - and critics say employees may have received only a fraction of that. Mr Park said that since the closure, he has visited more than a dozen countries trying to find the ideal base for his operations. ""And the answer was Kaesong,"" he said. Keep up with the latest in the region with the ST Asian Insider newsletter, delivered to your inbox every weekday By signing up, you agree to our   and  He now runs two factories in China and Vietnam and a small production line in the basement of his Seoul office. When Agence France-Presse visited, five workers were diligently stitching uniforms for a Saudi Arabian cement company in a room ringing with the soft whir of sewing machines. A survey conducted by the Korea Federation of Small and Medium Business last year showed 96 per cent of South Korean firms that had operations at Kaesong wished to return. Normalising operations at the complex was one of the key agreements reached between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the Pyongyang summit last September. Mr Kim said earlier this year that he wanted to reopen Kaesong ""without any preconditions"". The dovish Mr Moon has called cross-border economic cooperation ""a blessing"", but an intricate web of sanctions tightened since the 2016 closure has halted further action. ""For now, reopening the Kaesong Industrial Complex is hard,"" said Mr Kim Kwang-gil, a lawyer who was stationed in the factory zone from 2004 to 2013. The tightened sanctions include bans on forming joint ventures with Pyongyang and operating financial institutions, such as a bank for the payment of wages, inside the impoverished state. The United Nations sanctions also prevent exports of textile - a key product manufactured by Kaesong firms - from North Korea, and the US has banned all products manufactured with North Korean labour. The transfer of bulk cash for workers' wages has been banned by the UN Security Council, and paying North Korea in US dollars, as it did before the shutdown, would now be a violation of US sanctions. Seoul could seek exemptions from the UN, Mr Kim Kwang-gil said, as it did for a cross-border railway project last year. But these exemptions have so far been temporary and would not be ideal for guaranteeing Kaesong's future, said Korea Economic Institute senior director Troy Stangarone. Washington is reportedly mulling over sanctions relief for Pyongyang in exchange for a significant denuclearisation step ahead of US President Donald Trump and Mr Kim Jong Un's second summit in Hanoi. Ahead of the summit, Mr Moon told Mr Trump that Seoul was willing to ""share the burden"" with the US by resuming joint economic projects with the North, supporting it as it goes through the denuclearisation process. The biggest sticking point in restarting the factory park is its potential use as a cash cow for the nuclear-armed North. In 2017, Mr Moon denied claims by his predecessor that around 70 per cent of some US$546 million spent at Kaesong was used for developing Pyongyang's arsenal. The North's weapon programme benefited from Kaesong, Mr Stangarone said, even if the factory park did not directly finance it. ""It helped provide Pyongyang with the hard currency it needed to make purchases internationally - some legitimate, some related to its weapon programmes,"" he added. South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told lawmakers last month that Seoul needed ways to reopen the complex without an inflow of hard currency.

'Kaesong is the answer': South Koreans pin hopes on shuttered complex,Feb 21 2019,"SEOUL (AFP) - It has been three years since Park Yong-man's factory was shuttered amid weapons tests and soaring tensions, but next week's summit between the United States and North Korea may well signal the South Korean businessman's lucrative return to the North. His textile company, which employed around 300 North Korean workers, was one of 125 southern firms operating in the , a highly symbolic cross-border business project that made hundreds of millions of dollars for Pyongyang. Seoul shut down the complex in response to a nuclear test and missile launches by the North, claiming that profits from the North Korean border city were funding Pyongyang's provocations. Despite toughened international sanctions against the North for its weapons programmes - which currently make restarting Kaesong almost impossible - the recent rapprochement on the Korean peninsula has renewed hopes for businessmen like Mr Park. ""This will be my fourth excruciating year,"" said Mr Park, who has struggled to keep his business afloat since leaving Kaesong, where he had access to hard-working, low-cost skilled labour. Like other businessmen in Kaesong, Mr Park paid the North Korean government US$70 (S$94.55) a month for each worker it provided - and critics say employees may have received only a fraction of that. Since the closure, Mr Park said he had visited more than a dozen countries trying to find the ideal base for his operations. Keep up with the latest in the region with the ST Asian Insider newsletter, delivered to your inbox every weekday By signing up, you agree to our   and  ""And the answer was Kaesong,"" he added. He now runs two factories in China and Vietnam and a small production line in the basement of his Seoul office. When AFP visited, five workers were diligently stitching uniforms for a Saudi Arabian cement company in a room ringing with the soft whir of sewing machines. A survey conducted by the Korea Federation of Small and Medium Business last year showed that 96 per cent of South Korean firms who had operations at Kaesong wished to return. Normalising operations at the complex was one of the key agreements reached between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the South's President Moon Jae-in at their summit in Pyongyang last September. Mr Kim said earlier this year that he wanted to reopen Kaesong ""without any preconditions"". The dovish Mr Moon has called cross-border economic cooperation ""a blessing"", but an intricate web of sanctions tightened since the 2016 closure has halted further action. ""For now, reopening the Kaesong Industrial Complex is hard,"" said Mr Kim Kwang-gil, a lawyer who was stationed in the factory zone from 2004 to 2013. The new measures include bans on forming joint ventures with Pyongyang and operating financial institutions, such as a bank for the payment of wages, inside the impoverished state. The United Nations sanctions also prevent textile exports from North Korea - a key product manufactured by Kaesong firms - and the US has banned all products manufactured with North Korean labour. The transfer of bulk cash for workers' wages is banned by the 15-member council and paying North Korea in US dollars, as it did before the shutdown, would now be a violation of Washington's sanctions. Seoul could seek exemptions from the UN, Mr Kim Kwang-gil said, as it did for a cross-border railway project last year. But these exemptions have so far been temporary and would not be ideal for guaranteeing Kaesong's future, said Korea Economic Institute senior director Troy Stangarone. Washington is reportedly mulling over sanctions relief for Pyongyang in exchange for a significant denuclearisation step ahead of Mr Trump and Mr Kim's second summit in Hanoi. Ahead of the summit, Mr Moon told Mr Trump that Seoul was willing to ""share the burden"" with the US by resuming joint economic projects with the North, supporting it as it goes through the denuclearisation process. The biggest sticking point in restarting the factory park is its potential use as a cash cow for the nuclear-armed North. In 2017, Mr Moon denied claims by his predecessor that around 70 per cent of some US$546 million spent at Kaesong was used for developing Pyongyang's arsenal. The North's weapons programme ""benefited"" from Kaesong, Mr Stangarone said, even if it did not directly finance it. ""It helped provide Pyongyang with the hard currency it needed to make purchases internationally - some legitimate, some related to its weapons programmes,"" he added. South Korean foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha told lawmakers last month that Seoul needed ways to reopen the complex without an inflow of hard currency. Lawyer Kim suggested that retailers could open outlets in the complex where employers would pay for workers' purchases. But that would cut Pyongyang out of the funding loop, Mr Stangarone pointed out, asking: ""Would North Korea be willing to accept an alternative form of payment?""

Finance sector urged to help drive Asean's climate change efforts,Mar 16 2019,"The finance sector has a ""powerful role"" to play in helping to offset the effects of climate change, which South-east Asia is especially vulnerable to, said an executive from the World Wide Fund for Nature.Seow Bei Yi Ms Jeanne Stampe, its head of Asia sustainable finance, told the second Singapore-France Economic Forum yesterday that in addition to extreme weather, rising sea levels and chronic heat stress, food and water insecurity will also affect the region. ""The climate-related negative impacts will result in annual economic losses of 6.7 per cent of the Asean region's gross domestic product by 2100, which is far higher than the global average of 2.6 per cent,"" she said on the second day of the forum at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. Yet despite signing up to the Paris Agreement on climate change, many Asean countries are not doing enough, Ms Stampe noted. Common reasons include a lack of funding and the need to electrify countries rapidly. This means ""non-state players must and can drive change"", she said, suggesting financiers could move away from funding unsustainable projects given that 88 per cent of Asean's fossil fuel generation assets, as well as 56 per cent of planned assets, are incompatible with the Paris targets. ""If governments lack ambition to scale up clean energy to shift away from coal, the financiers can pull away from financing new 30-to 40-year assets that will bust the carbon budget,"" she said. They can also lobby governments to create transparent bidding processes, she said at a panel about climate change. Fellow panellist Benedict Chia, the Singapore National Climate Change Secretariat's director for strategic issues, spoke about the Republic's emissions targets, such as its aim to increase the adoption of solar energy to 350 megawatt peak by 2020 and to one gigawatt peak beyond that.","{'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.5118}",0.5118

Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to bring her deal back to parliament for a third vote this week, but Hammond said it would only go ahead if the government thought it could win. ""What has happened since last Tuesday is that a significant number of colleagues, including some very prominent ones who have gone public, have changed their view on this and decided that the alternatives are so unpalatable to them that they on reflection think the prime minister's deal is the best way to deliver Brexit,"" he told BBC's Andrew Marr programme. Asked if the government had enough numbers yet, he replied: ""Not yet, it is a work in progress."" British lawmakers rejected May's deal by 149 votes on March 12. Separately, Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has written to lawmakers from across Britain's parliament to discuss ways to break the Brexit impasse. In a letter written to lawmakers from all parties in parliament, Corbyn invited them to meet with him and his Brexit policy chief Keir Starmer to discuss how to ""break the Brexit impasse"", and use as a starting point Labour's alternative plan and its support for a vote to prevent a ""damaging Brexit"".","{'neg': 0.034, 'neu': 0.835, 'pos': 0.131, 'compound': 0.9694}",0.9694
Sembcorp fires up Myanmar power plant,Mar 18 2019,"Sembcorp Industries has officially opened a US$310 million (S$420 million) power plant in Myanmar.Sue-Ann Tan The facility - in the Myingyan district in Mandalay - is the most efficient power plant in the country. It will generate around 1,500 gigawatt hours of electricity a year, helping to meet the power needs of approximately 5.3 million people. It is also the first power plant in Myanmar to have integrated solar power generation. Solar panels on the rooftop of the plant's administrative building and warehouse can produce around 106 kilowatt of power at peak performance. The panels generate electricity for on-site use so the plant will need less of the power generated by gas turbines for its own operations, leaving more for export to the grid. The plant is also one of the largest combined-cycle gas turbine plants in the country, with a contracted capacity of 225 megawatts. It uses advanced technology that maximises power output while minimising greenhouse gas emissions. Sembcorp Industries group president and chief executive Neil McGregor said: ""The plant is a state-of-the-art, efficient facility that signals a new era of advancement for Myanmar's power sector. This project demonstrates Sembcorp's ability to serve as an integrator that brings together finance, technology as well as technical and operational expertise to solve infrastructure challenges."" The plant's opening last Saturday marked the successful delivery of the first competitively-tendered independent power facility and shows the success of Myanmar's new private-public partnership model, Sembcorp noted. The project was funded by multilateral institutions such as the Asian Development Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and International Finance Corporation, as well as global commercial lenders, including Clifford Capital, DBS Bank, DZ Bank and OCBC Bank.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.909, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.9725}",0.9725

"Singapore, France to boost cooperation in science and tech research",Mar 16 2019,"A new committee has been set up to boost research cooperation between France and Singapore in the areas of science and technology.Seow Bei Yi Its work will involve research organisations, universities and companies from both countries, with the first official meeting expected in the second half of this year. Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced the initiative at the closing of the second Singapore-France Economic Forum yesterday: ""In a world that is rapidly changing and increasingly interconnected, countries need to collaborate. No country has all the expertise it needs."" ""We will all need to find new solutions to future-proof our infrastructure, manage rising healthcare costs, and rethink the role and future of education,"" he added. The move, he said, sets the stage for collaboration on medium-term initiatives and to give momentum to new undertakings. The end of the two-day forum held at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy marks the close of the 2018 France-Singapore Year of Innovation as well. This was aimed at intensifying cooperation between both countries. COLLABORATION IS KEY FINANCE MINISTER HENG SWEE KEAT ""Both Singapore and France believe that innovation is key to our future,"" said Mr Heng. ""Innovation enables us to better tackle many social, economic and security challenges that we are facing. ""Hence, we are both seeking to make (it) pervasive throughout our society, and investing significantly in these efforts."" The new committee will be spearheaded by the French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation and Singapore's National Research Foundation. French Secretary of State for Digital Affairs Mounir Mahjoubi said yesterday: ""We believe that innovation can transform tomorrow's economy and society, and that innovation is the answer to challenges we think we are facing today - only if we are able to integrate it with everybody."" He added that ""technology has to have something for everyone in the country"". The Year of Innovation saw around 60 events being orga-nised with the involvement of the business and scientific communities, including the launch of the Global Innovation Alliance, a network to promote entrepreneurship and innovation. The year was marked by several high-level exchanges as well, including an official visit by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who was French President Emmanuel Macron's guest of honour during the Bastille Day celebrations on July 14 last year. About 20 research and cooperation agreements were signed during the year of innovation in new areas of cooperation such as artificial intelligence, health and space. Mr Mahjoubi also announced the launch of the French excellence internship programme for Singaporean students. This will ""bring young talent from Singapore to France and help to strengthen university-industry ties"". The programme, co-funded by the French government, French companies and Singapore universities, will help those who want to intern with French firms, ideally in France. Nanyang Technological University, the National University of Singapore, as well as 10 French companies, such as Thales and ST Micro, are involved. A series of scientific lectures will also take place this year in both countries. Mr Mahjoubi noted yesterday: ""Some might think that the need to cooperate and propose creative solutions is less pressing than 10 years ago, but (they) are wrong.

"Luxury stores on Paris' Champs-Elysees looted, burned in ‘yellow vest' riots",Mar 16 2019,"PARIS (AFP) - Rioters looted and torched shops and businesses on the famed Champs-Elysees avenue in Paris on Saturday (March 16), on the 18th weekend of  characterised by a sharp increase in violence after weeks of dwindling turnout. President Emmanuel Macron cut short a ski weekend in the Pyrenees mountains as hooded protesters went on the rampage in Paris, leaving a trail of destruction in the touristic heart of the city. The police appeared overrun as protesters swarmed the Champs-Elysees, vandalising and later setting fire to Fouquet's brasserie, a favourite hangout of the rich and famous for the past century – as well as luxury handbag store Longchamp, a bank, another restaurant and several news stands. The rioters also looted several clothing stores and set fire to barricades in scenes reminiscent of the worst yellow-vest riots in Paris in December. Saturday's turnout was seen a test of the ongoing strength of the movement, which began in November over fuel tax hikes and quickly ballooned into a rebellion against Macron's policies, seen by the protesters as geared towards the rich. In recent weeks the protests have dwindled in size. But the interior ministry estimated the turnout in Paris Saturday at 10,000, out of around 32,300 nationwide. That is a fraction of the 282,000 people they said took part in the inaugural demonstrations across France on Nov 17, but more than the previous weekend. Last week's interior ministry estimates – regularly contested by the ‘yellow vest' movement – were 28,000 nationwide and 3,000 in Paris. Saturday's protests were markedly more violent than in recent weeks. Police said 237 people were arrested, and prosecutors said 106 were being held in custody. The bank set alight was on the ground floor of an apartment building, and fire firefighters had to quickly evacuate the residents, including a nine-month-old baby. Eleven people suffered minor injuries in the bank blaze, the fire service told AFP. The violence left 17 members of the police injured, and 42 protesters, said police. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner in a tweet accused the arsonists of being “neither demonstrators, nor trouble-makers” but “murderers”. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe visited the scene to show solidarity with the police. He accused all those who excuse or act as cheerleaders for the violence of being “complicit” in it. The rally coincides with the end of the public debates called by Macron to try take the heat out of the protests and give voters a forum to propose policy changes. Around half a million people turned out at townhall-style meetings held around the country over the past two months. But many “yellow vests” dismissed the consultation exercise as a smoke-screen. On Saturday, the police used tear gas, stun grenades and water cannon to try repel protesters who gathered at the foot of the Arc de Triomphe war memorial, which was sacked by protesters on December 1. But for seven hours they continued to be pelted with paving stones by mostly black-clad demonstrators. “There are a number of people who have come just to smash things,” Castaner said, estimating that some 1,500 “ultra violent” activists had infiltrated the crowd. “We have been too nice, that's why it's violent today. I'm not in favour (of violence) but we are ruled by corrupt people who dare to lecture us,” Jean-Francois Bernard, a landscape gardener who was among the protesters, told AFP. “Macron, we're coming to get you at home,” some of the protesters chanted, referring to the presidential palace situated near the Champs-Elysees. The presidency later announced that Macron was returning home from La Mongie ski resort where he and his wife Brigitte arrived Thursday to spend the weekend. A statement from his office said he would attend a crisis meeting on the violence at the interior ministry later Saturday. Protesters streamed into the capital by train and car for a rally they called an “ultimatum” to the president. Over 5,000 police were deployed, along with several armoured police vehicles. Macron was caught off guard when grassroots protesters began occupying traffic roundabouts in November over fuel taxes. He has loosened the state's purse strings to the tune of 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion) to try defuse the protests. He then travelled the length and breadth of the country, engaging in marathon debates with local politicians and voters. But the measures failed to quell the anger of the demonstrators, who accuse the former investment banker of being elitist and favouring the rich. The Paris protest was one of several in the capital on Saturday, where thousands of climate campaigners also held a demonstration to demand that the French government uphold its commitments on reducing emissions.","{'neg': 0.149, 'neu': 0.81, 'pos': 0.041, 'compound': -0.9983}",-0.9983
UK government warns it might not hold pivotal Brexit vote,Mar 18 2019,"LONDON (AFP) - British leader Theresa May's government warned Sunday (March 17) it might not hold a planned Brexit vote this week unless it feels it can secure a win that avoids a lengthy  .  as it barrels toward the March 29 end of its 46-year involvement in the bloc without a plan. Parliament has twice   May reached with the other 27 EU leaders at the end of last year. She doggedly vowed to bring them back by Wednesday for a third vote that - if it succeeds - would see her ask her European counterparts for a ""technical"" Brexit extension until the end of June. But May cautioned Sunday that another defeat would almost certainly require a delay so long that Britain would have to take part in European Parliament elections in May. This would mean ""we will not leave the EU for many months, if ever,"" May wrote in The Sunday Telegraph. Two top ministers then warned that May might hold another vote only if she felt confident of winning over rebellious members of her own party and its Northern Irish coalition partners the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). ""It would be difficult to justify having a vote if you knew you were going to lose it,"" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told Sky News. ""We will only bring the deal back if we are confident that enough of our colleagues and the DUP are prepared to support it so that we can get it through parliament,"" finance minister Philip Hammond said on the BBC. ""I mean we are not just going to keep presenting it if we haven't moved the dial."" Some European ministers have suggested postponing Brexit until the end of 2020. A delay of 21 months could give Britain time to decide to either keep much closer EU ties or have Brexit reversed in a new national poll - two possibilities welcomed by a range of European officials. The 27 other EU leaders will discuss their Brexit options at a summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. Hammond said the government did ""not yet"" have the numbers to win. ""It's a work in progress and obviously we are talking to a lot of colleagues about what the way forward is,"" he said. May has run into political resistance from all sides. The stridently anti-EU wing of her Conservative party hates provisions that threaten to keep Britain indefinitely locked into the bloc's trade rules. May's Northern Irish coalition partners in the DUP - a tiny group playing an outsized role in UK politics - fear getting economically cut off from mainland Britain. And the opposition Labour party has followed an ambiguous policy while pushing for new elections that could topple May. But the pressures of time and the spectre of Brexit being watered down or reversed are starting to bring May additional votes. Former pensions secretary Esther McVey - a vocal Brexit hardliner who quit in November in protests at the terms of May's divorce deal - tweeted that ""with nose held I will have to vote for the deal"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Sunday his group still refused to back May's ""blind Brexit"". But he added that he might sign up to a Labour proposal to have a new referendum after Brexit is postponed. The emerging idea is for Labour to back an amendment that would put May's deal - were it ever approved - up for a national vote. The referendum questions would offer ""a credible choice that's real for those that wanted to vote leave, or did vote leave in 2016, as well as those that voted remain,"" Corbyn told Sky News. Polls show the public just as split about Britain's place in Europe today as it was three years ago. Most show the pro-EU camp ahead by a few percentage points. But even some Britons who would prefer to keep their European identities question the democratic merits of having another Brexit referendum.","{'neg': 0.063, 'neu': 0.847, 'pos': 0.09, 'compound': 0.953}",0.953
"5 stocks, 4 updates, few investors... but that's about to change",Mar 18 2019,"In a colonial building in Myanmar's largest city, a large screen showed stock prices for a handful of companies. Four people, perhaps tourists, perhaps investors, shuffled around the floor. The clock struck 11. Suddenly the prices changed. Then, in an instant, all the people were gone. That was just another day at Asia's tiniest bourse, the Yangon Stock Exchange (YSX). Home to only five companies, it updates prices just four times a day. And those are the high points. The rest of the time, little happens at all. But, said Thet Htun Oo, a senior official at the exchange, that might just be about to change. Last year, Myanmar passed a new Companies Law that says foreign investors can own as much as 35 per cent of local firms. That, potentially, has great significance for the stock exchange. Until now, only domestic investors were allowed to trade. But soon, it should be possible for foreigners to participate too. All that is required is for the securities regulator to give the okay. Then, in two stages, the bourse will welcome foreigners based in Myanmar, followed by overseas institutional investors. That, said Thet Htun Oo, is exactly what it needs to take off. Asked when this will happen, he says some time this year. The fledgling exchange will be the last in the region to open up to overseas investors, following in the footsteps of Laos and Cambodia, which did so in the last decade. ""We need foreign investors,"" Thet Htun Oo said. Current demand is very low as the people of Myanmar lack investing knowledge, he said. And the small investor base does little to motivate local companies to spend the time and money it takes to list, and to take on more onerous corporate governance requirements. Myanmar's securities regulator has confirmed the expected timeline. Retail and institutional investors can be expected by year-end, said Htay Chun, a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Myanmar. The commission will notify the exchange that it can go ahead with the process to welcome foreigners within two months of ""getting the approval of higher authority"", he added. Specific instructions to the YSX, securities houses and listed companies will also be issued. Thet Htun Oo estimates there are 50 to 60 companies in Myanmar that are performing well and could list on the exchange. Some have already started preparing with local securities houses. He hopes there will be from 20 to 30 companies listed in the next five years. But the truth is, with 26 per cent of the more than 53 million population still living in poverty and less than one-third of households having access to electricity, Myanmar has bigger things to worry about. And the country's progress has suffered as a violent military-led crackdown of Rohingya Muslims in the Rakhine state continues to receive widespread criticism and has largely kept Western companies away. Still, Mr Masaharu Harada, a director on the exchange's board, said he is confident that foreign investors will still be interested in the local stock market due to Myanmar's high growth potential. Institutional investors, in particular, are more likely to take risks in exchange for long-term growth, Mr Harada, one of two representatives who hails from Daiwa Securities Group, said in Yangon. Japan's second-largest brokerage worked for two decades to help set up the exchange before it was incorporated in 2015. It owns a joint 49 per cent stake in it, along with Japan Exchange Group, with Myanmar's Ministry of Finance holding the remainder. Foreign appetite for developing-nation stocks can already be seen in neighbouring Vietnam. There, the equity market has surged more than sevenfold since 2012, beating all Asian peers and reaching about US$190 billion (S$257 billion) in value (compared with about US$335 million in Myanmar), thanks to an economy that has been growing at an annual rate surpassing 5 per cent since 2000. Just last year, luxury developer Vinhomes JSC raised as much as US$1.4 billion in Vietnam's largest initial public offering on record, while Vietnam Technological & Commercial Joint Stock Bank raised just under US$1 billion. With an average daily trading value of US$156 million, liquidity in Vietnam dwarfs that of Myanmar at US$33,090. To Ms Aisa Ogoshi, who manages US$3 billion in Asia-Pacific equities at JPMorgan Asset Management, the success of Vietnam has piqued interest in other frontier markets. ""We would definitely be interested"" in investing in Myanmar, she said by phone. But regional fund managers such as herself need to be comfortable with the access to management as well as other standards in frontier markets, she added. In Yangon, First Myanmar Investment Public (FMI), the listed vehicle of local tycoon Serge Pun's conglomerate, is keen to welcome foreign ownership. Tun Tun, the chief operating officer of FMI, which was the first company to list on the YSX in 2016, said he has spoken to the stock exchange about how that could become possible. The exchange has yet to respond, he said. On the prospects of it happening this year, Tun Tun said: ""I have my fingers crossed and we'll see how it goes.""","{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.862, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': 0.9954}",0.9954
Brexit spurs biggest cut in UK business investment in 10 years,Mar 18 2019,"LONDON () - British companies look set to cut investment by the most in 10 years in 2019 because of Brexit, even if  , an employers group said on Monday (March 18). Business investment was forecast to fall by an annual 1.0 per cent in 2019, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said. Weak investment by companies drags on productivity which puts a brake on wage rises and weighs on the overall economy. ""Political inaction has already had economic consequences, with many firms hitting the brakes on investment and recruitment decisions,"" Adam Marshall, the BCC's director general, said. ""Worse still, some companies have moved investment and growth plans as part of their contingency preparations. Some of this investment may never come back to the UK."" Many financial firms have set up operations in other EU countries and carmakers have reduced their expansion plans in Britain. BMW said this month it could move some output in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In 2018, business investment fell in each of the four calendar quarters, the longest such run since the global financial crisis, official figures have shown. Finance minister Philip Hammond says he expects a pickup in investment by companies once a Brexit deal is done. But the BCC said that the diversion of resources to prepare for the risk of a no-deal Brexit and the high up-front costs of doing business in Britain, as well as questions over Britain's future ties to the EU, would limit any quick investment rebound. The BCC said business investment was expected to grow by 0.6 per cent in 2020 and 1.1 per cent in 2021. It lowered its overall growth forecast for Britain's economy to 1.2 per cent in 2019 - in line with the Bank of England's latest forecast - from a previous estimate of 1.3 per cent. That would be the economy's weakest growth in a decade, reflecting a slowdown in the global economy as well as Brexit. The BCC saw only a weak pickup, with growth edging up to 1.3 and 1.4 per cent in 2020 and 2021. It said its forecasts assumed that Britain would avoid a disorderly exit from the EU. ""A messy and disorderly exit from the EU would do real and lasting damage to the UK's economic prospects,"" Marshall said. Prime Minister Theresa May expected to ask lawmakers once again to back her Brexit plan this week after they rejected it twice previously. Also on Monday, property website Rightmove said the asking price of homes put up for sale rose by a monthly 0.4 per cent in the four weeks to March 9, the weakest increase for that period since 2011. Prices in London, where the property market has shown most weakness in the run-up to Brexit, fell by 1.1 per cent.","{'neg': 0.089, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.035, 'compound': -0.9761}",-0.9761
Japan exports fall for 3rd month on waning external demand; raises economic risks,Mar 18 2019,"TOKYO () - Japan's exports fell for a third straight month in February in a sign of growing strain on the trade-reliant economy from slowing external demand and a US-China tariff war. Ministry of Finance data showed on Monday (March 18) exports fell 1.2 per cent year-on-year in February, more than a 0.9 per cent decrease expected by economists in a  poll. It followed a sharp 8.4 per cent year-on-year drop in January, marking a third straight month of falls due to declines in shipments of semiconductor production equipment and cars. The trade data comes on top of a recent batch of weak indicators, such as factory output and a key gauge of capital spending, which have raised worries that a record run of postwar growth may come to an end. Some analysts say a recession cannot be ruled out. The Bank of Japan last week cut its view on exports and output, while keeping policy unchanged. Yet, extended weakness in exports could put it under pressure to deliver more easing, especially as inflation remains well off its 2 per cent target and pressure on businesses and consumers continues to rise. Slowing global growth, the US-China trade war and complications over Britain's exit from the European Union have forced policy makers around the world to shift to an easing stance over recent months. The trade war between the United States and China - Japan's largest export markets - has already curbed global trade. Monday's trade data showed exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, rose 5.5 per cent year-on-year, rebounding from a 17.4 per cent drop in January. However, overall trade to the Asian giant remained weak, as even after averaging effects of the Lunar New Year holiday, China-bound shipments declined 6.3 per cent in the January-February period from a year earlier. Japan's shipments to Asia, which account for more than half of overall exports, fell 1.8 per cent, down for a fourth straight month. US-bound exports rose 2.0 per cent, but imports from the United States grew 4.9 per cent, resulting in Japan's trade surplus with the country declining 0.9 per cent year-on-year to 624.9 billion yen in February. Japan's still-large surplus with the United States raises concerns among Japanese policymakers and auto exporters that Washington may impose hefty duties on its imports, analysts say.","{'neg': 0.081, 'neu': 0.852, 'pos': 0.067, 'compound': -0.5035}",-0.5035
Past due debt almost doubles for Singapore construction companies in Q4,Mar 18 2019,"SINGAPORE - The construction sector in Singapore saw worsening debt payment behaviour as less debt was paid on time while delinquent debt almost doubled in the fourth quarter of 2018. However, payment behaviour was largely stable across other sectors though DP Information Group cautioned in a media statement on Monday (March 18) that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will potentially face bigger challenges in 2019 as uncertainties in the business environment are expected to persist. DP Info in a report noted that just 25 per cent of construction debt were paid on time in October-December 2018, down from 36 per cent in the preceding quarter. The percentage of delinquent debt over 90 days for the sector at 35 per cent was nearly doubled the 18 per cent for the previous quarter. Further, the sector registered a quarter-on-quarter Days Turned Cash (DTC) - a measure of the payment behaviour of SMEs - increase of 18 days from 41 days to 59 days. This represented the highest DTC for the sector in the last five years, and was the key contributor to the overall lengthening of payment settlement timelines by seven days from 33 days to 40 days among the SMEs. Most sectors witnessed a modest increase in DTC of about two days. The construction sector has been weak in activities in recent years, largely attributed to lower than anticipated construction demand for both the private and public sectors. However, there was an upturn of 23 per cent in construction demand in 2018, driven mainly by public sector projects, with the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) expecting this sustained public sector demand to continue into 2019. But smaller local players are still expected to face challenges as many infrastructure projects are being assigned to larger companies. The impact of smaller profit margins from these smaller firms may have led to the rise in delinquent payments among construction companies, said DP Info, which is part of information services company Experian. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  James Gothard, general manager, credit services and strategy (South-east Asia) of Experian, said: ""The payment behaviour across the majority of the sectors tracked suggests that despite the emergence of business headwinds at the tail end of 2018, most SMEs were still able to maintain sufficient cash flow to service their payment obligations in a relatively timely manner. However, SMEs will potentially face bigger challenges in 2019 as uncertainties in the business environment are expected to persist, leading to the management of cash flow, liquidity and credit risk remaining as top business concerns."" DP Info's SME Development Survey 2018 found that half of the SMEs surveyed had anticipated challenges in managing cash flow, liquidity and credit risk for the year ahead. The survey also determined that 81 per cent of SMEs with financial challenges cited delayed payments from customers as the main reason behind this difficulty. Mr Gothard said: ""With finance-related challenges constantly identified by our studies as a key concern for SMEs, it is heartening to see Budget 2019 introduce initiatives specifically aimed at easing SMEs' access to credit and financing.""","{'neg': 0.069, 'neu': 0.863, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': -0.5927}",-0.5927
"China's Xi Jinping to visit Italy, France as Rome joins 'Belt and Road'",Mar 18 2019,"BEIJING (AFP, , ) - Chinese President Xi Jinping will travel to Italy, Monaco and France this week, the foreign ministry said on Monday (March 18), with  despite  . Mr Xi will pay state visits from Thursday to next Tuesday (March 21 to March 26), foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in a statement, without providing more details about his itinerary. An Italian official said last week that Rome would sign a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Beijing to officially support   (BRI), also known as the New Silk Road. Italy has been split over whether to sign the MOU to participate in Mr Xi's signature trade and infrastructure programme, and is working to solidify accords with Chinese companies in areas from banking to energy. Beijing has financed infrastructure, maritime, rail and road projects in Asia, Africa and Europe, but critics warn that it mainly benefits Chinese firms while setting up a ""debt trap"" in more financially vulnerable countries. Italy's willingness to consider doing business with China is fueling concerns in the US and European Union about a G-7 country signing up for the BRI and allowing China's interests into sectors like telecoms and ports. Following Italy's announcement, French President Emmanuel Macron said last week that EU countries should have a ""coordinated approach"" regarding China.

The US has also recently issued warnings about data theft sponsored by the Chinese state.  There has been speculation that Mr Xi and US President Donald Trump would meet this month to sign an agreement to end the trade war between the world's two biggest economies, but that is not likely to happen until April at the earliest, three people familiar with the matter said. Meanwhile, senior Vatican sources have said Pope Francis is willing to meet Mr Xi and that intermediaries had made overtures to the Vatican, but the Chinese side had not yet formally asked for a meeting. Any encounter would be the first between a Chinese leader and a pope.  ","{'neg': 0.058, 'neu': 0.859, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': 0.8635}",0.8635
British PM Theresa May's Brexit deal lives: Northern Irish kingmakers report 'good' talks with government,Mar 16 2019,"LONDON () - The Northern Irish party that props up Prime Minister Theresa May's government said it had good talks with British ministers on Friday (March 15) to see what additional assurances would be needed for them to save her twice-defeated Brexit deal. The United Kingdom's divorce from the European Union has sown chaos throughout May's premiership and the Brexit finale is still uncertain. Options include a long delay, exiting with May's deal, leaving without a deal or even another referendum. May has given Brexit supporters an ultimatum - ratify her deal by Wednesday or face a delay to Brexit way beyond June 30 that would open up the possibility that the entire departure from the EU could ultimately be thwarted. To succeed, May must win over dozens of Brexit-supporting rebels in her own Conservative Party and the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which has 10 lawmakers in parliament. For the DUP, which could pull in some Brexit-supporting Conservative lawmakers behind a deal, the main issue is the Irish backstop - an insurance policy which sets out what happens to the Irish border if the sides fail to find another solution. ""We have had good discussions today. Those discussions will continue,"" DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said after talks with British ministers. ""We want to get a deal. We have always been in that frame of mind. We don't want to leave without a deal but a lot will depend in terms of what the government can do on providing those guarantees that are necessary."" In a last ditch attempt to save her deal, May is scrambling to win over the DUP and dozens of rebels in her own party. Finance Minister Philip Hammond was in the meeting with the DUP, news that at one point pushed the pound to its highest level of the day against the dollar. May says she wants to minimise any delay in leaving the EU to just three months, but to achieve that she will need parliament to back her deal at the third time of asking early next week, possibly on Tuesday. Many Brexiteers and the DUP fear the backstop, aimed at avoiding controls on the border between the UK province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland, will trap the United Kingdom in the EU's orbit indefinitely.","{'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': 0.9173}",0.9173
First parent pleads not guilty in biggest US college admissions scandal,Mar 16 2019,"BOSTON () - The temporarily ousted chief executive of Advantage Lithium Corp pleaded not guilty on Friday (March 15) to charges of participating in the largest college admissions fraud scheme in US history. David Sidoo became the first of the 33 parents charged in the scam to plead not guilty. Prosecutors said he paid US$200,000 (S$270,000) to the scheme's accused mastermind, William ""Rick"" Singer, to arrange for people to take the SAT admissions test for his two sons. Some 50 people including prominent executives, Hollywood actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman and college sports coaches have been charged in the scheme. Prosecutors say Singer made about US$25 million over eight years by bribing coaches and arranging for phony test-takers to secure clients' children spots at elite universities including Yale, Georgetown and Stanford. Sidoo, who was temporarily replaced by Advantage Lithium's board of directors on Thursday, declined to speak to a reporter as he entered the courtroom in Boston federal court. During a hearing that followed Sidoo said little except to acknowledge his rights and to say ""not guilty"" when asked how he would plead. ""He looks forward to fully contesting the charges,"" Sidoo's attorneys said in a statement emailed to  by a publicist. ""He will be returning to his home in Canada and asks people not rush to judgment."" Singer on Tuesday pleaded guilty to masterminding the scheme, which highlighted the lengths that wealthy and powerful Americans would go to cheat the high-stakes and high-pressure college admissions system. One of the schools involved, the University of Southern California, already has rescinded admissions offers to six students involved in the scheme and said it will review what actions to take against students already admitted who took part. Advantage Lithium is in the process of developing a potential Argentine lithium mine. Lithium is a critically important ingredient used in manufacturing batteries for electric cars. Others prominent executives accused in the scheme include Douglas Hodge, former executive of investment firm PIMCO; Manuel Henriquez, who resigned as CEO of specialty finance company Hercules Capital; Gordon Caplan, who has been placed on leave from his post as co-chairman of the global law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher; and TPG Capital private equity partner William McGlashan Jr, who was fired by the firm on Thursday. Loughlin was dropped by the company that owns the Hallmark cable channel and LVMH's Sephora beauty chain ended a sponsorship deal with her daughter, Olivia, as a result of the charge. Loughlin's husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, also has been charged.","{'neg': 0.065, 'neu': 0.857, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': 0.5312}",0.5312
President Halimah Yacob signs off on Budget,Mar 16 2019,"This year's Budget is ""forward looking and inclusive"" and is aimed at taking Singapore into the next phase of nation building, said President Halimah Yacob yesterday, as she gave her approval to the Supply Bill.Adrian Lim The Bill, which was passed in Parliament on March 8 after a nine-day debate, authorises government expenditures proposed in the Budget for the next financial year, which starts on April 1. In a Facebook post, President Halimah said the Ministry of Finance (MOF) had briefed her and the Council of Presidential Advisers earlier on the Budget, and the Supply Bill was submitted to her for assent yesterday morning.

PM Theresa May counts on EU for Brexit delay,Mar 16 2019,"A second referendum on European Union (EU) membership could be on the cards  British newspaper The Times reported yesterday that senior EU officials and other European leaders told British Prime Minister Theresa May that ""conditions for an extension to the Article 50 exit process would include the option of a second vote on EU membership"". British lawmakers voted on Thursday night to allow the government  Britain will now almost certainly not leave the bloc as initially scheduled on March 29. But Mrs May's party is still severely split, with more than half voting against the delay. Moreover, any extension is not automatic as she still needs the approval of all 27 remaining EU member-states - themselves divided on the idea - for an extension. Unless an agreement is made, Britain is still at legal default to depart from the bloc on March 29. Mrs May's spokesman has said that the government was still making preparations in the event of a no-deal divorce. MOST LIKELY OUTCOME PROFESSOR MARC STEARS, director of the Sydney Policy Lab at the University of Sydney. Professor Iain Begg, of the European Institute and co-director of the Dahrendorf Forum at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: ""EU agreement is likely, but the EU side will want reassurance that the extension is for a purpose, not just to permit further procrastination by the UK. ""Certainly, the prospect of a further referendum would be persuasive for the EU, but with 27 potential veto players, it cannot be taken for granted."" Leaders in other EU states have already begun to question the purpose of an extension, given the impasse plaguing British Parliament. Speaking to an audience after a speech at Bloomberg's European headquarters in London yesterday,  quoted Irish Finance Minister Paschal Luke Donohoe as saying: ""Clearly, given all that we have all gone through in watching the British political system grapple with the complexity of Brexit, there are many in the European Union that would want to be very clear on how this extension period will be used."" German Justice Minister Katarina Barley told broadcaster RBB yesterday that she believes that the EU would be ready to delay Brexit, ""but one has to have a plan on what is supposed to happen during this period"",  reported. With less than two weeks before Britain is due to leave the EU, Mrs May seems to be clinging on to her waning authority by a thread after a series of humiliating defeats. Using a threat of a lengthy extension to Article 50, she has made clear that her negotiated divorce deal is still on the table and seeks to push rebel lawmakers into supporting it, despite having had it rejected twice - in January by a historic margin, and again earlier this week, on Tuesday. Her decision to hold a third meaningful vote next week is an ultimatum for lawmakers - back her deal so that she can request a ""short, technical extension"" until June 30; if not, Britain will need to participate in European Parliament elections in May, or worse, risk Brexit not materialising at all. Still, Mrs May has an arduous task ahead. She will need to convince Brexit supporters in her Conservative Party, as well as members of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the small Northern Irish party that props up her minority government in Parliament, to back her deal ahead of next week's vote if a short delay is to be tabled. Professor Marc Stears, director of the Sydney Policy Lab at the University of Sydney and former chief speechwriter to Britain's Labour Party, said: ""Mrs May's position ought to be very weak. Her Cabinet (members) are disloyal and she has lost two major votes on her deal. ""But the failure of everyone else to come up with anything close to an alternative plan means that her deal remains the most likely outcome. She will bring it back for a third time next week and (it) probably stands a better than 50-50 chance of passing despite everything.""","{'neg': 0.065, 'neu': 0.834, 'pos': 0.101, 'compound': 0.9704}",0.9704
US-China deal unlikely to be sealed in March,Mar 16 2019,"WASHINGTON • A meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign an agreement to end their trade war will not occur this month, and is more likely to happen next month at the earliest, three sources said. Despite claims of progress in talks by both sides, a hoped-for summit at Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort will now take place at the end of next month if it happens at all, according to one of the sources. China is pressing for a formal state visit, which traditionally takes place in Washington, rather than a lower-key appearance just to sign a trade deal, the source said. Mr Xi's staff have scrapped planning for a potential flight to the United States, following a trip to Europe later this month, a separate source said. The sources asked not to be named as the details are private. US stock index futures rose yesterday as investors welcomed positive signs regarding trade talks between the US and China, and after British lawmakers voted to delay a potentially chaotic exit from the European Union. ""We'll have news on China - probably one way or the other we're going to know over the next three to four weeks,"" Mr Trump said at the White House on Thursday. SATISFACTORY PROGRESS TREASURY SECRETARY STEVEN MNUCHIN, saying that both sides were ""working in good faith"" to try to reach a deal. ""And then if one gets done, it will be something that people are going to be talking about for a long time because we have been really taken advantage of for a long time. And now I think - China, frankly, they've been very responsible and very reasonable."" China's state-run news agency Xinhua said yesterday that Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He had spoken by telephone with both US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday, and the two sides made further substantive progress on trade talks. Xinhua gave no other details, other than describing it as a third telephone call. Mr Lighthizer this week pointed to ""major issues"" still unresolved in the talks, with few signs of a breakthrough on the most difficult subjects. Chinese officials have also bristled at the appearance of the deal being one-sided, and are wary of the risk of Mr Trump walking away even if Mr Xi were to travel to the US. Mr Trump himself has dialled down the urgency of getting a deal signed as early as this month. He acknowledged concerns in Beijing about the possibility of him walking away from a trade deal, offering to push back a summit with Mr Xi until a final agreement is reached. ""We could do it either way,"" Mr Trump told reporters on Wednesday at the White House. ""We can have the deal completed and come and sign or we can get the deal almost completed and negotiate some of the final points. I would prefer that. But it doesn't matter that much."" There is currently no plan for the US to send another lower-level delegation to Beijing to iron out the details, but it is possible Mr Lighthizer would have to make the trip again to finalise some of the outstanding points in person. The negotiations have zeroed in on the phasing out of joint-venture requirements, the deal's enforcement mechanism and the lifting of tariffs the two sides have imposed on each other, the sources said. Those topics are negotiated at the ministerial level. The countries exchanged drafts in English only and China now needs to translate the 150-page document and complete a so-called legal scrub, the sources added. Any deal will have a ""very clear enforcement provision"", Mr Mnuchin said in his congressional testimony on Thursday, noting that he and Mr Lighthizer spoke with Mr Liu. The agreement also ""needs to be right - that's more important than the exact timing"", the Treasury Secretary added. Mr Mnuchin, speaking to reporters following a US Senate Finance Committee hearing, said both sides were ""working in good faith"" to try to reach a deal ""as quickly as possible"". ""There's still a lot of work to do, but we're very comfortable with where we are,"" he said.

The funds are intended to help companies cope with rising wage costs, and about 70 per cent will go to SMEs. Through the payouts, the Government will co-fund 20 per cent of qualifying wage increases given last year and in 2017, said the statement. This co-funding ratio will fall to 15 per cent for this year and to 10 per cent for next year. The Wage Credit Scheme co-funds wage increases for Singaporeans with a gross monthly wage of up to $4,000. It was introduced in 2013 and was originally intended to last three years. In 2015, it was extended by two years. During last year's Budget speech, the scheme was further extended by three years to support businesses embarking on transformation efforts and to encourage the sharing of productivity gains with workers. Employers do not need to apply to receive Wage Credit Scheme payouts. Those that are eligible will receive letters from Iras by the end of this month telling them how much they will get in payouts. The money will be credited directly into the employers' Giro bank accounts used for income tax as well as goods and services tax purposes, or their bank accounts registered with PayNow Corporate. Those that are not using Giro or PayNow Corporate will get their payouts issued by cheque. Appeals over Wage Credit Scheme payouts must be submitted to Iras by June 30, and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Brexit spurs biggest cut in UK business investment in 10 years,Mar 18 2019,"LONDON (REUTERS) - British companies look set to cut investment by the most in 10 years in 2019 because of Brexit, even if  , an employers group said on Monday (March 18). Business investment was forecast to fall by an annual 1.0 per cent in 2019, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said. Weak investment by companies drags on productivity which puts a brake on wage rises and weighs on the overall economy. ""Political inaction has already had economic consequences, with many firms hitting the brakes on investment and recruitment decisions,"" Adam Marshall, the BCC's director general, said. ""Worse still, some companies have moved investment and growth plans as part of their contingency preparations. Some of this investment may never come back to the UK."" Many financial firms have set up operations in other EU countries and carmakers have reduced their expansion plans in Britain. BMW said this month it could move some output in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In 2018, business investment fell in each of the four calendar quarters, the longest such run since the global financial crisis, official figures have shown. Finance minister Philip Hammond says he expects a pickup in investment by companies once a Brexit deal is done. But the BCC said that the diversion of resources to prepare for the risk of a no-deal Brexit and the high up-front costs of doing business in Britain, as well as questions over Britain's future ties to the EU, would limit any quick investment rebound. The BCC said business investment was expected to grow by 0.6 per cent in 2020 and 1.1 per cent in 2021. It lowered its overall growth forecast for Britain's economy to 1.2 per cent in 2019 - in line with the Bank of England's latest forecast - from a previous estimate of 1.3 per cent. That would be the economy's weakest growth in a decade, reflecting a slowdown in the global economy as well as Brexit. The BCC saw only a weak pickup, with growth edging up to 1.3 and 1.4 per cent in 2020 and 2021. It said its forecasts assumed that Britain would avoid a disorderly exit from the EU. ""A messy and disorderly exit from the EU would do real and lasting damage to the UK's economic prospects,"" Marshall said. Prime Minister Theresa May expected to ask lawmakers once again to back her Brexit plan this week after they rejected it twice previously. Also on Monday, property website Rightmove said the asking price of homes put up for sale rose by a monthly 0.4 per cent in the four weeks to March 9, the weakest increase for that period since 2011.

Close to 300 Bay Area residents, almost all of them Singaporeans, gathered at a reception in San Francisco on Friday to meet the ministers. The Bay Area has the largest community of Singaporeans of any region in the United States. Singapore Connect, a social group for Singaporeans in the Bay Area, has around 1,000 members, its president Mark Sin said. The reception was hosted by the Overseas Singaporean Unit and Singapore consulate in San Francisco. Dr Balakrishnan is visiting California in his capacity as Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative. Mr Heng is on a trip that began in Washington DC with meetings with finance chiefs of G-20 countries, and with International Monetary Fund and World Bank officials, as well as US Treasury officials, senators and members of Congress. In San Francisco, Mr Heng addressed the Bridge Forum CEO Summit last Wednesday. Both he and Dr Balakrishnan were due to address more than 800 tech professionals at a tech forum yesterday. Dr Balakrishnan told the gathering, which included families, that he and Mr Heng held a series of meetings, including with professors at Stanford University and venture capitalists, business people, and active and former politicians. He said he felt ""incredibly humbled by the fact that a country so small, just 700 sq km, a population of only 51/2 million of which we have about 3.4 million citizens, a city state that is 8,000 miles away from here, is so over-represented in Silicon Valley"". ""We have at least 1,200 Singaporeans working in Silicon Valley. And that is amazing when you consider that this place... is the capital of the digital revolution,"" he said.

Mr Heng highlighted the advantages Singaporeans have in growing up in a multiracial, multi-cultural society, which gave them cross-cultural understanding, confidence and the ability to adapt. The all-day tech forum is being organised by the Singapore Economic Development Board, Infocomm Media Development Authority, Overseas Singaporean Unit, SGInnovate and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group.

""What struck me is the speed and scale at which they are taking this challenge very seriously. It's an area we must invest a lot of time and resources in."" A second strength was the diversity of the teams the tech companies had assembled, he said. They have been able to assemble very diverse teams of people not just in terms of race, gender and age, but more importantly, in terms of their background experience, he said.

That is another major area we need to look at - how we can grow this talent pool,"" he said. Mr Heng also spoke about how the Government can create an enabling environment to allow innovation to flourish.

Government ready to steer Singapore economy through ups and downs: Heng Swee Keat,Apr 22 2019,"The Singapore economy will go through cycles and the Government is prepared for that, Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat told Singapore media in San Francisco on the sidelines of a tech forum on the last day of his 11-day trip to the US. ""If there is a need for us to use counter-cyclical monetary and fiscal policy to manage that, we will,"" he said last Saturday in answer to a question on whether there was concern over signs of a slowdown in the economy. ""But what is more important is for us to continue to focus on very major structural changes which are happening in the global economy and the Singapore economy.""

""What struck me is the speed and scale at which they are taking this challenge very seriously. It's an area we must invest a lot of time and resources in."" A second strength was the diversity of the teams the tech companies had assembled, Mr Heng said. ""They have been able to assemble great teams of people, very diverse teams, not just in terms of race, gender and age, but more importantly in terms of their background experience, whether it is the schools that they go to, the education that they have, the background training they have been in - whether it is engineering or businesses - as well as the range of countries that they come from."" By pulling together the background experiences, strong, diverse teams with very creative people have been built, he added. ""That is another major area we need to look at - how we can grow this talent pool."" Mr Heng also spoke about how the Government can create an enabling environment to allow innovation to flourish. He said Singapore was fortunate to have a single layer of government, which allows faster decision-making. ""But we need to look at how our regulatory approaches need to change in order to enable this innovation to take place,"" he added.

Sri Lanka explosions: Over 200 die in church and hotel blasts,Apr 22 2019,"Easter Sunday's calm was shattered in Sri Lanka by a series of coordinated explosions across different cities in the country that left at least 207 dead and hundreds of others injured. Just before 9am, blasts ripped through three churches, where worshippers had gathered for Easter mass, and high-end hotels in Colombo frequented by foreign travellers. Police said two of the attacks were carried out by suicide bombers. The authorities imposed a night-time curfew from 6pm local time last night (8.30pm Singapore time) to 6am local time. Access to major social media networks and messaging services, including Facebook and WhatsApp, was shut down, and there was heavy security at Colombo's airport, where travellers have been urged to report at least four hours before flight departures. Churches in Negombo, Batticaloa and Colombo were targeted during the Easter services. Pictures posted on social media of St Sebastian's Church in Negombo, located north of the country's capital, showed a shattered ceiling and bloodied pews. In Colombo, four hotels, including the Shangri-La, The Kingsbury and Cinnamon Grand, were targeted. An eighth blast occurred later at a house during a police raid. Latest reports say at least 35 foreign tourists were killed in the attacks, including Americans, Europeans, Japanese and Chinese. Agence France-Presse reported that the suicide bomber who had targeted the Cinnamon Grand Hotel had waited patiently in line for its buffet breakfast before setting off explosives strapped to his back. He had registered himself as ""Mohamed Azzam Mohamed"". Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attacks and the authorities have not attributed the blasts to any organisation. However, seven individuals were arrested in a police raid in Colombo later in the afternoon. Their identities have not been revealed. The bombings were the first major instance of terrorism in the country since the end of the civil war in May 2009 that saw the defeat of the separatist Tamil Tigers. There is growing concern in Sri Lanka that yesterday's events could exacerbate underlying tensions between different religious groups in a country that has witnessed several clashes in recent years between the Buddhist majority and Muslim as well as Christian minorities. Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera told reporters the attacks were a ""highly coordinated attempt at creating murder mayhem and anarchy in the country"", and urged people to ""unite with nerves of steel and defeat the heinous attempt to drag our country into the dark past"". In his tweet, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe also called upon Sri Lankans to remain united and strong. World leaders, including those from the United States, France, India, Britain and Singapore, have condemned the attacks. President Halimah Yacob expressed her condolences to the families of victims. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the Republic condemns the blasts, calling them ""senseless acts of violence"". Pope Francis in his address on Easter Sunday described the attacks as ""horrendous"", and expressed ""heartfelt closeness to the Christian community... and to all the victims of such a cruel act of violence"".

Sri Lanka explosions: Bomber queued at hotel buffet before unleashing chaos,Apr 22 2019,"COLOMBO • The suicide bomber waited patiently in a queue for the Easter Sunday breakfast buffet at Sri Lanka's Cinnamon Grand Hotel before setting off explosives strapped to his back. Carrying a plate, the man, who had registered at the hotel the night before as Mohamed Azzam Mohamed, was just about to be served when he set off the devastating blast in the packed restaurant, a manager at the hotel said. ""There was utter chaos,"" said the manager, who spoke to Agence France-Presse (AFP) on condition of anonymity as he was not allowed to speak for the company. The account is one of many from eyewitnesses to the carnage caused by the apparently highly coordinated attacks on hotels and churches on what initially seemed to be a peaceful Easter Sunday. The Cinnamon Grand's Taprobane restaurant was having one of its busiest days of the year for the Easter holiday weekend. ""It was 8.30am and it was busy. It was families,"" the manager told AFP. ""He came up to the top of the queue and set off the blast,"" he added. ""One of our managers who was welcoming guests was among those killed instantly."" The bomber also died. Parts of his body were found intact by police and taken away. ""About 20 people were seriously wounded and we sent them to the National Hospital,"" the Cinnamon Grand manager said. At the Shangri-La, eyewitnesses said they heard two loud blasts and staff reported some people had been killed. But details of the toll were not immediately available. A tourist told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Online that she was eating at the second-floor restaurant of the Shangri-La Hotel when two blasts hit about 10 seconds apart. She said the area had been full of visitors, including children. ""There was just screaming, and everywhere I looked there was blood,"" she said. ""Everyone was just hiding, trying to work out what had just happened and what was going to happen and we just didn't know."" The Shangri-La said in a statement that the bomb hit at approximately 9am local time (11.30am Singapore time) at its Table One restaurant but did not give further details. A huge blast also tore through St Anthony's Shrine in Colombo at around the same time.  showed fire and black smoke billowing from the church building. Motorists were shown driving away from the church, with some vehicles going against traffic trying to flee. Witnesses said many people died inside the church. Shopkeeper N.A. Sumanapala told The New York Times that he ran inside the building to help. ""It was a river of blood,"" he said. ""The priest came out and he was covered in blood and he seemed to be covered in someone else's skin."" At least 160 people injured in the St Anthony's blast had been admitted to the National Hospital by mid-morning, an official told AFP. Amid the violence, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera praised people queueing up to give blood, calling it a show of solidarity.","{'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.872, 'pos': 0.057, 'compound': -0.8817}",-0.8817
Keen foreign interest in Beijing property,Apr 22 2019,"BEIJING • Foreign investors have been increasingly active in Beijing's property market this year, with their transactions projected to reach a record high in 2019, industry experts said. DTZ China's capital market department deputy managing director Liu Bing said: ""We see an increasing proportion of foreign investors participating in Beijing's property market this year, and we are expecting another round of brisk investment this year. This is mainly due to the appreciation of the dollar since last year and tightening financing channels for domestic players."" According to DTZ, foreign investors have reached 10 block deals valued at more than 25 billion yuan (S$5 billion) in Beijing's property market from the beginning of last year till the first quarter of this year. Statistics from JLL indicate that foreign investors continue to show interest in the market this year. As an example, Dinghao Electronics Plaza in Zhongguancun was purchased by a joint venture of the Partners Group, The Family Office, SDP Investments and The Carlyle Group for around nine billion yuan. JLL Beijing head of capital markets Michael Wang said: ""Given the strong presence of leading and fast-growing IT firms in the area, Zhongguancun remains a bright spot for investment opportunities in Beijing. ""Due to the lack of commercial leasing space in the IT-driven submarket, rapidly expanding companies are increasingly choosing to purchase entire buildings to meet large office requirements.""","{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': 0.9485}",0.9485
Marriott to build world's tallest modular hotel in New York,Apr 22 2019,"NEW YORK • The world's biggest hotel company is betting that factory-built guest rooms are a key to juicing revenue - and helping guests get a better night's sleep. Marriott International is laying plans for what it says will be the tallest modular hotel in the world, in Manhattan's NoMad neighbourhood. The hotel's 168 guest rooms will be assembled in a factory in Poland, shipped overseas and trucked into New York in the middle of the night, when the city streets can accommodate the oversized loads. The 26-storey AC Hotel is expected to open next year. Marriott wants the tower to serve as a beacon to developers, lenders and factory owners. ""Our goal is to move the industry,"" said Mr Eric Jacobs, chief development officer for Marriott's select-service and extended-stay brands in North America. ""Cost and time are really important to owners and developers. It's about speed to market, and any time we can move that needle, it's good for everybody."" Hotel companies, such as Marriott, would like to ramp up modular construction because it can help them open new properties faster, a key path to increasing revenue. The method saves time because builders can do site work while rooms are being built in the factory, Mr Jacobs said. Modular construction is not exactly new in the hotel world, but it is unusual enough to give many developers pause. Financing can be difficult to come by because the projects require more upfront expense than a traditional building, according to Mr Sanat Patel, managing partner at Avana Capital, which is providing a US$65 million (S$88 million) construction loan for the NoMad project. At the same time, manufacturing capacity is limited, and many of the existing factories are busy building hospitals, houses and student apartments, said Mr Tom Hardiman, executive director of the Modular Building Institute, a trade group. A shortage of construction labour that has led to longer development times has made the factory-built model especially appealing. Marriott has been offering financial incentives for modular projects and connecting developers with architects, contractors and lenders in a bid to spur the effort on. The AC Hotel is being developed by Concord Hospitality on behalf of owner Robert Chun. Mr Jacobs said that within five years, modular construction could account for 25 per cent of all hotels in his pipeline, including North American outposts for brands such as Courtyard by Marriott and Fairfield Inn & Suites. The benefit for guests is that factory-built rooms are quieter. In traditional construction, a hotel room usually shares a wall with its neighbour, but modular designs typically call for an insulated gap between rooms. ""That means my collateral is really valuable, because it's done better,"" said Mr Patel.","{'neg': 0.018, 'neu': 0.927, 'pos': 0.055, 'compound': 0.9311}",0.9311
Top Democrats leave open option of Trump impeachment after Mueller report,Apr 22 2019,"WASHINGTON () - Top congressional Democrats left the door open on Sunday (April 21) to the impeachment of United States President Donald Trump, but said they would first need to complete their own investigations into whether he obstructed justice in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. Some party leaders have cautioned against impeachment just 18 months before the 2020 presidential election, although prominent liberals have demanded the start of proceedings to remove Mr Trump from office since the release of a redacted version of Mr Mueller's report last Thursday. US House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler, whose panel would spearhead any impeachment proceedings, said Democrats would press ahead with investigations of Mr Trump in Congress and ""see where the facts lead us"". ""Obstruction of justice, if proven, would be impeachable,"" Mr Nadler said on NBC's Meet the Press. The redacted version of Mr Mueller's long-awaited report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, the product of a 22-month-long investigation, outlined multiple instances where Mr Trump tried to thwart the probe. While it stopped short of concluding that Mr Trump had committed a crime, it did not exonerate him. Mr Mueller also noted that Congress has the power to address whether Mr Trump violated the law, and Democrats said it would be a matter of discussion in the coming weeks. ""That's going to be a very consequential decision and one I'm going to reserve judgment on until we have a chance to fully deliberate on it,"" House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff said on Fox News Sunday. Democrats in the House of Representatives planned a conference call for Monday afternoon to discuss their next steps in response to the Mueller report. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote to lawmakers last week to notify them of the call ""to discuss this grave matter"". Mr Nadler has issued a subpoena to the Justice Department to hand over the full, unredacted Mueller report and other relevant evidence by May 1, although the Justice Department called the request ""premature and unnecessary"". Before drawing any conclusions, Mr Nadler said Democrats would want to see those materials as well as hear from Mr Mueller and Attorney-General William Barr, who is scheduled to testify in early May. Mr Nadler also said he would call former White House counsel Donald McGahn to testify. Republicans have stood by Mr Trump, and Speaker Pelosi has cautioned against an impeachment effort that would have no chance of success in the Republican-led Senate. US Senator Elizabeth Warren became the first major contender for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination to call for the start of impeachment, saying last Friday that ""the severity of this misconduct"" demanded it. Mr Julian Castro, former housing secretary under president Barack Obama and another 2020 contender, joined Ms Warren in backing the launch of impeachment proceedings. Democratic House Oversight Committee chairman Elijah Cummings said on CBS television's Face The Nation that he could foresee possible impeachment proceedings against Mr Trump, ""but I'm not there yet"". He also said Congress needed to look at Mr Trump's finances and gauge Mr Mueller's intentions with his report. But even if Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic impeachment effort, Mr Cummings said: ""I think history would smile upon us for standing up for the Constitution."" Representative Tim Ryan, another Democratic presidential contender, said the party should wait until multiple ongoing investigations of Mr Trump in Congress have had a chance to uncover more evidence. ""Let the process play itself out,"" he said on CNN's State Of The Union programme. ""I would just rather us take this next step: educate the American people, really get these details out, let the Judiciary Committee do its work."" Mr Trump, who has repeatedly called the investigation a ""witch hunt"", has claimed vindication from Mr Mueller's report. Mr Rudy Giuliani, one of Mr Trump's lawyers, sought to undermine the credibility of Mr Mueller's investigators on NBC's Meet The Press. ""I don't think his people are fair,"" Mr Giuliani said of Mr Mueller's team. ""I don't think that report is fair."" While Mr Trump's team had indicated it would release a rebuttal to Mr Mueller's report, Mr Giuliani said that it was not imminent although it would probably be released at some point.","{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.854, 'pos': 0.101, 'compound': 0.9899}",0.9899
No fooling around as Ukraine comedian Volodymyr Zelensky takes on challenges of presidency,Apr 22 2019,"KIEV (AFP) - Ukraine's election has catapulted Volodymyr Zelensky, a 41-year-old stand-up comedian and television star with no political experience, into the nation's top job. As leader of a country dependent on international aid and battling separatists, Mr Zelensky will have to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, deep economic problems and possibly rebellious elites. Here is a look at the main challenges facing Ukraine's sixth president: Voters expect the new commander-in-chief to end a five-year war with Moscow-backed separatists in the industrial east. The conflict has claimed some 13,000 lives since 2014 and is a huge burden on the economy and society. Despite numerous attempts to staunch the bloodletting, the conflict regularly claims the lives of soldiers and civilians, and a solution is nowhere in sight. Mr Zelensky's rival, the incumbent Mr Petro Poroshenko, accused the comic of lacking the gravitas and stamina to stand up to Mr Putin. But analysts say Mr Zelensky could use his outsider status to strike a political deal with the Kremlin, which has said it does not want to deal with Mr Poroshenko. ""Zelensky will look for diplomatic solutions and try to avoid settling the conflict through military means,"" said Ukrainian political expert Mykola Davydyuk. In a major faux pas during last Friday's debate with Mr Poroshenko, Mr Zelensky called the separatists ""rebels"", sparking the military's anger. ""We do not have 'rebels',"" Ukraine's General Staff said on Twitter. ""We have Russian aggression."" Mr Zelensky said he would not resort to force to take back Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. After a popular uprising ousted a Kremlin-backed regime in 2014, the new Ukrainian government secured a US$17.5 billion (S$23.7 billion) deal led by the International Monetary Fund to buttress the struggling economy. But the disbursement of the funds has often been delayed, as Mr Poroshenko's government has struggled to push through reforms required by the IMF, including anti-corruption measures and raising household gas prices. Mr Zelensky said he will continue cooperating with the IMF and promised to do whatever is necessary to service the country's debt. Analysts warn that he is facing a huge challenge, as Ukraine's debt obligations peak in the next few years. ""In the next three years, Ukraine will have to pay off more than US$20 billion in state debt,"" said Mr Oleksandr Parashchiy, head of research at Concorde Capital, a Kiev-based investment bank. ""It's not exactly clear where the money would come from."" Economic growth is also slowing down, added Mr Parashchiy. ""He'll have to do something with that, too."" Mr Zelensky does not have a firm economic programme, though his team does include Mr Poroshenko's former finance minister, Mr Oleksandr Danylyuk. The young president will also have to rein in oligarchs who wield huge influence and prove to supporters he is not in the employ of tycoon Igor Kolomoysky, whose channel broadcasts his shows. Mr Zelensky will also have to demonstrate his ability to negotiate with various political forces to push through much-needed reforms. He does not have a proper political party of his own and will likely face huge resistance in Parliament, where Mr Poroshenko's faction has the most seats. ""It would be very hard for Zelensky to secure Parliament's support,"" said Mr Anatoliy Oktysyuk, an analyst with Democracy House, a Kiev-based think tank. ""He will have a hostile Parliament on his hands."" Parliamentary elections are set to take place in October. Mr Poroshenko and former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was knocked out of the presidential race during the first round of voting last month, may be looking for revenge during the legislative polls. Analyst Mr Davydyuk said assembling the right team will be crucial for the neophyte president. ""The main challenge for Zelensky is neither the army nor the war with Russia,"" he said. ""It is putting together a team: who will be his chief of staff, his deputies, who will fill the key positions."" Analysts say Ukrainians expect radical change quickly, so Mr Zelensky will have to move fast before he faces a possible legitimacy crisis.","{'neg': 0.093, 'neu': 0.845, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': -0.9678}",-0.9678

Sri Lanka explosions: Tourists flee and tour operators cancel trips as foreigners targeted in deadly attack,Apr 22 2019,"COLOMBO () - Tourists are scrambling to leave Sri Lanka and hotels are bracing for cancellations after  targeted foreigners and churchgoers. Holidaymakers are flocking to the main airport, cutting short their vacations in the wake of  , the worst violence since the end of a civil war a decade ago. Mr Kishu Gomes, chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, said he couldn't give an exact count of the number of people leaving, but it could run into the thousands. Tour operators in India, the biggest source market for visitors to Sri Lanka, are also cancelling trips for clients. That would hurt an industry that contributes almost 5 per cent to the economy. The foreigner death toll rose to 39 on Monday, including nationals from India, Portugal, Turkey, Britain and the United States. The authorities haven't revealed information on who may be responsible for the strikes. Top tourist spots, like the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, remained closed, while several of the bigger hotels in Colombo, such as the Taj Samudra and Ramada, erected barricades and were checking vehicles entering the premises. The US, Canada and Britain cautioned citizens about travelling to Sri Lanka, with Britain warning about the possibility of more attacks. Keep up with the latest in the region with the ST Asian Insider newsletter, delivered to your inbox every weekday By signing up, you agree to our   and  ""Even during 26 years of war, we did not experience a calamity like this,"" said Mr Hiran Cooray, chairman of Jetwing Symphony, the investment arm of Sri Lankan hotelier Jetwing. While there have been some cancellations so far, Mr Cooray said ""the tourism industry will come out of this"". The attack is a setback for the tourism industry, which has been an economic bright spot for the Indian Ocean island struggling to regain its footing following a three-decade civil conflict that ended in 2009 and political turmoil last year. Tourist arrivals have increased more than five times since the war ended. ""For the moment, our priorities are to take care of the injured, deceased and their families,"" said Mr Gomes, who is also head of the Sri Lanka Tourist Promotions Board. The authorities are contacting families of the victims and sending officials to hotels to check on guests. Sri Lanka was the top travel destination for 2019 in the Lonely Planet's annual rankings, with tourists attracted by its religious diversity, historic temples, rich wildlife, and growing surf scene. Mr Pronab Sarkar, president of the Indian Association of Tour Operators, predicted a ""knee-jerk reaction"" among all tourists and relief thereafter. ""Cancellations and change in plans will be visible for the next 15 days and then it should start reviving again,"" he said. ""The government can't afford to let that sink again,"" he said of Sri Lanka's rejuvenated tourism sector. Tourism authorities sprung into action on Sunday, seeking to minimise the damage to the industry. Tourism Minister John Amaratunga gathered industry leaders from the Hotels Association of Sri Lanka, Colombo City Hotels Association and Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators to discuss enhanced security measures, according to local newspaper Daily FT. Central bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said the tourism industry will take a knock, but it's still too early to quantify the effect on gross domestic product. Growth slowed to 1.8 per cent in the fourth quarter, the slowest pace since the start of 2014. The Sri Lankan people and the economy have ""demonstrated a great deal of resilience"", he said in an interview on Bloomberg Television on Monday. Most of the foreigners were killed at the Shangri-La, Kingsbury and Cinnamon Grand hotels in the capital, Colombo. The Shangri-La is a high-profile symbol of the nation's attempt to revive development in the country's capital. Hong Kong-based Shangri-La Asia opened the 500-room hotel in late 2017, an event that attracted both Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. It's part of One Galle Face, a 10 acre project near the Finance Ministry and other government offices that also includes residential, office and commercial space. The explosion took place at the Shangri-La's Table One restaurant, the hotel said in a statement. ""We are working closely with local authorities and emergency services to provide our fullest assistance and support to the affected staff and guests,"" it said. The hotel was struggling even before the attack. The occupancy rate was just 42 per cent last year, compared to the company's weighted average of 68 per cent. The two Shangri-La hotels in Sri Lanka were the company's worst performers last year, losing US$18.8 million (S$25.5 million), according to a 2018 final results announcement filed with Hong Kong's stock exchange last month. Tourism inflows have helped to ease foreign currency pressure in recent years. The government sold foreign bonds this year and extended an agreement with the International Monetary Fund on a US$1.5 billion loan to help boost buffers.

Malaysia reviving Bandar Malaysia project,Apr 20 2019,"Malaysia is reviving a multibillion-dollar property development project with a China-linked venture that was shelved by the former administration two years ago. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad yesterday announced that Bandar Malaysia - the 197ha former air force base on the southern fringes of Kuala Lumpur - will be reinstated, after it was ""abruptly terminated in May 2017"". The project, which will include offices, a park and 10,000 units of affordable homes, is expected to draw foreign direct investments and generate an expected gross development value of RM140 billion (S$46 billion). ""Like the ECRL, the Bandar Malaysia project should be viewed within the larger context of fostering and cementing long-term bilateral relations between Malaysia and China, while ensuring that such projects add maximum economic value to the country,"" the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement yesterday. The ECRL, or East Coast Rail Link, is another Malaysia-China venture that recently received the go-ahead after being suspended last year by the current administration. The 640km railway line connects ports on the west and east coasts of Peninsular Malaysia. Bandar Malaysia will resume with its original contractors - a Malaysia-China consortium consisting of Iskandar Waterfront Holdings and China Railway Engineering Corp (IWH-CREC) - but with a new development plan, said Tun Dr Mahathir. HARD LINE MALAYSIAN PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE, in a statement yesterday. Bandar Malaysia was launched as a business and transport hub project of state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) in 2011 by then Prime Minister Najib Razak. A stake in it was sold to master developer IWH-CREC in 2015 to help 1MDB with its finances, but the deal was called off in May 2017 over alleged missed payments. IWH-CREC had at the time disputed the allegations. Najib currently faces 42 charges of corruption, abuse of power, and money laundering involving funds linked to 1MDB. Under the new plan, IWH-CREC will make an advance payment of RM500 million - in addition to the original deposit sum of RM741 million - to be paid within 60 days from the date that the government officially reinstates the project. ""It should be stressed that the principle of integrity, accountability and transparency will remain paramount at all times. No corruption or any form of shady deals will be tolerated,"" said the Prime Minister's Office statement. ""This approach will prevent leakages, questionable dealings and abuse of power and will translate into massive savings for the government."" Reacting to the news yesterday, Najib called the move ""another big U-turn"" by Dr Mahathir's Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition. Najib said in a post on Facebook that the deal was the same one that was signed during his tenure. ""All the accusations that PH once threw at me and BN can be recycled back to PH,"" he said, referring to his former ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional. ""Selling the country. Shady project. Bowing to China."" Bandar Malaysia was slated to become the country's biggest transport hub, with the MRT line, KTM Komuter intercity trains and the airport's Express Rail Link line converging there.","{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.886, 'pos': 0.04, 'compound': -0.97}",-0.97

US liquor heiress pleads guilty in New York sex cult case,Apr 20 2019,"NEW YORK (AFP) - Clare Bronfman, heiress to the Seagram liquor fortune, pleaded guilty on Friday (April 19) to her role in a secretive society of women sex slaves. The guilty plea on two counts - conspiracy to conceal and harbour illegal aliens for financial gain and fraudulent use of identification - allows Bronfman to avoid a trial in the case set to open on May 7. Keith Raniere, 58, the founder of the purported self-help group Nxivm who has already been charged with sex trafficking and forced labour conspiracy, now stands alone as a defendant in a case.  is accused of creating a secret society called ""DOS"", a pyramid scheme of more than a dozen women ""slaves"" and ""masters"" with him - the sole man - at the top. Bronfman now faces up to 25 years in prison but the government's sentencing guidelines would see her incarcerated for up to just 27 months. Her sentencing hearing is set to take place on July 25. The 40-year-old philanthropist and former equestrian showjumper is the daughter of Edgar Bronfman, the late Canadian chairman of liquor giant Seagram whose net worth was estimated at US$2.6 billion (S$3.52 billion). Bronfman was accused of using her wealth to fund Nxivm to the tune of more than US$100 million. She was a member of the executive board of the group, which shot to notoriety for its initiation rites including the branding of its members with the founder's initials. The money is said to have financed court summons against presumed enemies, fake identities to access data and to help Raniere use the credit card of a dead former mistress. Besides Raniere, the five other people accused in the case have now all pleaded guilty. has pleaded guilty to racketeering and conspiracy for allegedly recruiting women to the purported mentorship group, whom US prosecutors say were forced to have sex with its leader.","{'neg': 0.169, 'neu': 0.777, 'pos': 0.054, 'compound': -0.9875}",-0.9875
"There is still a risk of no-deal Brexit despite delay, says EU chief Juncker",Apr 20 2019,"BRUSSELS () - There is a still a concern that Britain may leave the European Union without a deal to smooth the way, the bloc's chief executive said on Saturday (April 20), urging Britain to take advantage of a six-month delay to work out the details of its departure. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker made the comments in an interview with German newspaper FUNKE Mediengruppe, a week after EU leaders gave Britain six months more to exit the EU. ""Nobody knows how Brexit will end. This is creating great uncertainty. There is still a fear that there will be a hard Brexit without any withdrawal treaty arrangements,"" Juncker said, citing the long-term negative impact on Europe's economy. Even though the extension to Oct. 31 offers little clarity on when, how or even if Brexit will happen, Britain should use the time wisely, he said. ""I hope that the British will make use of this time and not waste it again. We cannot keep on putting off the withdrawal date indefinitely. The best solution would be for the British to adopt the Withdrawal Agreement during the extra time that has been agreed,"" Juncker said. The withdrawal deal negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May with the EU has been rejected three times by the British parliament. Juncker, who is scheduled to meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the G20 meeting in Osaka in June, predicted a ""lively discussion"" ahead. ""The last discussion lasted 6 hours and it is good that you were not there,"" Juncker said, referring to raised voices at his last talks with Trump. Trade relations between the United States and the EU have soured in recent months after Washington hit the bloc with tariffs and threatened more. Asked about possible new tariffs ahead of the G20 meeting, Juncker counselled patience. He called on Germany and other countries to spend more to boost growth in the bloc, which is expected to see a slowing economy, a day after German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz ruled out taking on new debt to stimulate his country's anaemic growth. ""However, Germany should use its financial leeway to further reduce public debt and boost investment. This also includes eliminating bureaucratic hurdles,"" Juncker said. He also cautioned there was a risk of foreign manipulation around next month's European Parliament elections where eurosceptic groups are expected to gain ground. With Britain expected to take part, the proportion of the assembly's seats held by eurosceptics is seen rising to 14.3 per cent from around 10 per cent currently, according to the compilation of national polls commissioned by the European Parliament.","{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.81, 'pos': 0.12, 'compound': 0.9771}",0.9771
Paris police clash with Yellow Vests as protests resume,Apr 21 2019,"PARIS • Paris police fired tear gas and arrested scores of protesters as the Yellow Vests began another Saturday of demonstrations with tens of thousands of police mobilised to maintain order. Dozens of black-hooded demonstrators threw rocks at police forces in the centre of the French capital, according to  TV footage. Trash cans and several scooters were also set ablaze. Police responded by firing tear gas and stun grenades. Some officers also marched towards demonstrators to control the crowd and funnel it to Paris' Place de la Republique, where they were authorised to demonstrate. Police headquarters reported 126 arrests and 11,000 checks on individual protesters. The so-called Yellow Vest protests erupted in mid-November originally over fuel price hikes and the high cost of living but spiralled into a broader movement against President Emmanuel Macron and his drive for economic reforms. The devastating fire last week at Notre-Dame Cathedral failed to dampen the 23rd straight Saturday of action, with key members of the movement saying that contesting Mr Macron's policies will not distract from grieving over damage to the iconic Gothic monument. Several demonstrators clearly alluded to the catastrophic fire, which prompted an outpouring of national sorrow and a rush by rich families and corporations to pledge around €1 billion (S$1.5 billion) for its reconstruction. ""Millions for Notre-Dame, what about for us, the poor?"" read a sign worn by a demonstrator. ""Everything for Notre-Dame, nothing for the miserables,"" read another sign that evoked Victor Hugo's well-known novel. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner warned last Friday that ""Black Bloc"" anarchists, who are blamed for the worst of the violent acts in recent weeks, were expected to join the Yellow Vests. The Paris police banned protests near the Champs Elysees and Notre-Dame. Protesters were marching yesterday from the French finance ministry on the banks of the Seine River to Place de la Republique in the city's centre. Large portions of the Paris metro network were closed and about 60,000 police were deployed across France, the authorities said. Mr Macron plans to hold a press conference on Thursday to outline tax and other measures he is proposing as a result of the ""Great Debate"", a two-month series of town-hall meetings he organised to let the French vent grievances raised by five months of protests. A speech planned for last Monday was cancelled because of the Notre-Dame fire.","{'neg': 0.179, 'neu': 0.75, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': -0.9935}",-0.9935

""We see an increasing proportion of foreign investors participating in Beijing's property market this year, and we are expecting another round of brisk investment this year,"" said Mr Liu Bing, deputy managing director of DTZ China's capital market department.

"Sri Lanka explosions: At least 207 killed, hundreds injured; 8 suspects arrested",Apr 21 2019,"COLOMBO (, AFP, , NYTIMES) - Eight devastating bomb blasts ripped through high-end hotels and churches holding Easter services in Sri Lanka on Sunday (April 21), killing at least 207 people and injuring 450, including dozens of foreigners. Police officials said that at least 35 foreigners were among the dead. A hospital source said American, British and Dutch citizens were among those killed in the six blasts. Sri Lanka's Defence Ministry ordered a night-time curfew with immediate effect, which was set to begin on Sunday night at 6pm local time (8.30pm Singapore time) and run until 6am local time (8.30am Singapore time), the ministry said. Government officials also said access to major social media networks and messaging services, including Facebook and WhatsApp, had been shut down to prevent misinformation and rumours. “The government has decided to block all social media platforms in order to prevent incorrect and wrong information being spread. This is only a temporary measure,” Mr Udaya R. Seneviratne, secretary to the president said in a statement. Eight people were arrested and three police officers were killed during a security forces raid on a house in the Sri Lankan capital several hours after the rash of attacks, some of which officials said were suicide bombs.                  Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said “so far the names that have come up are local”, but that investigators would look into whether the attackers had any “overseas links”. Keep up with the latest in the region with the ST Asian Insider newsletter, delivered to your inbox every weekday By signing up, you agree to our   and  Earlier in the day, Sri Lankan Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said the culprits behind the terrorist attacks had been identified and would soon be taken into custody.  ""Right now, the CID, the police and the military forces are investigating. We believe that all the culprits who have been involved in this unfortunate terrorist incident will be taken into custody as soon as possible. They have been identified,"" he said, according to the BBC.  ""We will take the necessary actions. We will go after them, whatever religious extremism they are following. We will take action against (them) and we will stop them from operating in this country in the near future,"" he added. Mr Wickremesinghe, who condemned the ""cowardly attacks"", called an emergency security council meeting to review the attacks, which seemed to have been coordinated. “I strongly condemn the cowardly attacks on our people today. I call upon all Sri Lankans during this tragic time to remain united and strong,” he said in a tweet. “Please avoid propagating unverified reports and speculation. The government is taking immediate steps to contain this situation.” President Maithripala Sirisena said in an address that he was shocked by the explosions, and appealed for calm. Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, writing on his verified Twitter account, said the attacks had killed “many innocent people” and appeared to be a “well-coordinated attempt to create murder, mayhem & anarchy”. The Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka said four Chinese nationals were injured, Xinhua news agency reported, adding that the nationals were in stable condition. The Dutch Foreign Minister said one of the country's citizens was among the dead, while US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said several Americans were among the casualties. Turkey's government said in state-run media that two Turkish citizens were among those killed. They were Serhan Narici and Yigit Cavus, engineers working on a project in Sri Lanka, Anadolu agency said, citing Turkey's ambassador to Sri Lanka and its foreign ministry.  “Unfortunately we lost our citizens...in the treacherous attacks in Sri Lanka,” Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in a statement. Cavusoglu said the ministry was in contact with their families and it would ensure that the funerals were held in Turkey shortly. Embassies in Colombo also warned their citizens to shelter in place, and Sri Lankan Airlines told customers to arrive at the airport four hours ahead of flights because of ramped-up security in the wake of the attacks. As ambulance sirens wailed across several different cities on Sunday, pews at the targeted churches lay in splinters. Soldiers shut down roads and Internet transmission slowed dramatically, possibly a government effort to stop the spread of fake news. Hundreds of people rushed to donate blood after a public appeal. Ten days before Sunday's bomb attacks, Sri Lanka's police chief made a nationwide alert that suicide bombers planned to hit “prominent churches”, according to the warning seen by AFP. Police chief Pujuth Jayasundara sent an   setting out the threat. “A foreign intelligence agency has reported that the NTJ (National Thowheeth Jama'ath) is planning to carry out suicide attacks targeting prominent churches as well as the Indian high commission in Colombo,” said the alert. The NTJ is a radical Muslim group in Sri Lanka that came to notice in 2018 when it was linked to the vandalisation of Buddhist statues.  A senior presidential aide said early investigations suggested that the attacks had been carried out by suicide bombers. The first explosions on Sunday were reported at St Anthony's Church in Colombo and St Sebastian's in the town of Negombo just outside the capital. At least 160 people injured in the St Anthony's blast had been admitted to the Colombo National Hospital by mid-morning, an official told AFP. Shortly after those blasts were reported, police confirmed that three high-end hotels in the capital had also been hit, along with a church in the town of Batticaloa, in the east of the country. An official at the Batticaloa hospital told AFP more than 300 people had been admitted with injuries following the blast there. Damage was seen at luxury hotels including the Shangri-La, Kingsbury and Cinnamon Grand. Bloomberg reported that police and emergency vehicles have blocked the entrance to the Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo, where there was visible damage, including shattered windows, above the main entrance where a cafe is located. At least one of the victims was killed in Colombo's Cinnamon Grand Hotel, near the prime minister's official residence, where the blast ripped through a restaurant, a hotel official told AFP. A tourist, who asked not to be named, told the ABC she was eating at the second-floor restaurant of the Shangri-La when there were two blasts about 10 seconds apart. ""There was just screaming and everywhere I looked there was blood,"" she said, adding that the area had been full of visitors, including children.  ""Everyone was just hiding, trying to work out what had just happened and what was going to happen, and we just didn't know."" Five-star Shangri-La Hotel released a statement on Sunday addressing the attacks, saying that it was ""deeply saddened and shocked"" by the incident. ""At approximately 9.05am local time, an explosion took place in Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo's Table One cafe - one of several locations in Colombo which were affected by this morning's attacks,"" the statement reads.  ""We are deeply saddened and shocked by the incident and our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the casualties and those who have been affected.  ""We are working closely with local authorities and emergency services to provide our fullest assistance and support to the affected staff and guests. ""Our immediate priority is to look after the safety and well-being of all involved. A Shangri-La crisis management team has been activated to provide all necessary support. ""As this is an active investigation, we are unable to comment further at this stage. We will provide an update once more information is available.""  At St Anthony's Church at Kochcikade in Colombo, a  source in the police bomb squad said“Our people are engaged in evacuating the casualties."" Photos circulating on social media showed that the roof of one church had been almost blown off in the blast. The floor was littered with a mixture of roof tiles, splintered wood and blood. Several people could be seen covered in blood, with some trying to help those with more serious injuries. The images could not immediately be verified. “It was a river of blood,” said Mr N.A. Sumanapala, a shopkeeper near the church who said he had run inside to help. “The priest came out and he was covered in blood and he seemed be covered in someone else's skin,'' he said. Sylvester, who was at the service at St Anthony's Shrine, told the BBC: ""I heard the explosion and then the roof fell on us. We took the children and ran out from the rear door."" ""But when I came to the hospital I saw my brother-in-law and son on the ground."" Visuals from            Bomb blast         😢 easter not Happy in Srilanka..        St Sebastian's Church at Katuwapitiya in Negombo posted pictures of destruction inside the church on its Facebook page, showing blood on pews and the floor, and requested help from the public. “A bomb attack to our church, please come and help if your family members are there,” read a post in English on the Facebook page of St Sebastian's Church. The panic of the blasts quickly spread to other churches, which halted or cancelled their Easter services. “Our phones were on silent, but one guy got a text about the bomb blast,” said Mr Ranil Thilkaratne, who was at a service in the Colombo suburb of Nugegoda. “Then he alerted the priest. We stopped the service and moved out.” There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the attacks in a country which was at war for decades with Tamil separatists until 2009. Bomb blasts in the capital were common during the conflict. There have been no attacks in Sri Lanka linked to foreign Islamist groups, despite local media reports that a 37-year-old Sri Lankan was killed in Syria in 2016 while fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group. Out of Sri Lanka's total population of around 22 million, 70 per cent are Buddhist, 12.6 per cent Hindu, 9.7 per cent Muslim, and 7.6 per cent Christian, according to the country's 2012 census. Only around 6 per cent of the population are Catholic, but the religion is seen as a unifying force because it includes people from both the minority Tamil and majority Sinhalese ethnic groups. Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the archbishop of Colombo, told local TV that the public should remain calm, and asked the authorities to bring those responsible for the attacks before the law. He also requested the public donate blood for the injured. Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam announced that all schools would be closed on Monday and Tuesday. In a tweet on Sunday, Mr Harsha de Silva, Minister for Economic Reform and Public Distribution, urged people to remain calm and stay indoors, adding that rescue operations were underway. ""Sec Defence and I am at Kochchikade church. Also was at ShangriLa n Kingsbury. PM is on his way from Bentota. Emergency meeting called in a few minutes. Rescue operations underway. Please stay calm and indoors. Many casualties including foreigners,"" his tweet read. Sec Defence and I am at Kochchikade church. Also was at ShangriLa n Kingsbury. PM is on his way from Bentota.

Mr de Silva later also urged people to refrain from sharing fake news and hate posts on social media, calling those who circulate photos of the victims ""despicable"". ""NO blast at Town Hall. Social media quoting @adaderana is not true. I don't think they have issued any such alert. People PLEASE be responsible in social media postings,"" he posted in another tweet. ""Sad how some have no respect for the dead. Why can't we not circulate photos of the dead? Also some are desperately working on creating racial disharmony. This is despicable. Please stop hate posts on social media. If not it will have to be stopped in the interest of peace.""

Trump sues to block US Congress subpoena for his financial records,Apr 22 2019,"WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - President Donald Trump on Monday (April 22) filed suit to keep US lawmakers from obtaining his financial records, the first salvo in what promises to be an escalating legal battle with Democrats in Congress. The suit seeks to block a subpoena issued by the Democratic chairman of the US House Oversight Committee for information about Trump's personal and business finances, alleging Democrats have launched ""all-out political war"" on Trump with subpoenas as their ""weapon of choice"". The committee's subpoena sought eight years of documents from Mazars USA, an accounting firm long used by Trump to prepare financial statements, related to its investigation of allegations Trump inflated or deflated financial statements for potentially improper purposes. Elijah Cummings, the House Oversight Committee chairman, issued the subpoena to the president's accountant after Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, testified to Congress in February that Trump had misrepresented his net worth. ""Chairman Cummings' subpoena is invalid and unenforceable because it has no legitimate legislative purpose,"" Trump's lawyers said in a filing, arguing it exceeded constitutional limits on the power of Congress to investigate. ""Its goal is to expose Plaintiffs' private financial information for the sake of exposure, with the hope that it will turn up something that Democrats can use as a political tool against the President now and in the 2020 election,"" they said. In a statement on Monday, Cummings said there was no valid legal basis to try to block the subpoena and accused the White House of ""unprecedented stonewalling"" in refusing to produce a single document or witness to the committee. ""This complaint reads more like political talking points than a reasoned legal brief, and it contains a litany of inaccurate information,"" Cummings said. The filing was the first effort by Trump's legal team to quash multiple investigations of Trump and his finances by Democratic-led committees in Congress. His lawyers made it clear they would resist those efforts. ""Democrats are using their new control of congressional committees to investigate every aspect of President Trump's personal finances, businesses, and even his family,"" Trump's lawyers said. ""Instead of working with the President to pass bipartisan legislation that would actually benefit Americans, Democrats are singularly obsessed with finding something they can use to damage the President politically,"" they said. The Trump Organization, the president's privately owned real estate company, is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit. Trump is suing in his individual capacity, and is represented by a private law firm rather than government lawyers from the USDepartment of Justice. Republicans on the Oversight Committee also had objected to the subpoena from Cummings, arguing it was an abuse of congressional authority to target the private financial information of Trump. Mazars chairman and chief executive Victor Wahba did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ross Garber, a Washington lawyer who focuses on political investigations, said the lawsuit might be dismissed because of the Speech or Debate Clause of the US Constitution, which offers broad legal protection to members of Congress for actions they undertake as legislators. But Garber also said there was some merit to Trump's argument that the subpoena was brought for the improper purpose of unearthing politically damaging information about him, rather than for a legitimate legislative purpose. ""Congressional authority is vast but it is not unlimited, and the complaint raises potentially legitimate questions,"" Garber said, adding that Congress would have a stronger basis for the request if it had initiated impeachment hearings, when courts have said its investigative powers are heightened. Garber said disputes between the White House and Congress over documents are often resolved through negotiation, rather than lawsuits, and that a compromise was still possible.","{'neg': 0.069, 'neu': 0.882, 'pos': 0.048, 'compound': -0.878}",-0.878
"Singapore finance ministers have never interfered in Temasek, GIC investment decisions: Heng",May 20 2019,"As finance minister, he has never once interfered in investment decisions taken by the national sovereign wealth funds, Temasek and GIC, as doing so would lead to him losing the authority of holding them accountable for their performance, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said in an interview with a Swiss newspaper published last Friday.Fabian Koh Mr Heng told Neue Zurcher Zeitung (NZZ) that his predecessors also did not interfere in what countries or sectors to invest in. ""Because if I do that, I lose the authority to hold them accountable for (their) performance,"" he said, noting that in his role as stated in Singapore's Constitution, he is held accountable to Parliament for how the funds perform. ""If the board and CEO are not doing a good job, I have the duty to remove them and to change, but I do not micromanage how they do it."" He said such an approach, and an openness to foreign investments, has led to multinational firms having the confidence to invest here. The minister was in Switzerland to attend the St Gallen Symposium, an annual conference bringing together young people, key decision-makers and thought leaders for discussions on economic, political and social issues. The interview with NZZ covered a broad range of topics from Singapore's housing system and the 99-year lease policy to similarities in Singapore and Switzerland's development models. SINGAPORE'S CHALLENGES NOW THE PEOPLE'S ACTION PARTY BEING IN POWER IN SINGAPORE AND THE NEED FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE Mr Heng was responding to a question on how the Singapore Government prevents crony capitalism from taking root, given that the People's Action Party (PAP) has been in power since independence. He said the PAP has regularly delivered on its promises to Singaporeans, and that is why it has won every election. The Government has held regular elections, which are always competitive, free and fair, he said. ""The fact that the ruling party has been able to win elections is not because we have been suppressing,"" he said. ""The fact is that we have delivered on what we promised, and that we have won the trust and confidence of Singaporeans."" Mr Heng said the Singapore Government does not claim to have answers to every problem. ""In fact, many of us, myself included, have been on record saying the Government cannot possibly have all the answers to all of the problems and that is why we have to mobilise our society to resolve many of these issues,"" he said. Explaining the 99-year lease policy, Mr Heng said home ownership is an important part of nation building, as a sense of togetherness is forged when people own their homes and feel they have a stake in the country.

Finance Ministers have never interfered in Temasek and GIC's investments: Heng Swee Keat,May 19 2019,"SINGAPORE - As Finance Minister, he has never once interfered in investment decisions taken by the national sovereign wealth funds, Temasek Holdings and GIC, as doing so would lose him the authority of holding them accountable for their performance, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said in an interview with a Swiss newspaper published Friday (May 17).Fabian Koh Mr Heng told Neue Zürcher Zeitung his predecessors also did not interfere in what countries or sectors to invest in. ""Because if I do that, I lose the authority to hold them accountable for (their) performance,"" he said, noting that his role as stated in Singapore's Constitution holds him accountable to Parliament for how the funds do. ""If the Board and CEO are not doing a good job, I have the duty to remove them and to change, but I do not micro-manage how they do it."" He said that such an approach, along with an openness to foreign investments, has led to multinational firms having the confidence to invest here. The DPM was in Switzerland  , an annual conference bringing together young people, key decision-makers and thought leaders from all around the world, for discussions on economic, political, and social issues. The interview with NZZ covered a broad range of topics, from Singapore's housing system and the 99-year lease policy, to the similarities in Singapore and Switzerland's development models. Mr Heng was responding to a question on how the Singapore government prevents crony capitalism from taking root here, given how the People's Action Party (PAP) has been in power since independence. He said the PAP has regularly delivered on its promises to Singaporeans, and that is why it has won every election. The government has held regular elections - the law states that each term of government cannot last over five years - which are always competitive, free and fair, said Mr Heng. ""The fact that the ruling party has been able to win elections is not because we have been suppressing,"" he said. ""The fact is that we have delivered on what we promised, and that we have won the trust and confidence of Singaporeans."" Mr Heng stressed, however, that the Singapore government does not claim to have the answers to every problem. ""In fact, many of us, myself included, have been on record saying that the government cannot possibly have all the answers to all of the problems and that is why we have to mobilise our society to resolve many of these issues,"" he said. Explaining the 99-year lease policy, Mr Heng said home ownership is an important part of nation building, as a sense of togetherness is forged when people own their homes, and feel they have a stake in the country. The 99-year lease policy is ""rational"" if one believes, or hopes that Singapore will last forever. With the whole of the island just over 700 sq km in size, there is a need to renew its land assets. ""If we sell land as freehold and that the moment you own it, you own in perpetuity, what it means is that children who are born in the future will never have any home or be able to buy anything,"" said Mr Heng.

Malaysia govt seeks repayment of $82.4m from company in cows-and-condos scandal,May 20 2019,"KUALA LUMPUR - The Malaysian government is seeking repayment of more than RM250 million (S$82.4 million) lent out to private company National Feedlot Corp (NFC), Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said on Monday (May 20). His statement recalled a huge scandal that broke out in 2011 when Umno-led Barisan Nasional (BN) was in power, that led to the stepping down of a woman minister whose family is linked to the project to rear cattle. NFC received the loan in 2008, with the funds to be used to grow the local beef market by rearing cattle locally so as to reduce import bills. The company is controlled by the family of former Umno minister Shahrizat Jalil, who was Umno's Women wing's chief. The matter later became widely known as the  , when it was reported that the funds were allegedly used to buy condominiums in Singapore and Malaysia, and to open fine-dining restaurants in Singapore. Mr Lim said in a statement on Monday that the sum owed by NFC is just over RM253 million which includes interest and late interest charges as of April 30. ""The Ministry of Finance has decided to seek full repayment of the loan to NFCorp and this matter was referred to the Attorney General's Chambers on Aug 29, 2018 for further action,"" Mr Lim said, as quoted by The Star newspaper. Keep up with the latest in the region with the ST Asian Insider newsletter, delivered to your inbox every weekday By signing up, you agree to our   and  ""The Attorney General's Chambers is currently looking into the matter and will announce the latest development when available,"" he added. The move is the latest by the year-old Pakatan Harapan government to seek redress in past scandals involving the BN government. Both former premier Najib Razak, his former deputy Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, several former ministers and former senior government officials have been hauled to court to answer charges of corruption, abuse of power and money laundering. The court cases included those linked to state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and its subsidiary SRC International, land development authorities Felda and Felcra, pilgrims fund Tabung Haji, and dubious land swops involving Ministry of Defence assets. Finance Minister Lim said a search conducted with the Registrar of Companies last Friday showed Datuk Seri Shahrizat's husband Datuk Mohamad Salleh Ismail was listed as sole director of NFC along with two company secretaries. This is different from information gleaned from a due diligence report by accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Mr Lim added, as reported by The Star. In the PwC report, it showed that Mr Mohamad Salleh and his children - Izran Salleh, Izmir Salleh and Izzana Salleh - as well as representatives from the federal and state governments were the NFC board of directors between Dec 6, 2007 and Dec 31, 2011. The scandal broke out in 2011 after Malaysia's Auditor-General's annual report's highlighted that NFC was poorly managed and managed to meet just 41.1 per cent of its target for 2010, and calling the company ""a mess"". In March 2012, at the height of the cows-and-condos scandal, Ms Shahrizat stepped down as Women, Family and Community Development Minister, but retained her post as Umno Women wing's chief. She said then: ""I have nothing to do with NFC. I just happened to be married to the chairman. I've been in politics a long time, and it is the right thing to do."" Ms Shahrizat, now 65, was not picked by BN to run as a candidate in the 2014 and 2018 general elections, and   after her coalition lost power in May last year. In April, Malaysia's Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Minister Salahuddin Ayub said a private company has indicated interest in taking over NFC. Mr Mohamad Salleh said in a statement reported by Malay Mail online news on Monday that there is a new buyer for NFC that will fully repay all outstanding loans, and the government has been informed of the plan. He said NFC's new buyer “has already agreed to undertake full responsibility of the liabilities"" of the initial loan amount ""and is prepared to make a ‘Full Redemption' full payment towards the actual outstanding loan amount to the government"".","{'neg': 0.076, 'neu': 0.875, 'pos': 0.049, 'compound': -0.9712}",-0.9712
US billionaire Robert Smith to pay off student loans of Morehouse College class of 2019,May 20 2019,"NEW YORK (NYTIMES) - Not even Morehouse College administrators knew the announcement was coming. Addressing the college's class of 2019, Robert F. Smith, a man who is richer than Oprah Winfrey, made a grand gesture straight out of the television mogul's playbook. ""My family is going to create a grant to eliminate your student loans,"" he said on Sunday (May 19) morning, bringing the approximately 400 students in caps and gowns to their feet. ""This is my class,"" he said. In January, Smith, a billionaire, donated US$1.5 million (S$2.06 million) to the college to fund student scholarships and a new park on campus. He received an honorary degree at the graduation on Sunday. The value of the new gift is unclear because of the varying amounts the students owe, but the money will be disbursed through Morehouse College and will apply to ""loans students directly have for their college education,"" a representative for Smith said. Because Morehouse was not informed of Smith's plans before the ceremony, details about how the money would be distributed were not immediately available. A private equity titan, Smith founded Vista Equity Partners in 2000. After making a fortune in software, he was named the nation's richest African American by Forbes. According to that financial magazine, Smith's estimated net worth is US$5 billion, making him richer than Winfrey, who previously held the title of the wealthiest black person. Smith studied chemical engineering at Cornell University and finance and marketing at Columbia Business School. Although he shunned the spotlight for many years, Smith has recently embraced a more public role, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and making major charitable contributions. Cornell named its chemical and biomolecular engineering school for him after he announced a US$50 million gift, and he has made major donations to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. He started the Fund II Foundation, which is focused in part on preserving African American history and culture, and signed the Giving Pledge, a campaign through which wealthy individuals and families commit more than half their wealth to charitable causes, either during their lifetimes or in their wills. Anand Giridharadas, the author of ""Winners Take All"" and a frequent critic of big philanthropy, said Smith's offer was ""generous."" But, he added, ""a gift like this can make people believe that billionaires are taking care of our problems, and distract us from the ways in which others in finance are working to cause problems like student debt or the subprime crisis on an epically greater scale."" Sunday's announcement came amid growing calls to address the crushing burden of student loan debt in the United States, which has more than doubled in the past decade. Over the past 20 years, average tuition and fees at private four-year colleges rose 58%, after accounting for inflation, while tuition at four-year public colleges increased even more, by over 100 per cent, according to research from the College Board. According to federal data, the average federal student loan debt is US$32,000. The standard repayment plan for federal student loans is up to 10 years, but most students, according to research, take far longer than that to pay off their balances. For the students at Morehouse, an all-male, historically black college in Atlanta that costs about US$48,500 per year to attend, the gift could be transformative, especially in the unsettled years after graduation. In an interview with the The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Elijah Dormeus, a 22-year-old business administration major carrying US$90,000 in student debt, said: ""If I could do a backflip, I would. I am deeply ecstatic."" Smith's prepared speech did not include his plan to pay off the students' debts. ""Now, I know my class, who will make sure they pay this forward,"" Smith said Sunday morning.","{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.136, 'compound': 0.9928}",0.9928

Britain's May offers 'new deal' to try to break Brexit deadlock,May 21 2019,"LONDON () – British Prime Minister Theresa May set out on Tuesday (May 21) a “new deal” for Britain's departure from the European Union, offering sweeteners to opposition parties in her fourth attempt to break Three years since Britain voted to leave the EU and almost two months after the planned departure date, May is mounting a last bid to try to get the deeply divided parliament's backing for a divorce deal and leave office with some kind of legacy. The odds do not look good. Despite offering what she described as “significant further changes”, many lawmakers, hardened in their positions, have already decided not to vote next month for the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, legislation which implements the terms of Britain's departure. Speaking at the headquarters of PricewaterhouseCoopers, May appealed to lawmakers to get behind her deal, offering the prospect of a possible second referendum on the agreement and closer trading arrangements with the EU as incentives. “I say with conviction to every MP or every party: I have compromised, now I ask you to compromise,” she said. “We have been given a clear instruction by the people we are supposed to represent, so help me find a way to honour that instruction, move our country and our politics and build the better future that all of us want to see.” By offering the possibility of holding a second vote on her deal and a compromise on customs arrangements, May hopes to win over opposition Labour lawmakers, whose votes she needs to overcome resistance in her own Conservative Party. 
  But she has infuriated Brexit-supporting lawmakers, who have described a customs union with the EU as no Brexit at all. Simon Clarke, a Conservative lawmaker, said on Twitter he had backed her deal during its third failed attempt in parliament, “but this speech from the PM means there is no way I will support the Withdrawal Agreement Bill”. “So if we pass the Withdrawal Agreement Bill at 2nd reading, we allow a Remain Parliament to insist upon a 2nd referendum and a Customs Union? This is outrageous,” he said. May's movement towards what many describe as the “Remain” lawmakers, who want to stay in the EU, is a shift for a prime minister who has long said she is against a second referendum and staying in a customs union with the bloc. She may be counting on the fact that parliament has yet to vote in favour of a second referendum and that a “temporary” customs union might just be weak enough for some in her party to accept. But it signals how her earlier strategy, to keep Brexit supporters on board, has failed and the last-ditch attempt to get Labour on board, some lawmakers say, is simply too little, too late. Earlier, John McDonnell, Labour's finance policy chief, cast doubt on whether it could win the party's support, saying what he had seen so far “doesn't inspire confidence, and I don't think that many of our members will be inspired by it”. Brexit-supporting Conservatives were equally unconvinced. David Jones, a former minister, described the speech as “unacceptable” and predicted that the move just before Thursday's elections to the European Parliament would only buoy support for veteran eurosceptic Nigel Farage's Brexit Party. “I believe more Conservatives will vote against it,” he told . “Regrettably, it will probably also boost the Brexit Party vote on Thursday.” May wants to get her withdrawal deal, agreed with the EU last November, through parliament so she can leave office, as promised, having at least finalised the first part of Britain's departure and prevented a “no deal” Brexit, an abrupt departure that many businesses fear will create an economic shock. Finance minister, Philip Hammond, rammed the point home in parliament on Tuesday when he said a no-deal Brexit would leave Britain poorer. He is expected to send the same message to business leaders in a speech later in the day. “The 2016 Leave campaign was clear that we would leave with a deal,” he will say, according to advance extracts.","{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.798, 'pos': 0.138, 'compound': 0.9931}",0.9931

India election winner gets an economy riddled with problems,May 20 2019,"NEW DELHI () - A set of deep-rooted economic challenges awaits India's new government after election results are announced May 23. Arresting an economic slowdown and nursing the nation's financial sector back to health will be the immediate priorities for the next administration   - as exit polls suggest - or his political opponents wrest power from him. A slowing global economy and a protracted trade war between the US and China add to the urgency to fix things at home. With 7 per cent expansion in the year through March, India has held the crown as the world's fastest-growing major economy. But that's quickly changing this year as consumption - which makes up 61 per cent of India's gross domestic product - weakens sharply, with ripple effects on new investments. GDP data due May 31 will probably show growth cooled in the three months through March from a six-quarter low of 6.6 per cent. Here's a look at what else the new government should be worried about: Going into the elections, both Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party and the main opposition Indian National Congress were big on pledges to spend billions of dollars to provide income support to the poor and farmers. Keeping that promise at a time when tax collections have undershot targets may come at the cost of India missing, yet again, its fiscal deficit target of 3.4 per cent of GDP for this year. Global credit rating companies are monitoring the number closely and any downgrade could push the nation's debt into junk category. The new government needs to find ways to productively employ about 1 million people entering the workforce every month. India hasn't published official employment data in more than two years, but a leaked statistics office report - which was rejected by the government - puts the unemployment rate at a 45-year high of 6.1 per cent. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt, a private research firm, estimates the jobless rate rose to 7.6 per cent in April. A series of defaults by beleaguered shadow financier Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd last year exposed fault lines among India's non-bank lenders, which accounted for a third of all new loans over the previous three years. While Modi's government's seized control of the company to contain the crisis, a lingering credit crunch has curbed loans and affected consumer spending. That's separately triggered concerns about mutual funds that hold debt issued by non-bank finance companies. India last posted a monthly trade surplus in March 2002. Rapid economic expansion since then has meant the nation's imports have far outgrown exports, with oil being the nation's biggest purchase. That's pushed the current-account deficit to more than 2 per cent of GDP last year, making it a key vulnerability for the economy. While India is trying to narrow the shortfall by reducing its reliance on imports and boosting exports, that will prove difficult in a global environment of slowing growth and rising trade protectionism. Fixed investments have been almost stagnant at about 30 per cent of GDP in the past four years, while foreign direct investment has declined recently - partly because of the uncertainty ahead of the election, but also due to politically-inspired protectionism and bureaucratic bottlenecks, which have kept investors away. India has missed out on the flow of FDI into regions like Southeast Asia as companies shift production to avoid rising tariffs in the US and China. A stable government with continuity in policy and progress on reforms could boost the sentiment.","{'neg': 0.099, 'neu': 0.844, 'pos': 0.058, 'compound': -0.9757}",-0.9757
India elections: Modi ready to form govt as shares hit record high,May 21 2019,"NEW DELHI • Indian shares hit a record high yesterday, a day after exit polls predicted a new term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) prepared to meet coalition partners to discuss a new government. While opposition parties refused to concede, most media polls said the BJP and its allies would secure enough seats to form a new government after the world's biggest election, which began on April 11 and ended on Sunday. Mr Modi's BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is projected to win anything between 339 and 365 seats in the 545-member Lower House of Parliament, with the Congress-led opposition alliance getting between 77 and 108 seats, an exit poll from India Today Axis showed on Sunday. A party needs 272 seats to command a majority. The predicted BJP margin of victory is wider than opinion polls indicated in the run-up to the vote, when most surveys showed the NDA would be the largest alliance but would fall short of an overall majority. Votes will be counted on Thursday and the results are likely to be out the same day. Indian stock markets and the rupee were sharply higher on expectation that the business-friendly Mr Modi would stay on at the helm. The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensex index had its biggest one-day gain in nearly six years - 3.75 per cent - to close at a record high of 39,352 points, while the rupee strengthened to 69.63 to the US dollar from last Friday's close of 70.22. The Prime Minister and other top BJP leaders made no immediate claim of victory. But BJP spokesman G.V.L. Narasimha Rao said the polls ""clearly show a huge positive vote for the leadership of Narendra Modi, who has served the country with unmatched dedication"". Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said he had confidence in the exit polls. ""When multiple exit polls convey the same message, the direction of the result broadly would be in consonance with the message,"" Mr Jaitley said in a blog post yesterday. Sources told  the BJP would hold talks this afternoon with coalition partners on forming a government at its headquarters in New Delhi. The talks will be led by the party's president, Mr Amit Shah, a party source said. Mr Nalin Kohli, a spokesman for the BJP, declined to comment. The BJP won 282 seats out of Parliament's 543 elected seats in its 2014 landslide win and together with its allies, it had 336 seats. The opposition Congress was predicted to double its 2014 tally of 44 seats - a historic low since India's independence in 1947 - but that the number would still fall far short of a claim to power. The party pointed to the unreliability of polls in previous elections. Congress spokesman Sanjay Jha said on Twitter he believed the exit poll numbers were wrong. ""If the exit poll figures are true, then my dog is a nuclear scientist,"" Mr Jha said, adding that he expected the next prime minister would come from outside the BJP alliance. Mr Modi and his BJP faced criticism in the run-up to the election over unemployment - in particular for failing to provide opportunities to young people entering the job market - and weak farm prices. But the Premier rallied his Hindu nationalist base and made national security a central theme of his campaign after a surge in tension with Pakistan in February following a suicide bomb attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir by Pakistan-based militants.","{'neg': 0.076, 'neu': 0.819, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': 0.9408}",0.9408

In January, the billionaire donated US$1.5 million (S$2 million) to the college to fund student scholarships and a new park on campus. He received an honorary degree at the graduation on Sunday. The value of the new gift is unclear because of the varying amounts the students owe, but the money will be disbursed through Morehouse College and will apply to ""loans students directly have for their college education"", a representative for Mr Smith said. A private equity titan, Mr Smith founded Vista Equity Partners in 2000. After making a fortune in software, he was named the richest African American in the US by Forbes. According to that financial magazine, Mr Smith's estimated net worth is US$5 billion, making him richer than Ms Winfrey, who previously held the title of the wealthiest black person. Mr Smith studied chemical engineering at Cornell University and finance and marketing at Columbia Business School. Although he shunned the spotlight for many years, Mr Smith has recently taken a more public role, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, and making major charitable contributions. Cornell named its chemical and biomolecular engineering school after him following his announcement of a US$50 million gift. Sunday's announcement came amid growing calls to address the crushing burden of student loan debt in the US, which has more than doubled in the past decade. Over the past 20 years, average tuition and fees at private four-year colleges rose 58 per cent, after accounting for inflation, while tuition at four-year public colleges increased even more, by over 100 per cent, College Board research shows. According to federal data, the average federal student loan debt is US$32,000.","{'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.85, 'pos': 0.11, 'compound': 0.97}",0.97
Money FM symposium to discuss manpower issues,May 21 2019,"Money FM 89.3 is holding a symposium on June 1 to discuss pressing issues in the manpower sector here. The half-day event will be hosted by senior producer and presenter Howie Lim, who hosts The Workday show on the business and personal finance radio station. The speakers include National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general and MP Patrick Tay, who will discuss the future of work and how the labour movement can help workers, especially older ones, adapt to changing demands at the workplace. ""It is imperative for businesses and workers to stay ready, relevant and resilient to keep pace with the changes and stay ahead,"" he said. ""We expect to see the convergence and transformation of job roles and therefore the need for workers to reskill, upskill and second-skill to become a Worker 4.0."" Fellow speaker Zainal Abidin Ahmad, senior vice-president of consultancy and training firm SSA Consulting Group, will talk about how the private sector can equip employees with workplace literacy skills. Headhunter Jaime Lim, who is country director of executive recruitment firm PeopleSearch, will discuss the expectations job seekers have and how developing future-ready skills can help them meet these expectations. Money FM's Ms Lim said she has gleaned insights into this area from interviews she conducted on the station's Career 360 segment. ""It was clear how technological advancements, the gig economy and Industry 4.0 were disrupting jobs,"" she added. ""Yet some I've spoken to seem blissfully unaware of the onslaught of change, while others are panic-stricken and desperately searching for courses to... stay relevant. ""This prompted us at Money FM to bring together a diverse group of speakers to make sense of what career disruption means for different individuals.""

Amazon-Deliveroo alliance would eat Uber for dinner,May 21 2019,"Amazon.com and British food delivery start-up Deliveroo are in some ways cosier bedfellows than Uber Technologies is with its own competing service, Uber Eats. The United States e-commerce giant led a US$575 million (S$791 million) financing round in London-based Deliveroo last Friday. One cannot help but wonder whether the investment is an amuse-bouche for a broader tie-up, a chance for Amazon to get a detailed look under the hood of Deliveroo's operations before evaluating an acquisition. There are a lot of reasons why that would make sense. The obvious one: Amazon wants a food delivery service. It shuttered the London operations of Amazon Restaurants last year amid a fierce price war with Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat. But there's merit in maintaining a presence in app-based food delivery services. Platforms in Latin America and India are already extending into products such as pharmaceuticals and groceries, and that approach could spread to other regions. That poses a threat to Amazon, not least because users tend to access food delivery apps more regularly, according to Mr Chris Caulkin, a venture capital investor with General Atlantic in London. The Deliveroo network of couriers must also appeal to Amazon. If you can ensure that the people making your deliveries have little or no downtime, they can make more money and are therefore less likely to go and work for a rival, since they are paid for each delivery they complete. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  If they are able to transport both goods from Amazon Prime Now, which promises deliveries within two hours, and Deliveroo meals, then the likelihood of downtime is reduced. Deliveroo's push into so-called ""dark kitchens"" might also help with Amazon's logistics. These are facilities that are not attached to a physical restaurant, often housed in shipping containers on sites dotted around London. While the model remains unproven, the idea is to reach more customers without the pricey overheads that come with an actual restaurant. Those locations could also act as last-mile fulfilment centres for Amazon, and Deliveroo plans to use many of the proceeds from the latest fund raising to open new sites. The brand cachet of Deliveroo, which tries to focus on convenience rather than fast food, aligns well with Amazon's goals: It appeals to a similar customer base as Whole Foods, the high-end health food store that Amazon acquired in 2017. The fresh influx of cash means that European food delivery price wars are likely to continue unabated, which is reflected in the share-price drop of rival services. The key difference between Amazon-Deliveroo and Uber-Uber Eats is that, on the whole, the people who deliver food for Uber Eats are not the same as the ones who ferry customers around for Uber. Though there is of course technological crossover in the systems that manage the two products, the operational crossover is more limited. That exposes Uber to high driver and deliverer churn, where they are more likely to jump to a rival that can guarantee more income. Nonetheless, it's sensible for Amazon to start with a venture capital investment in Deliveroo rather than an outright takeover, as it was reported that the two firms investigated last year. Already, the tie-up has sent a shudder among Europe's listed online food delivery companies. Just Eat shares slumped nearly 11 per cent last Friday, the biggest casualty of the news. Takeaway.com and Delivery Hero also slid on concerns that the move may lead to new competitive pressures. ""From the point of view of a business owner, we can't think of much more terrifying news than hearing Amazon is entering your backyard,"" said Mr Ameet Patel at Northern Trust Capital Markets. There's plenty of scepticism, not least from me, about how profitable food delivery can really be, and whether it can sustain its growth. Deliveroo made a loss of £184 million (S$323 million) on revenue of £277 million in 2017, the most recent year for which data is available. The business remains unproven, and concern about the path to profitability was a factor in Uber's disappointing initial public offering this month. An Amazon-Deliveroo tie-up could ease concerns about profitability. But it's also wise for the Seattle-based firm to test how viable it would be to team up before committing to an acquisition.","{'neg': 0.065, 'neu': 0.83, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': 0.9713}",0.9713
Australia faces challenge to curb China influence in politics,May 21 2019,"SYDNEY (NYTIMES) - In a gold-curtained meeting room in Sydney in March 2017, the Chinese consul general appealed to a closed-door gathering of about 100 people, all of them Australian residents and citizens of Chinese ancestry. He called on the group to help shape public opinion during a coming visit of China's Premier Li Keqiang, in part by reporting critics to the consulate. Rallies in support of China should be coordinated, he suggested, and large banners should be unfurled to block images of protests against Beijing. ""We are not troops, but this task is a bit like the nature of troops,"" said the diplomat, Mr Gu Xiaojie, according to a recording of the session in the consulate obtained by The New York Times and verified by a person who was in the room. ""This is a war,"" he added, ""with lots of battles."" The previously unreported meeting is an example of how the Chinese government directly - and often secretly - engages in political activity in Australia, making the nation a laboratory for testing how far it can go to steer debate and influence policy inside a democratic trade partner. It is a calculated campaign unlike any other Australia has faced - taking advantage of the nation's openness, growing ethnic Chinese population and economic ties to China - and it has provoked an uncomfortable debate about how Australia should respond. Many countries face the same challenge from China, an authoritarian power pushing its agenda inside and beyond its borders. In Asia,   to the campaigns of preferred candidates in Malaysia and Sri Lanka. In the United States, there is concern about Beijing's efforts to stifle dissent on college campuses. And in Europe, Chinese companies and organisations tied to the ruling Communist Party have held events for political leaders and donated millions of dollars to universities. Australian intelligence agencies have warned of Beijing's efforts, and the issue is likely to be contentious for Australia's conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who won a surprise victory in elections last Saturday (May 18). Representatives of the Chinese government routinely lobby Australian politicians without disclosing their activities, often by threatening economic punishment and persuading Australian business and academic leaders to deliver their message. The Chinese government and its supporters have also sought to suppress criticism and elevate its views in the Australian news media, by suing journalists and publishers for defamation, financing research institutes and using advertisers to put pressure on Chinese-language outlets. Beijing has even promoted political candidates in Australia with these outlets as well as via the United Front Work Department, the party's arm for dealing with overseas Chinese, and - according to some assessments - with campaign contributions made by proxies. Last year, after a scandal involving donors with ties to Beijing forced a senator to resign, Parliament approved an overhaul of espionage laws making it illegal to influence Australian politics for a foreign government. Australia's new government - led by Mr Morrison, who has been vague about his plans for foreign policy - must now decide what to do next at a time when the public is divided: Many Australians fear China but also favour good relations to maintain economic growth and regional stability. ""There is a lot to unravel with the China story here,"" said Mr Mark Harrison, a China scholar at the University of Tasmania. The Communist Party, he said, is essentially trying to enforce the same bargain with Australia that it has with the Chinese people: a promise of prosperity in exchange for obedience and censorship. China's economic bonds with Australia can be traced to the 19th century, when a gold rush drew Chinese immigrants to the continent. Now, China is an engine of economic growth for the country and its largest trading partner by far, accounting for 24 per cent of Australian imports and exports. With that reliance comes an implied threat: China can take its money elsewhere. The problem, current and former Australian officials say, is the Chinese government rarely discloses its lobbying activities. Australian businesses linked to China often lean on politicians without public scrutiny, leading security agencies to warn about Beijing manipulating politics. ""In no country is there such a profound rift between business community and security,"" said Ms Linda Jakobson, founding director of China Matters, a non-profit policy group based in Sydney. Critics say China has exploited that rift - and even tried to use its economic leverage to punish Australia for adopting the new law requiring those working on behalf of a ""foreign principal"" to register their activities. In June, Australian winemakers said they were facing problems with their exports to China, and a major deal to expand chilled beef exports into China - negotiated during Mr Li's visit - stalled. In January and February, China also delayed coal imports from Australia at some ports. Beijing denied any effort to punish Australia, and Australian politicians have brushed off these disputes. But it is hardly the first time Beijing blurred the lines between business and politics. In 2009, the Australian government rejected a bid by a Chinese state-owned firm to purchase 18 per cent of Rio Tinto, the Anglo-Australian mining giant, after officials argued privately that the sale would give China too much power to set prices. Beijing's response was an early version of what has since become common in the relationship: a campaign to pressure the Australian government via China's business partners. Chinese officials and investors ""put the weights on the relevant Australian executives"", Mr Kevin Rudd, the prime minister at the time, recalled in an interview. ""The whole idea at that stage was to maximise business lobby pressure on the government."" Analysts say Beijing tries both to suppress speech in Australia that undercuts its priorities - such as the diplomatic isolation of Taiwan - and to promote its own agenda. Critics say one prominent example is the Australia-China Relations Institute, a research organisation in Sydney led until recently by Mr Bob Carr, a former foreign minister and outspoken defender of China's positions. The institute was established with a gift from Mr Huang Xiangmo, a Chinese real estate developer who had donated generously to both of Australia's main political parties. Australia recently rejected his citizenship application and revoked his residency, despite his denials of having acted on behalf of the Communist Party. China has also had success shaping news coverage in Australia, especially in Chinese-language outlets. Ms Maree Ma, general manager of the company that owns Vision China Times, a newspaper in Sydney and Melbourne, said Chinese officials successfully pressured businesses in 2015 and 2016 to pull their ads because of its critical coverage. China's playbook prioritises one particular group: Australia's growing ethnic Chinese population, a diverse group of more than a million people, about half of whom are immigrants. At times, the Chinese government treats Australian citizens of Chinese ancestry as if they are still subject to its rule. Critics of Beijing are often pressured. In January, Yang Hengjun, an Australian writer and former Chinese official, was arrested on dubious charges of espionage while visiting China. More often, Beijing tries to woo people like Ms Yongbei Tang. Ms Tang moved to Australia 23 years ago with her husband, an electrical engineer, settling in Hobart, the capital of Tasmania, where she started editing a newspaper called Chinese News Tasmania. Last year, she ran for the City Council. ""All the people in the community know me,"" she said, when asked why. ""I'm a media person. Influential."" Ms Tang had also helped start a local chapter of the Australian Council for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China, which promulgates Beijing's position that Taiwan is part of China. The group was established by Mr Huang, the donor whose residency was revoked, and Australian intelligence officials say it is an arm of the party's overseas influence efforts. That connection and others made Ms Tang, an Australian citizen, a subject of intense debate during the campaign, which she lost. Several local Chinese leaders published an open letter condemning her ""hiding of titles of many organisations, including her association with the Chinese government."" Ms Cassy O'Connor, the leader of the local Greens Party, accused her of being part of an attempt by Beijing to dominate the Tasmanian tourism and property investment. ""The Chinese government actually picks off smaller states like Tasmania, with smaller economies,"" she said. Ms Tang denied any ties to the party. ""The only wrongdoing I did was to put my hand up, wishing to add a different voice to the Hobart City Council,"" she said. What Ms Tang actually illustrates, analysts say, is the party's ability to recruit sympathisers around the world, many of whom gravitate to Beijing's orbit less because of ideology than the potential for wealth and influence. Even after her loss, she received favourable coverage on state television in China. For many, Australian politics has become an increasingly valuable option - one of many ways to potentially benefit from Chinese power and prosperity.","{'neg': 0.099, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': 0.873}",0.873
Singapore's 2019 growth forecast downgraded to 1.5% to 2.5% after economy slows to 1.2% in Q1,May 21 2019,"SINGAPORE - Singapore's economic growth  in the first quarter of the year came in lower than officially estimated at 1.2 per cent - the slowest quarter growth in nearly a decade - as manufacturing shrank amid global trade tensions and an electronics slowdown.Seow Bei Yi This was lower than both the Ministry of Trade and Industry's (MTI) flash figure of 1.3 per cent growth and the 1.4 per cent expansion tipped by analysts polled by Bloomberg. It is also the smallest annual expansion for any quarter since April-June 2009, when gross domestic product shrank 1.2 per cent from a year earlier. In its Economic Survey of Singapore released on Tuesday (May 21), MTI also narrowed downwards its full-year growth forecast to 1.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent, from 1.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent, after ""taking into account the performance of the Singapore economy in the first quarter, as well as the weaker external demand outlook"". Global growth outlook for 2019 has weakened further since the last survey in February, and remains “clouded by uncertainties and downside risks”, said MTI. These factors include trade tensions between the United States and China, slower-than-expected growth in the Chinese economy and the delay in Brexit until Oct 31, resulting in prolonged economic uncertainty. Citibank economists Kit Wei Zheng and Ang Kai Wei  in a report said: “Although MTI's revised forecasts still incorporate recovery in the second half of the year, a full-blown trade war would dampen or delay the recovery, likely bringing growth to the lower half of the revised range.” On top of slowing growth in the first three months of 2019, economists noted there have been backward revisions to last year's figures as well, with DBS senior economist Irvin Seah flagging a “sharp downward adjustment in the fourth quarter”.  Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  In particular, he noted, quarter-on-quarter growth for the fourth quarter of 2018 has been revised to a 0.8 contraction, 2.2 percentage points lower than the 1.4 per cent reported previously.  “Just by that backward adjustment, it will lower my full-year forecast,” Mr Seah said, adding that such revisions are typically made earlier in the year.  On Singapore's first quarter performance, Ms Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC Bank, said an “unexpected drag came from services”, which saw its first quarter growth pared down to 1.5 per cent from 2.1 per cent in earlier estimates. The service sector, she said, is “the bulwark of the Singapore economy as far as jobs are concerned”, employing around two-thirds of the economy. Ms Ling added that it remains to be seen if the slowdown in services growth will be a temporary phenomenon or the start of a new trend.  “If services is going to crawl along at the range of 1 per cent or so, it's quite hard to see how we are going to get to the higher end of the revised 2.5 per cent range,” said Ms Ling.  “With the recent trade actions announced by the US and China, there is a risk of a further escalation of the trade conflicts between the US and its key trading partners, especially China,” said Permanent Secretary for Trade and Industry Gabriel Lim at a media briefing on Tuesday. “Should this happen and trigger a sharp fall in global business and consumer confidence, investments and consumption could decline, thereby adversely affecting global growth.” However, when asked if the recent moves of tech giants and chip makers clamping down on Chinese company Huawei – in the latest developments in US-China tensions – will impact Singapore in the coming quarters, Mr Lim said the MTI's outlook takes into account “a much broader suite of factors, beyond any single company or issue”. “The bigger issue we're worried about is how (US-China tensions affect) consumer confidence, business confidence, the uncertainty that will hang over the global economy... That's something we're keeping a very close watch on,” he said. Growth expectations have weakened for both the US and the euro zone economy as well, and China's economy is also expected to slow in 2019. Against this backdrop, manufacturing “is likely to see a sharp slowdown in growth following two years of robust expansion”, especially in the electronics and precision engineering clusters, said MTI. But it added that pockets of strength lie in prospects for the information and communications sector, construction, as well as the education, health and social services segment. Leading growth in the first quarter was the information and communications sector, which expanded by 6.6 per cent year on year, faster than the 5.0 per cent growth in the previous quarter. “Growth was driven by the IT and information services segment on account of firms' robust demand for IT and digital solutions,” said MTI. Meanwhile, the finance and insurance sector grew by 3.2 per cent and the construction sector grew by 2.9 per cent, a turnaround from the 1.2 per cent decline in the previous quarter and the first quarter of year-on-year growth after 10 consecutive quarters of contraction. The “other services industries” grew at a faster pace of 2.2 per cent year on year, compared with the 0.3 per cent growth in the previous quarter as well, primarily driven by an expansion in the education, health and social services segment on the back of a continued ramp-up of operations in healthcare facilities. However, the manufacturing sector contracted by 0.5 per cent year on year, a pullback from the 4.6 per cent growth in the previous quarter. This was due to output declines in precision engineering and electronics, in turn due to weak global semiconductor and semiconductor equipment demand.","{'neg': 0.069, 'neu': 0.847, 'pos': 0.084, 'compound': 0.9534}",0.9534
Powerstrip producer TrickleStar seeks Catalist listing,May 21 2019,"SINGAPORE - TrickleStar Limited, a producer of energy saving products, has lodged a preliminary prospectus for a planned initial public offering (IPO) on the Singapore Exchange's Catalist board. Details of the pricing, amount to be raised, and timing of the offering have not yet been announced. TrickleStar is primarily in the business of designing and supplying energy-saving products such as advanced powerstrips, load controllers, energy meters, energy monitors and surge protectors. These products are purchased by electric utilities, energy efficiency programmes, implementation contractors and energy auditors in the United States. The company is headquartered in Malaysia, which also serves as its corporate office, and has a sales office and main warehouse facilities in the US in order to serve customers in North America. Its manufacturing is outsourced to an independent contract manufacturer established in Taiwan, which operates its manufacturing facility in China. Based on the prospectus lodged on Friday, TrickleStar posted revenue of US$12.8 million for fiscal 2018. Net profit for the period was US$2.0 million, up from US$670,384 a year ago. Earnings per share stood at 2.94 US cents, from 1 US cent a year ago. In fiscal 2016, the company posted a net loss of US$258,498, with a loss per share of 0.39 US cent on revenue of US$9.0 million. Following the completion of the placement, the firm is planning a dividend payout ratio of no less thant 50 per cent of its consolidated net profit after tax, whether as an annual or interim dividend. This is excluding non-controlling interests, and non-recurring one-off and exceptional items. That being said, the intention to declare dividends is not yet legally binding and there is no assurance that dividends will be declared or paid in the future, said TrickleStar. Expected controlling stakeholders of the company after the placement are CircleBright Limited, which will hold 41.6 million shares in the company. Executive chairman and CEO Bernard Emby will hold 6.7 million shares in the company, and is further deemed interested in the 41.6 million shares held by CircleBright. Non-executive non-independent director Gunananthan A/L Nithyanantham, is also deemed interested in the stake held by CircleBright. To date, the company has an issued and paid-up share capital of S$6.2 million comprising 66.8 million shares, which will be increased following the placement, the prospectus said. In the next 12 months, the company is expecting a potential increase in raw materials and production costs in the short to middle term as a result of tariffs from the US-China trade tensions. It is also expecting operating expenses to rise from expenses related to the placement and listing. Proceeds from the IPO will be used to scale the firm's presence in markets it is operating in, expansion into new geographical markets and establishing new sales channels. It will also be used for product development; acquisitions of products, businesses and assets; as well as general working capital purposes. Key risks to business include a dependence on the continued service of its management team, key executives and employees - particularly Mr Emby and Mr N Gunananthan - who would be difficult to replace due to their combined expertise in the energy efficiency industry, the firm said. It is also reliant on a limited number of independent contract manufacturers, limited suppliers for certain key components and qualified professional staff to create and design its products. It may also be ""materially and adversely affected"" by any failure to maintain an effective quality control system on independent contract manufacturers and competition from industry players.","{'neg': 0.051, 'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.116, 'compound': 0.9859}",0.9859
India's Modi shows confidence as opposition dismisses ominous exit polls,May 21 2019,"NEW DELHI () - Political allies swathed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a victory garland on Tuesday (May 21), seeking to project confidence he would win a second straight term in a general election, but the opposition Congress party dismissed predictions it would lose. Exit polls have predicted a clear win for Mr Modi in the election that ended on Sunday, but such polls in India have proved misleading before, and counting of votes cast in the seven-phase contest will take place on Thursday. The result is expected later that day. The ruling coalition, led by   between 339 and 365 seats in the 545-member lower house of parliament with a Congress-led opposition alliance getting only 77 to 108, an exit poll from India Today Axis showed. Mr Modi met leaders from his ruling alliance, receiving garlands and shawls from them in a show of optimism. Flanked by BJP president Amit Shah, Mr Modi met cabinet ministers, party colleagues and dozens of the leaders from regional blocs that are part of the alliance. Seated before a sign reading ""Welcome and Thanksgiving Meeting"" at the BJP headquarters in New Delhi, Mr Modi was also given a metres-long, outsized garland. But Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the younger sister of party president Rahul Gandhi, urged party workers to ignore vote surveys, not lose heart, and to remain vigilant at vote-count centres. ""Don't let rumours and exit polls discourage you. This is being spread to break your determination,"" she said in an audio message late on Monday. ""This has further raised the need for you to remain alert. Please keep vigil outside strongrooms and counting centres. We are confident that our combined efforts will bear fruit,"" she said, referring to centres where electronic voting machines are kept. The Election Commission said it had received some complaints about attempts to tamper with voting machines in strongrooms, but they were not true. ""All such reports and allegations are absolutely false, and factually incorrect,"" it said in a statement. The two Gandhis are members of the latest generation of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty to aspire to govern India. The staggered general election, billed as the world's biggest democratic exercise with some 900 million eligible voters, began on April 11. Confident of victory, the BJP said the Congress party must think about whether the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty still enjoys the support of the people. The family has dominated politics since the British colonial rulers left in 1947, with three prime ministers. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, a senior BJP member who would likely retain his role in a new Modi cabinet, said Congress could no longer rely on the family to win votes. ""Leaders are judged on merit and not on caste or family names,"" Mr Jaitley said in a Facebook post. ""The prime minister's style of rising above caste and concentrating on performance related issues received far more acceptability with the electorate.""","{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.804, 'pos': 0.142, 'compound': 0.9938}",0.9938
Austrian President calls for Sept snap elections after coalition collapse over corruption scandal,May 19 2019,"VIENNA (, AFP) – Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen said Sunday (May 19)  he wanted snap elections to take place in September after the government collapsed over a corruption scandal. “My preference is for early elections in September, if possible the beginning of September,” Van der Bellen told journalists after holding talks with Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. The chancellor and president had discussed a date for an early parliamentary election and the makeup of a caretaker government, after a video sting brought down the leader of the far-right junior partners in the ruling coalition. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz pulled the plug on his coalition and called for a snap election after his deputy, the  , quit over a   in return for favours.                  Heinz-Christian Strache, who was filmed speaking to a woman who posed as the niece of a Russian oligarch, accepted that the video was “catastrophic” but denied having broken the law and said no money changed hand.  The scandal is a blow for one of Europe's most successful nationalist parties just a week before an election to the European parliament in which far-right groups anticipate record success across the continent.  Kurz, a conservative who formed a coalition with the Freedom Party a year and a half ago, said the apparent video sting was the last straw in the relationship. “After yesterday's video I honestly have to say – enough is enough,” he said in a statement to the media, listing various lesser scandals that had previously strained their relations. Kurz said he was proposing to President Alexander Van der Bellen that a snap election be held as soon as possible. Van der Bellen, who can dissolve Parliament, said he backed a snap election and would discuss next steps with Kurz on Sunday. “These are shameful images and no one should be ashamed for Austria,” he said of the video. “We need in this sense to rebuild confidence anew. This rebuilding can in this case only happen with a snap election.”  Austria could set an election date as soon as the summer, according to national law, “but that could be difficult due to school holidays,” said Robert Stein, who heads the election desk at the interior ministry.  “The first possible Sunday after the school holidays would be September 15,” he said.  The makeup of any caretaker government until the snap election was also up for discussion. The downfall of the Austrian coalition comes just a week before elections to the European Parliament and is a blow to one of the most successful of the anti-immigrant, nationalist parties that have surged across the continent in recent years. The Freedom Party is a major part of a new nationalist grouping that aims to score record gains in the European vote. The head of the opposition Social Democrats told broadcaster ORF she would not oppose a snap election if a Bill calling one were put to Parliament. As Strache announced around midday that he was stepping down, a crowd of thousands with left-wing placards and banners gathered on the square outside Kurz's office, chanting “Snap elections now!”. Police estimated their number at 5,000. Kurz had repeatedly distanced himself from his far right coalition partners over lesser scandals in the past, mostly involving party officials and anti-Semitism or racism – such as one in which the deputy mayor of Hitler's home town wrote a poem likening immigrants to rats. “For all these successes in the past two years I had to be ready to withstand a lot and also put up with a lot, from the rat poem to the proximity to radical right-wing groups and the‘isolated incidents' that kept coming back,” Kurz said. “There were many situations in which I found it very difficult to swallow all that.”  The video showed Strache meeting the woman in 2017, shortly before the election that brought him into government. Strache, whose party has a cooperation agreement with Russia's ruling United Russia party, described the sting as a“targeted political assassination” and said it never led to any money changing hands. He insisted the only crime that took place was illegally videotaping a private dinner party. He said he would be replaced as party leader by Transport Minister Norbert Hofer, his deputy, who narrowly lost a 2016 presidential election and is more popular than Strache. In the footage, Strache discussed rules on party financing and how to work around them, although he also insisted on having to act legally. “It was dumb, it was irresponsible and it was a mistake,” Strache told a news conference, fighting back tears as he asked his wife and others to forgive him. “In the cold light of day, my remarks were catastrophic and exceedingly embarrassing,” he said. He also apologised for flirting with the woman. ","{'neg': 0.089, 'neu': 0.779, 'pos': 0.132, 'compound': 0.9903}",0.9903

As its name suggests, the BRT combines the speed and reliability of the light rail transit (LRT) with the affordability of a conventional bus system, Mr Rudyanto Azhar, Irda's director of Iskandar Malaysia Bus Rapid Transit told The Sunday Times as he unveiled the latest plans on May 10. First conceptualised in the Transportation Blueprint for Iskandar Malaysia in 2009, the authorities are currently selecting consultants who will firm up the finer details of the design, among other things. Construction is poised to start in the first quarter of next year, with the BRT service targeted to commence in the first quarter of 2022, he said. The project, which will cost RM2.56 billion (S$846 million) and be financed by the government and private sector, is ""a fraction of the cost"" of building an LRT, said Mr Rudyanto. He disclosed that RM 1 billion will come from the federal government. ""It's been a long battle... Throughout our studies, we have looked at various alternative systems, and Bus Rapid Transit is the system of choice for the moment,"" he said. Keep up with the latest in the region with the ST Asian Insider newsletter, delivered to your inbox every weekday By signing up, you agree to our   and  When the BRT is ready, high-capacity buses will ply dedicated bus lanes on three main routes connecting downtown Johor Baru to industries and residential areas in Tebrau in the east, universities and small and medium-sized enterprises in Skudai in the north, and new growth areas in Nusajaya in the west. There will be 39 stations along the 51km-long trunk lines, including stops at Larkin, Bukit Chagar near the Causeway, and Medini near the Tuas Second Link. BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE MR RUDYANTO AZHAR, the Iskandar Regional Development Authority's director of Iskandar Malaysia Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), on how the BRT will benefit Johoreans who shuttle to Singapore to work. YEARNING FOR CHANGE MR IMRAN ABDUL HALIM, a sales assistant and Johor resident, on why he welcomes the BRT initiative. As an integrated public transport service, the BRT will also be supported by 42 suburban feeder services plying existing roads and 26 direct services to populated areas such as malls, hospitals and tourist spots like Legoland and Pasar Borong Pandan City. These air-conditioned buses with Wi-Fi on board will run on clean energy at regular intervals, slashing waiting and travelling times for commuters while reducing pollution and traffic jams. The BRT may be new in Malaysia, but not in the world. As of January this year, 170 cities have implemented BRT systems, serving more than 33 million people a day, according to Global BRT Data, an online database created and maintained by the World Resources Institute. In South-east Asia, the TransJakarta in the overcrowded Indonesian capital has been running since 2004, and the Bangkok BRT in Thailand's capital has been in service since 2010. In Vietnam, the first BRT was launched in Hanoi on the last day of 2016, but a plan to build a second route in Ho Chi Minh City has been scrapped due to high cost and low ridership estimates. Irda says Johor's BRT will be modelled after existing systems around the world, including Bogota in Colombia and various cities in China such as Guangzhou. The revamped bus network will cover 90 per cent of the sprawling Iskandar Malaysia, up from the current 39 per cent, Mr Rudyanto said. With better connectivity and accessibility, he hopes more people will use public transport. Less than 10 per cent of the region's two million population currently do so. He said: ""This will give people the impetus to leave their cars and motorbikes at home."" Johor residents welcomed the BRT initiative although some insisted they would stick to the convenience of driving to get around. Sales assistant Imran Abdul Halim, 26, said: ""I have been yearning for a sophisticated bus system that is orderly and goes directly to various locations."" He added: ""The current bus network in Johor is messy. ""The buses can be as late as by an hour, two hours, or don't come at all. It's so difficult."" The upcoming BRT is also aimed at easing massive traffic jams at the Causeway and accommodating the potential surge in commuter numbers from the future rail links connecting Malaysia to Singapore. Ms Kamisah Mohd Ghazali, Irda's senior vice-president of planning and compliance, told The Sunday Times there will be direct bus services from the BRT to the now-postponed rail projects, namely, the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail (HSR) railway and the Johor Baru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link. ""If we have RTS without BRT, then how do we disperse commuters. We need to get BRT on the ground, we must have it so that you have a system that caters for intra-Iskandar Malaysia that is reachable by 90 per cent of the populated areas,"" she said. The RTS project has been suspended for six months from April 1 this year and the HSR project, up till May 31 next year. But Irda officials were hopeful the RTS project will go ahead as an enduring solution to the perennial traffic jam at the border. ""The congestion on the Causeway has been like this for years. There must be a solution. After 30 years, we can't be living in the same conditions considering Iskandar Malaysia is moving towards becoming a strong and sustainable international metropolis,"" said Ms Kamisah. Mr Rudyanto said the BRT will benefit Johoreans who shuttle every day to Singapore to work. ""They can have better quality of living instead of having to wake up at 4 in the morning,"" he said. Singaporeans too would not need to drive or ride into Johor to shop, eat and relax. Those with businesses in Johor, or who wish to shift their operations there, could also travel more conveniently and cheaply.","{'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.91, 'pos': 0.074, 'compound': 0.9954}",0.9954
Austrian far-right leader quits over video,May 19 2019,"VIENNA • Austria's Vice-Chancellor and long-time far-right leader Heinz-Christian Strache yesterday said that he is stepping down over ""catastrophic"" video footage of him that has threatened to bring down the right-wing coalition government. The video shows Mr Strache, the Freedom Party (FPO) leader, meeting a woman posing as the niece of a Russian oligarch in 2017, shortly before the election that brought him to power. In the footage published by German media on Friday evening, a week before European Parliament elections, he appears to offer to funnel contracts towards a company in exchange for political and financial support. ""It was dumb, it was irresponsible and it was a mistake,"" Mr Strache told a news conference, fighting back tears as he asked his wife and others to forgive him. He maintained, however, that he had done nothing illegal and that the video was a ""targeted political assassination"". ""In the cold light of day, my remarks were catastrophic and exceedingly embarrassing,"" he said about the video, in which he also referred to party financing rules and how to work around them, but also insisted on having to act legally. There is much speculation over whether the damage would be limited to Mr Strache or if Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz would have to call a snap election only 11/2 years after the coalition between his conservatives and the FPO was formed. Mr Kurz has repeatedly distanced himself from the FPO over lesser scandals, mostly ones involving party officials and anti-Semitism or racism, to protect his popularity. It was unclear how far the damage from the tape would spread. ""This is the tip of the iceberg,"" Mr Thomas Drozda of the opposition Social Democrats told national broadcaster ORF. ""I expect the Chancellor, who evidently has known about this video for 48 hours, and that his coalition partner is drowning in a swamp of corruption, to speak and explain his position. He has been hiding for 48 hours... he owes the country an explanation."" Mr Strache, in an at-times rambling defence of his behaviour, also apologised for flirting with the woman, whom he describes as attractive in the recording. ""It was typical alcohol-fuelled macho behaviour in which, yes, I also wanted to impress the attractive female host and I behaved like a bragging teenager,"" he said. Mr Strache said he would be replaced by Transport Minister Norbert Hofer, his deputy within the party who narrowly lost the presidential election in 2016 and is more popular than Mr Strache. ""I do not in any circumstances want my wrong behaviour to provide a pretext for the government to collapse,"" Mr Strache said. Opposition parties including the Social Democrats, the liberal Neos party and the Greens have called for a snap election. A crowd of hundreds with left-wing placards and banners gathered on the square outside Mr Kurz's office, chanting ""Snap elections now!"" Mr Kurz's coalition options are limited. Although his party remains in the lead in opinion polls it is still well short of a majority. The only party other than the FPO with enough seats to form a majority is the Social Democrats, with which Mr Kurz has difficult relations.","{'neg': 0.084, 'neu': 0.791, 'pos': 0.125, 'compound': 0.9625}",0.9625
It Changed My Life: She gives up high-flying career and five-figure salary to pursue mindfulness,May 19 2019,"When Ms Angie Chew suffered breathing difficulties about 10 years ago, she thought she had lung cancer.Wong Kim Hoh ""My chest was always tight and painful, and I found it difficult to breathe for days on end,"" she recalls. Worried, she got her chest X-rayed and even went for an electrocardiogram. There was, however, nothing wrong with her lungs or heart. A doctor later told her she was suffering from anxiety attacks. The preceding couple of years had been rough. Caring for a mother who had dementia, and later coping with her death, took a big toll emotionally. Her marriage collapsed. Years of emotional bullying and work stress brought on by difficult bosses made matters worse. ""Many PMETs suffer in silence,"" the 55-year-old says, referring to professionals, managers, executives and technicians. ""Because I was high-functioning, people didn't know I was depressed."" Her instincts kicked in after her diagnosis. Instead of relying on medication, she turned to mindfulness to get out of her funk. Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention in the present moment in a non-judgmental way. Techniques to train the mind and strengthen the brain to focus in this manner include breath awareness and movement exercises. When she recovered, she took stock of her life. ""Instead of condemning the darkness, why not light a candle?"" she says. In 2012, she set up Brahm Centre, a secular outfit where people can go for health education as well as emotional and mental support. A couple of years later, she gave up her $20,000 monthly salary and took a 60 per cent pay cut to grow the charity. Today, there are three Brahm Centres, in Novena, Simei and MacPherson. A new 8,000 sq ft centre is scheduled to open in Tampines in December. From just three in the first year, it now employs 36 staff. The centre has also expanded its range of services to include helping, befriending, counselling and providing dementia screenings for the elderly who are frail and lonely. Besides grants and donations, the centre also conducts mindfulness courses for companies as well as agencies such as SingHealth, the Institute of Mental Health and the Ministry of Health. ""Many clinicians also refer their patients to us for mindfulness as the skill helps them to be much more aware of their emotions and thoughts, taking more responsibility for their physical and mental health, thus resulting in more effective treatments subsequently."" The mother of two children in their early 20s, Ms Chew speaks well with a calm, soothing voice. Although petite, she is more than capable of taking care of herself: She is a two-dan karate black-belter. Her late father is Chew Choo Soot, a grand master who founded Karate Budokan International in Malaysia and turned it into a worldwide organisation. Ms Chew, the youngest of four children, started karate training when she was five, and used to accompany him when he travelled the world to conduct training and grading for exponents. She remembers conducting a karate training session for 300 men when she was 15 in Tiruchi in India. ""With just one command, I moved 300 men,"" she recalls with a laugh. The exposure was tremendous. ""Dad never said, 'You're a girl. You can't do this or that',"" says Ms Chew. ""He taught me independence. My mother never worked a single day in her life and was totally dependent on him, and I told myself that unlike her, I must be financially independent."" Upon completing the Malaysian equivalent of the O levels in 1981, she left her home in Petaling Jaya in Selangor for the University of Iowa to do a pre-medicine programme. Her plans for medical school flew out the window when she signed up for a computer science module and found it exciting. ""I guess most of my life is accidental,"" says Ms Chew, who taught karate to earn credits and worked at several part-time jobs to help finance her degree. After graduating, she married a Singaporean student. Halfway through her master's in computer science in 1986, she returned with him to Singapore when they landed a contract to build a computer system to process claims and policies for an insurance company. They then started a successful software consulting company, Cognitive Design Systems; their clients included Citibank and Standard Chartered. The marriage did not work out, but the couple remained friends and continued working together until they sold their business to the EDS Group in the early 1990s. She then worked at some of the world's best-known organisations, including Accenture, Visa International, Singapore Airlines and Hewlett-Packard. Climbing the corporate ladder and raising two children from a new marriage did not stop her from doing volunteer work. Many Sundays were spent at Toa Payoh Girls' Home, where she counselled young girls from tumultuous backgrounds. ""I would also go to the Tai Pei Old People's Home, where I adopted my own elderly folks who didn't get many visits. I'd cut their nails and we'd talk about the same things every week. I didn't know about dementia then."" Life hummed along until her mother - who was living with her - was diagnosed with dementia in the late 2000s. The sickness changed her mother's personality. ""She was quite hurtful in her words and lost all her friends. Nobody knew at that time it was a disease in her brain."" Ms Chew put her mother in a home but was riddled with so much guilt she took her home not long after and cared for her until she died a year later in 2011. By then, her second marriage had collapsed and things were unravelling around her. Setting up Brahm Centre with $20,000 that she raised was her way of rewriting her life and how it should be lived. ""Looking after my mother made me realise how we often relied on other people to create happiness. We have to be responsible for our own happiness,"" she says. Although she was making $1,000 a day as a computer professional, she decided to fully devote her time to Brahm Centre after she met a 37-year-old woman whose cancer had relapsed. ""Before she died, I helped her and her parents to reconcile and forgive each other. I helped the parents accept that their daughter was going to die. The daughter wanted forgiveness from them for not being around in their old age and for not doing enough for them."" It was a turning point, she says. ""What if one day I was told that I would not have much time left? What would I regret most? And I decided it was not committing enough to the charity I founded,"" says Ms Chew, who qualified as a University of Massachusetts Medical School mindfulness-based stress reduction teacher in 2017. Besides conducting courses for corporations, she also teaches a graded module on mindfulness for students at the National University of Singapore. She donates her fees for the oversubscribed course to the charity. The Brahm Centre will be spearheading this year's Singapore Mindfulness Conference in August. It is expected to attract 1,000 participants. What Ms Chew does now involves long hours, even during weekends, but she is happy.","{'neg': 0.065, 'neu': 0.86, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': 0.7256}",0.7256
"In India, US-style political divides arrive",May 20 2019,"LUCKNOW, INDIA (WASHINGTON POST) - In their 31 years of marriage, Seema and Sanjive Khanna have fought many times, the way couples do, over the house or the children or their finances. But nothing has divided them as bitterly as Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the current Indian election. To Seema, Mr Modi can do no wrong, but to Sanjive, he has done nothing right. Sometimes, after they argue about Mr Modi, they don't speak to each other for hours. To keep the peace on their daily walks around the neighbourhood, they instituted an informal rule: no talking about politics. While such bitter political divisions are all too familiar in the United States, they are relatively new in India, the world's largest democracy.  (May 19), India's politics have increasingly mirrored the United States': Every issue is filtered through a partisan lens, social media is the scene of rancorous exchanges, and disagreements over politics have strained relationships. ""People had different opinions earlier as well, but the atmosphere was never so hostile,"" said Ms Niti Saxena, 47, a women's rights activist in Lucknow. ""This is not healthy."" And at the heart of the growing divide stands the towering figure of Mr Modi, who inspires either fervent loyalty or deep distrust, not unlike President Donald Trump in the United States. Mr Modi was elected in a landslide victory in 2014 and is seeking re-election. He leads the Bharatiya Janata Party, a centre-right political party built around Hindu nationalism, the idea that India - home to a diversity of religions - is fundamentally a Hindu nation, not a secular republic. The ugliness in living rooms and around dinner tables reflects the polarisation ""coming from the top"", said Professor Ashutosh Varshney, a political scientist at Brown University. Mr Modi's view of politics divides people into friends and enemies, he said. ""If you have that spirit, you will have bitterness instead of competitiveness,"" Prof Varshney said. ""There is no space for neutral conversation."" Research confirms that Indian politics is growing more polarised. A 2017 survey by the Pew Research Centre found there was a growing partisan gap between supporters of the BJP and the opposition India National Congress party when it came to their views of Mr Modi. Of course, there are differences between India, with its multitude of parties and parliamentary democracy, and the two-party system in the United States. Still, Mr Modi has worked to turn Indian elections into presidential-style contests, urging voters to focus on him rather than a party or representative in Parliament. ""Earlier it was about the parties, and this is about Modi,"" said Ms Ritu Priya, a programme manager for a German foundation in Delhi who has fought repeatedly with her father about politics. ""Sometimes you think it would be nice if you could have a meaningful conversation. You cannot. Everything will end up a disaster."" The growing polarisation was on full display on a recent weekend afternoon at the Khanna household in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, the country's biggest state. Just before lunchtime, Seema, 53, and Sanjive, 57, sat in their living room and chatted with their daughter and her husband. Talk veered to politics within seconds. ""You know that quote about not being able to fool all the people, all the time? Modi has proved it wrong,"" Sanjive said. At least Mr Modi is a strong leader, unlike his predecessor from the opposition Congress party, who was ""sitting with a lollipop"" doing nothing, Seema retorted. ""Modi's got spine."" Sanjive says that under Mr Modi, India's democracy has degenerated into dictatorship. Seema disagrees vehemently. When Sanjive calls Mr Modi a ""con artist"" and criticises him for abandoning his wife, Seema gets visibly upset. Their daughter Kareshma, who runs a pharmaceutical start-up and describes herself as apolitical, finds her parents' behaviour mystifying. ""I can't understand how they can fight like cats and dogs over politics,"" she said. In the new political environment, Indians have developed strategies for dealing with friends, family members and colleagues with differing views: Either stick with your own kind or avoid talking about Mr Modi altogether. At a recent wedding, Sanjive described being outnumbered by Modi supporters in the family. ""I consciously chose to sit with the few who shared my beliefs,"" he said. ""I didn't want the occasion to turn ugly."" This shrinking space for harmony is evident at dinner tables, too. In another leafy neighbourhood of Lucknow, the Singh family assembled on a recent evening at patriarch Chandra Bhal's house. A retired army officer, Mr Singh has admired only two Indian prime ministers in his lifetime - one is Mr Modi and the other is Mrs Indira Gandhi of the Congress Party, popularly dubbed the ""Iron Lady"" who helped liberate Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971. Mr Singh especially approved of Mr Modi's decision to launch an air strike on an alleged terrorist camp in Pakistan after an attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir in February. ""To survive in this world, you need a powerful leader. See, nobody messes with the United States or Russia,"" said Mr Singh. His daughter, Ms Niti Saxena, the women's rights activist, and granddaughter Shubhangi, 29, are outraged. They worry about the risk of war and accuse Mr Modi of politicising the army by asking for votes on the campaign trail in the name of the air strikes. ""It's shocking. It is as if Modi is the country!"" Shubhangi said. Voices rise, fingers are pointed, and people start talking over each other. Then, in deference to Mr Singh, Shubhangi and Niti fall silent. Someone says, ""Let's serve dinner."" Priya, the programme manager who lives in Delhi, said that the last time her parents came to visit a few months ago, her father and her elder brother got into a heated argument over politics that lasted several hours. Her father, a Modi enthusiast, told his children, both Modi detractors, that he felt ashamed of them. She said her father's views became more entrenched in recent years, ever since he retired and began consuming a steady diet of pro-Modi television channels and reading partisan forwarded messages on WhatsApp. But Priya added that the bitterness cuts both ways.","{'neg': 0.104, 'neu': 0.78, 'pos': 0.116, 'compound': 0.9555}",0.9555
Austria heads for polls after scandal ends coalition government,May 20 2019,"VIENNA • Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has ended his controversial coalition with the nationalist Freedom Party after a video compromised his junior partner. He is seeking an early election in September in a gamble that he can govern alone. Twenty-six hours after Austrian politics was turned upside down by the publication of secretly filmed footage showing his deputy promising government contracts in return for campaign funding, Mr Kurz said on Saturday evening that it had become impossible to continue with the nationalists. ""Enough is enough,"" he said. ""I want to work for our beautiful country, with the support of a majority of the people, but without incidents, accidents and scandals."" The collapse of the Austrian coalition is a massive defeat for one of the most successful populist parties on the continent just a week before European Parliament elections, in which nationalists want to strike a blow against the establishment. It is also a sign of Europe's political fragility as the decline of many mainstream parties makes coalition governments more unstable. Mr Heinz-Christian Strache stepped down as vice-chancellor and head of the Freedom Party on Saturday, calling his behaviour exposed in the video ""dumb"" and ""embarrassing"". The footage from a 2017 meeting in Ibiza, Spain, with a woman claiming to be the niece of a Russian oligarch was obtained by German publications Der Spiegel and Sueddeutsche Zeitung. GOING IT ALONE AUSTRIAN CHANCELLOR SEBASTIAN KURZ The media outlets did not disclose how they obtained the video and said they do not know the motives of the people who made it. Yet Mr Strache's bid to rescue the coalition with Mr Kurz's People's Party by falling on his sword failed. Mr Kurz cited other scandals over the party's links to far-right groups as well as racist slogans and poems in recent weeks that he had ""swallowed"" to keep the government intact until now. The crisis also is a setback for the Chancellor's bid to neutralise the Freedom Party by embracing it. Snap elections can be formally called either by President Alexander Van der Bellen, who said yesterday that he supports an early vote to restore trust in democracy, or by Parliament dissolving itself. Mr Van der Bellen, who met Mr Kurz yesterday morning, said he would like the election to take place in September. Mr Kurz said after the meeting that he wants to continue governing in the interim, but did not elaborate whether that means Freedom Party ministers except Mr Strache continue on until the vote or he is pushing to replace them. Mr Kurz's bid to go for a government without a partner - a stint Social Democrat Bruno Kreisky last managed in the 1970s and early 1980s - may prove to be a high-stakes gamble. Polls conducted before the scandalous video became public suggested he would win the most votes, but with about 34 per cent support, he is significantly short of a margin large enough to stay in power without an ally. The People's Party's first attempt to govern with the Freedom Party failed in 2002 after two years. The conservatives won an early election at the time but needed a coalition partner to govern. Should Mr Kurz get into a similar situation, he may have difficulties finding allies: A new coalition with the Freedom Party seems impossible after the acrimonious split. At the same time, the 32-year-old Chancellor has burned bridges with the opposition Social Democrats, with whom his party governed in most previous coalitions since World War II. Mr Kurz built his rise to power on breaking with that tradition, so returning to the fold might hurt his credibility. This week's European election will be a first test for him and his rivals. The People's Party is likely to win the most votes in Austria, followed by the Social Democrats. Austria's Audit Court said on Saturday it would have questions about the Freedom Party's finances in the light of the video. The Justice Ministry told Kurier newspaper that prosecutors will be examining the video. The Freedom Party denies any wrongdoing. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday that European politicians ""must stand up to"" far-right politicians ""for sale"" after the hidden-camera sting. While far-right parties rejected values like protecting minorities and basic human rights, Dr Merkel told a press conference in Croatian capital Zagreb that ""politicians being for sale plays a role, and we must act decisively against all of that"".","{'neg': 0.087, 'neu': 0.73, 'pos': 0.183, 'compound': 0.9981}",0.9981

"Palestinians don't need Bahrain meeting, they need peace: Finance minister",Jun 24 2019,"CAIRO () - Palestinians don't need this week's   to develop their country, they need peace, Palestinian Finance Minister Shukri Bishara said on Sunday (June 23). The June 25-26 conference in the Bahraini capital Manama, which the Palestinian Authority is boycotting, will discuss US-led proposals for an economic vision to be presented by US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, part of a wider plan to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The US$50 billion (S$67.76 billion) plan envisions a global investment fund to lift the Palestinian and neighbouring Arab state economies. While many Arab states are attending the meeting, the plan has drawn rebuke as an attempt to circumvent Palestinian demands for an independent state on lands captured in the 1967 war. ""We don't need the Bahrain meeting to build our country, we need peace, and the sequence of (the plan) - economic revival followed by peace - is unrealistic and an illusion,"" Bishara said on the sidelines of a meeting of Arab finance ministers in Cairo. ""First of all, give us our land and our freedom."" While the precise outline of the political part of Kushner's plan has been shrouded in secrecy, officials briefed on it say he has jettisoned the two-state solution that envisages an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza. Kushner told  that the plan, previously dubbed the""deal of the century"", could be the ""opportunity of the century""for the Palestinians. In an address to Sunday's meeting at the Arab League headquarters, Bishara cited the ""bitter experience"" of the Palestinians since the 1993 Oslo Accords, including the US decision to cut aid to the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestinian refugees. ""We are careful and skeptical of what is called the deal of the century - or what was called a couple of days ago, the opportunity of the century,"" Bishara said. Sunday's Arab finance ministers' meeting was called to discuss the Palestinian budget deficit, which Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit put at US$700 million for the current year. The finance ministers said they were committed to activating a financial safety net for the Palestinians of US$100 million a month, agreed upon at previous Arab meetings, Emirates News Agency (WAM) said.","{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.861, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.9349}",0.9349
"UOB, CapBridge partner to offer firms across Asia access to private capital",Jun 24 2019,"SINGAPORE - Global private capital platform CapBridge has inked a deal with United Overseas Bank (UOB) to offer a range of private capital solutions to private, high-growth companies in Singapore and in the bank's key markets, including China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. This is CapBridge's maiden collaboration with a Singapore bank to provide companies with such alternative financing solutions and draws upon the combined market expertise of two Singapore-headquartered financial institutions and the country's strength as a global financial centre, the two parties announced on Sunday evening. Through its investment syndication platform, CapBridge will match UOB's clients with anchor investors and accredited co-investors, catalysing private capital as a source of funding and helping these companies to broaden their investor base further. UOB's clients may also choose to list a portion of their equity on CapBridge's affiliate 1exchange (1X), Singapore's first and only regulated private securities exchange platform, of which Singapore Exchange Limited is a shareholder and strategic partner. This would enable the bank's clients to create a new asset class of tradeable private equities to provide their shareholders with access to flexible financing and liquidity. This is because the buying and selling of the listed private equities can be done any time and easily, compared with the typical lock-up period of more than five years for private equity as an asset class. UOB's head of group investment banking, Edmund Leong, observed that companies typically require different types of funding and capital structures that provide financial flexibility and liquidity to meet their needs at various growth stages. He added that UOB has been providing its corporate clients with a comprehensive suite of fundraising solutions - including loans and bonds in the debt capital markets, initial public offerings in the equity capital markets and alternative private financing through its ecosystem partners. ""With our capital market expertise and through our collaboration with CapBridge and the 1X platform, we can offer our clients an even wider range of alternative private financing solutions to provide them with sustainable growth capital."" Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you.

Malaysia govt make $2 billion bid to take over four highways around Kuala Lumpur,Jun 22 2019,"PUTRAJAYA - The Malaysian government has made a RM6.2 billion (S$2 billion) bid to take over four toll highways in the Klang Valley, in a move to fufil its election pledge to reduce the cost of living by removing toll roads, or at least reducing the fees charged to road users. The four highways, operated by units of listed infrastructure company Gamuda, are among some 20 expressways that criss-cross Kuala Lumpur and its Selangor suburbs. These highways were built from the 1980s onwards as the government under then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad privatised their operations to make them more efficient, but over the years the public has raised complaints of high toll charges.

International Cement fails to get SGX nod for US$104.4m acquisition of African firm,Jun 24 2019,"SINGAPORE - The Singapore Exchange (SGX) has rejected International Cement Group's (ICG) US$104.4 million proposed purchase of a company in Namibia and ordered it to commission pre-deal anti-money laundering due diligence on the source of funds for any future major transactions or very substantial acquisitions. The watch-listed cement producer had first announced the failure to get SGX's approval for the purchase of the entire stake in cement and energy group in Schwenk Namibia in a bourse filing before trading began on Monday morning (June 24). The purchase had been classified as a very substantial acquisition (VSA) under Chapter 10 of the listing manual, but SGX said it did not meet the requirements of a VSA under Rule 1015(2), and thus was unable to approve it, said ICG. Later during the mid-day trading break, ICG disclosed more detailed reasons for SGX's rejection of the deal. SGX said it is of the view that the proposed acquisition does not satisfy Rule 1015(2), which requires the target business to be profitable. It said Schwenk Namibia is not profitable and the foreign exchange losses from the Schwenk loan claim will remain in the pro forma financial statements after the proposed acquisition, and will continue to affect the enlarged group's accounts. SGX also noted that ICG does not have sufficient cash resources to fund the acquisition and intends to possibly obtain significant external loans from financial institutions and shareholders' loan. ""Such loans when considered with the potential losses of Schwenk Namibia will result in a material adverse financial impact on the enlarged group,"" SGX concluded. There is no certainty that the target business will be able to generate sufficient profits to service the loans, and SGX said the acquisition would have put IGC out of a healthy financial position. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  SXX also said that for any future acquisitions, SGX will be requiring IGC to implement certain safeguards. This includes commissioning its external auditors to carry out pre-deal anti-money laundering due diligence for the source of funds for any transactions classified under Rules 1014 and 1015 which cover major transactions and very substantial acquisitions/reverse takeovers respectively. So long as the group operates in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Namibia and/or any other developing jurisdictions, the audit committee and the board must undertake that the company puts in place adequate and effective systems of internal controls (including financial,operational, compliance, information technology and anti-money laundering controls) and risk management systems. For its annual audits, IGC's audit committee must require its external auditors to review its cash management procedures, including for anti-money laundering controls related to IGC's sources of financing for acquisitions, and the group's customers and suppliers. The audit committee must also ensure that its terms of reference include, on an ongoing basis, the monitoring and reviewing of the implementation of the external auditors' and internal auditors' recommendations on internal controls including anti-money laundering. BDO Advisory was appointed as the independent valuer for the proposed acquisition, while Stirling Coleman Capital was the financial adviser. On Monday, ICG said that as a result of SGX's decision, the draft of the shareholders' circular will also not be approved by the bourse operator. The circular would have been despatched for an extraordinary general meeting to obtain shareholders' approval for the acquisition. ICG had announced in March that it was planning to buy Schwenk Namibia and relevant shareholders' loans for US$104.4 million in cash, comprising US$19.3 million for all its shares and another US$85.1 million for the loans. Schwenk Namibia owns a 69.83 per cent stake in Ohorongo Cement, which owns and operates a cement plant at North Otavi in Namibia with an annual production capacity of about 1 million tonnes. Schwenk Namibia also holds a 100 per cent interest in alternative energy sourcing firm EFF. The firm had entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement with vendor Schwenk Zement International Gmbh & Co Kg for the 100 per cent stake acquisition. It had intended to fund the proposed acquisition through third-party financing or borrowings. Shares of ICG on SGX's mainboard were trading flat at 3.2 cents as at 9.14am on Monday.

Billionaire defies retail gloom with offer for Germany's Metro,Jun 24 2019,"LONDON ()- Stores are closing across Europe as consumers shift to e-commerce and discounters barge in. Yet a pair of investors is making an audacious takeover bid for Metro AG, valuing the German chain that sells food and other staples from nondescript warehouses at US$6.6 billion (S$8.94 billion). The offer by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky and his Slovak investment partner Patrik Tkac goes against the grain, but they see an opportunity in Metro's wholesale business model. What they haven't explained is how they plan to turn around a company whose business once included everything from electronics to department stores but now focuses on cash-and-carry outlets in Germany and eastern Europe. It's not alone among European bricks-and-mortar merchants struggling to contend with the rise of Amazon.com and cut-price chains Lidl and Aldi. In the UK, department-store chain House of Fraser was rescued out of insolvency last year while rival Debenhams was taken over by creditors this year. The parent of debt-burdened French grocer Casino Guichard-Perrachon has sought court protection from lenders, while rival Carrefour is restructuring - announcing a deal over the weekend to sell a majority stake in its China business. As ordinary investors grow wary of the sector, wealthy individuals are moving in. Kretinsky and Tkac would join the likes of Mike Ashley, the billionaire UK entrepreneur whose Sports Direct International took over House of Fraser. First they'll have to overcome the opposition of Metro's management, which said the unsolicited offer ""substantially undervalues"" the company. The 16-euro bid for each ordinary share - a meager 3 per cent premium over Friday's close in Frankfurt - doesn't reflect its value creation plan, the Dusseldorf-based company said in a statement. Metro's ordinary shares have jumped about 40 per cent in the past 12 months. Kretinsky, who has a net worth of at least US$3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has no shortage of ambition. Better known for his investments in energy and media, he acquired a stake in French daily Le Monde last year, adding that to a portfolio that also includes the Sparta Prague soccer team. Since its creation in 2009, a debt-fueled acquisition spree turned Kretinsky's EPH from a small Czech utility into one of the biggest energy companies in central Europe. It values its assets in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Italy, the UK, Hungary and Poland at about 13 billion euros (S$20 billion), according to the latest available data from 2017. The energy portfolio includes coal and gas power stations, heating utilities, a pipeline that brings Russian gas to western Europe, and two nuclear power plants. As the European Union tries to push its members to lower greenhouse-gas emissions, Kretinsky is betting that lignite assets will be needed to cover the continent's electricity consumption for years to come. Kretinsky's EP Global Commerce VI holding company, through which he's bidding for Metro, declined to comment on its statement declaring the bid too low. Kretinsky already has a 10.9 per cent stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, meaning the outlay to swallow up the rest of Metro would be about 5.2 billion euros. Haniel Finance Deutschland GmbH, a 15 per cent-holder, has agreed to back the bid. EP Global said it exercised a call option with an affiliate of Ceconomy AG, the electronics retailer that separated from Metro about two years ago but kept a stake, that will transfer the holding to EP Global. In all, that would give the bidders more than 30 per cent of the equity, the data show. The Czech investor sees Metro as a defensive investment to balance riskier, more volatile bets in energy, Haniel chief executive officer Stephan Gemkow said last year, after Kretinsky acquired a stake in Metro. The company's low valuation attracted him, Gemkow said. The bidders said the company needs to make changes to its organization, business and processes to keep competing in a changing landscape. If his bid succeeds, Kretinsky will have to complete the sale of its struggling Real banner, one of the last retail operations it held, to transform it into a pure wholesale company. Metro operates in 36 countries and employs more than 150,000 people worldwide. The bid will be subject to a minimum acceptance threshold, probably in the range of 60 per cent to 75 per cent of Metro's share capital, two people familiar with the matter said. BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse Group and Societe Generale are acting as debt underwriters on the deal. Metro was founded in 1964 by German billionaire Otto Beisheim with the help of the Haniel and Schmidt-Ruthenbeck families. Beisheim introduced the Cash & Carry concept in Germany, and Metro also once owned the Galeria Kaufhof department store chain, which was sold in 2015 to Hudson's Bay Co. If the deal is approved, the buyers said they don't plan to close any of the existing Metro stores in Germany or other core markets or substantially reduce headcount. They want to continue with previously announced plans to sell the Chinese unit.","{'neg': 0.034, 'neu': 0.864, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': 0.9947}",0.9947
YuuZoo to perform support functions from Bangkok; distances itself from closed Singapore office,Jun 24 2019,"SINGAPORE - Mainboard-listed YuuZoo Networks Group Corporation (YuuZoo) said in a regulatory filing on Monday morning that it has set up a new corporate support centre in Bangkok to take over the functions previously provided from Singapore by YuuZooNow Pte Ltd, which closed its Singapore office in March 2019. YuuZoo, a social commerce company whose shares are currently suspended amid investigations into its finances, said that YuuZooNow is not its subsidiary. YuuZooNow is instead a subsidiary of British Virgin Islands-registered YuuZoo Corp, which the company says is a different legal entity with a different board. This is the first time that YuuZoo has said that YuuZoo Corp is a different company. The company listed on the Singapore Exchange in 2014 through a reverse takeover of W Corp as YuuZoo Corp. In 2018, YuuZoo Corp changed its name to the current YuuZoo Networks Group Corp and completed a restructuring to continue the company as a British Virgin Islands-incorporated business. When YuuZoo disclosed the   this year, the company described the closed entities as its ""Singapore-based subsidiaries"". Before 2018, Singapore was YuuZoo's headquarters. In 2018, the company said it had set up a new South-east Asian headquarters for sales in Thailand, but left Singapore as its headquarters for support functions. YuuZoo said that the group will deal with the responsibilities linked to the closure of the Singapore office of YuuZooNow Pte Ltd as soon as SGX lifts the share trading suspension and allows the company to function normally. The new Bangkok support centre will provide accounting, technology, legal, human resource and administrative support. ","{'neg': 0.008, 'neu': 0.916, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': 0.9418}",0.9418

Asian Insider June 24: Trump-Xi meeting at G-20: Will it ease US-China trade tensions?,Jun 24 2019,"In this special edition of the Asian Insider, ST takes an in-depth look at the key issues ahead of the two leaders' meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka later this week.Ling Chang Hong The fallout of this trade war is multifaceted. Last week, hundreds of small American business owners who sell goods imported from China told the US authorities that should the next round of tariffs take effect, they would be forced to raise prices, fire workers, or even shut down.  It ranges from Bibles that are printed in China using specialised machines which US producers are not able to handle, to paint brushes that use imported bristles from a unique breed of hog raised in south-western China. The trade dispute has spilled over to scientific and academic collaboration. As US Bureau Chief Nirmal Ghosh and China Correspondent Danson Cheong report,   Chinese students in the US are facing suspicion that they might be agents of their government, with some facing visa delays or rejections.   Last year, this made up about 3.2 per cent of the 10,313 students hoping to go to the US. In the first three months of this year, the rejection rate went up to 13.5 per cent. Another unlikely victim of the trade war: American movies.  If Hollywood blockblusters get locked out of the world's second-largest film market, it could lead to movie studios cutting their budgets. This turmoil has not spared Singapore, which counts the US as its largest investor and China as its biggest trading partner.  Last month, the Government lowered Singapore's growth forecast for this year to 1.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent, lower than last year's 3.1 per cent.  The semiconductor industry has seen a cyclical slowdown made worse by uncertainties caused by the trade war, while some companies have frozen their headcount, usually the first course of action to control costs. , adding that Singapore will have to focus on factors within its control, such as restructuring its economy and retraining its workers. However, it is not all doom and gloom, analysts say.  These global companies can even set up their regional headquarters in Singapore, creating prospects such as employment for Singaporeans. Thanks to its proximity to China and cheap labour, fledgling economies such as Vietnam and Cambodia stand to benefit from the trade war as businesses start to move their production bases out of China. A Chinese company that makes Apple's AirPods earphones is shifting some production to Vietnam. Seattle-based Brooks Sports is doing the same with its running shoes and apparel production. Swedish furniture giant Ikea has indicated to local suppliers that it wants to rely less on China's furniture makers.  especially in labour-intensive industries like electronics, furniture and apparel. But all this has also exposed the limits of Vietnam's fledgling economy as it struggles to deal with infrastructure bottlenecks, lack of skilled labour and shortage of raw materials. And the momentum is expected to continue as producers shift production of millions of bicycles from China to Cambodia which has a bicycle industry that enjoys tariff-free access to both the US and European Union. Clearly, this trade war is not all about trade. The Trump administration has taken aim at Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies, banning the firm from buying vital US technology without special approval and effectively barring its equipment from US telecom networks on national security grounds. . ""Further trade negotiations are likely impossible unless China sees some potential lifeline for Huawei. It is certainly possible that Trump will offer this, but it is complicated politically for both sides,"" Eurasia Group analysts said.   Huawei, meanwhile, has revealed its Plan B to counter US sanctions:  much to the relief of Huawei smartphone users. , tasking three state-owned telcos with each providing 5G signal coverage in at least 40 cities by the end of the year. All this means China will spend more than 1 trillion yuan building this infrastructure. At the centre of the trade dispute is President Trump's claim that the US loses US$500 billion to China every year. He has promised to cut the trade imbalance to bring factory jobs back to the US, boosting its economy. Just last week, in his speech launching his re-election campaign, Mr Trump again said: ""We rebuilt China. They've done a great job, but they took us for suckers....Five hundred billion, five hundred billion."" But economists say that focusing on trade deficit alone is myopic and tariffs will not bring jobs back to the US.  ""It means that some other country is more efficient at producing the goods than you are,"" explains one analyst.   The use of tariffs, which do not help to reduce the trade deficit, is also likely to manifest as a consumer tax on US consumers, they add. In fact, Mr Trump's own economic adviser   This contrasts with Mr Trump's repeated denials that both sides will suffer from the trade war and that American companies and consumers will pay the tariffs. even if Mr Trump and Mr Xi reach a deal to end the trade war. Experts believe decoupling, driven by wider political and economic forces, would hamstring the Chinese economy, echoing the dominant view in foreign policy and trade circles in Washington that a trade war was America's to win. Amid the caution and pessimism, Foreign Editor Jeremy Au Yong sees some hope yet.  . And for someone who loves reality TV-style showmanship, Mr Trump ""winning"" in trade against foreigners out to sabotage the US economy sure makes for a decent campaign stump speech to rally his base.

"Need to nurture, expand our common spaces: DPM Heng Swee Keat",Jun 22 2019,"Building an inclusive, cohesive society is always a work in progress, both in Singapore and the wider world, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said yesterday.Linette Lai This is why leaders and others must come together to learn from one another, share best practices and tackle common challenges, he added at the close of the three-day inaugural International Conference on Cohesive Societies. Pointing to today's global challenges, he said unprecedented levels of trade, technological advancement and migration have combined in a way that has not worked for some, fuelling tension and conflict. Fault lines have deepened, made worse by the ease with which falsehoods and extremist ideas proliferate online and are exploited. ""Increasingly, nationalism and intolerance are displacing openness and harmony,"" he added. He cited supremacist hate groups and rising hostility to minorities generating a vicious circle of conflict, a factor which led President Halimah Yacob to suggest the event to discuss ways to deepen harmony in and across societies grappling with diversity. Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, said common challenges can be tackled well only if the global community works together, stressing that mutual trust and respect, as well as deeper understanding and harmony, are the foundations on which such efforts must be based.

""Just as each society achieves more together than as disparate individuals, the global community achieves more together when all societies can pursue common goals and tackle common challenges."" Mr Heng added that every society will need to find its own path to cohesion, shaped by its history, context, culture and demands. He pointed out that throughout human history, many societies that embraced their diversity thrived - like the Malacca Sultanate in the 15th century, whose inhabitants came from all over, bringing with them their unique religious beliefs, intermarrying and exchanging cultures. As for Singapore, he said, it is becoming more diverse, and this means its common spaces will ""be harder to maintain, and must be deliberately nurtured and expanded"". ""As our racial and religious demographics shift, so too must our approach to building bridges and encouraging discourse,"" he added. Mr Heng noted there are now more interfaith families in Singapore - an opportunity to deepen mutual understanding. Also, 22 per cent of marriages are between people of different ethnic groups, and nearly 20 per cent of Singaporeans do not identify with a religion. He said: ""We must learn to include their perspectives in our discourses."" He also outlined Singapore's approach to deepen cohesion. First, it expands common spaces and shared experiences, while preserving racial and religious diversity. Next, it is vigilant to guard against forces that can tear society apart, including establishing institutional structures that prevent groups or individuals from exploiting racial and religious fault lines. Lastly, the Government works to provide Singaporeans with better lives and to ensure all share in the fruits of progress. ""In growing our economy, we put a special focus on creating good jobs for all Singaporeans, regardless of which community they belong to,"" he said. ""Some workers have benefited more from this growth than others. This is why we continue to work hard to address social inequality, to better distribute the fruits of growth.""

Indonesia 'to vet civil servants in bid to weed out radical Islamists',Jun 22 2019,"JAKARTA • Indonesia plans to tighten the vetting of senior public servants amid fears that hardline Islamist ideology has permeated high levels of government, according to documents seen by  and a senior official involved in the plan. Indonesia is officially secular, but there has been a rise in politicians demanding a larger role for Islam in the world's biggest Muslim-majority country, with some groups calling for an Islamic state. The rise in conservatism was a major test for President Joko Widodo in the April election, with some Islamist groups accusing him of being anti-Islam and supporting his political rivals, including challenger Prabowo Subianto. Mr Joko was re-elected for a second term but voting patterns revealed deepening divisions between areas known for a moderate following of Islam and conservative Muslim regions that backed Mr Prabowo. The senior government official, who is part of a team formulating the new vetting policy, said Mr Joko intends it to be a part of his legacy of ensuring Indonesia remains a model for moderate Islam. The official said the President strongly believes that radical Islam threatens the state apparatus as well as the future of democracy. The vetting plan was a big priority for him, said the official, who declined to be identified.

Keep up with the latest in the region with the ST Asian Insider newsletter, delivered to your inbox every weekday By signing up, you agree to our   and  According to the documents seen by , the government wants to introduce stricter background checks and a new psychological test to gauge candidates' political leanings - especially for those seeking promotions to the top two rungs of the bureaucracy. The official said the plan will be rolled out by the end of the year at 10 of the country's biggest ministries by budget and several state-owned enterprises. Ministries to be targeted as priorities include finance, defence, health, education, religious affairs, and public works. Priority enterprises include state energy company Pertamina, flag carrier Garuda Indonesia, the biggest state bank BRI, state miners Antam and Timah, and two state media companies. Civil servants would not be sacked but the new policy could be used to keep those with hardline leanings from rising through the ranks, the official said. ""What we're seeing is not sudden but the result of seeds that were planted years ago through small movements that at the time were not considered a threat to the state. For over 10 years, these ideas have been tolerated, accepted, and perhaps even used by elements of the state,"" a government paper said. The government official who spoke to  is part of a team of 12 officials and experts that will work with the National Agency to Promote Pancasila and with civil society organisations to formulate new metrics to strengthen existing recruitment tests. Pancasila, the country's official, foundational philosophical theory, includes upholding national unity, social justice and democracy alongside belief in God, and enshrines religious diversity in an officially secular system of government. The official said the government is expecting a backlash both from within the state bureaucracy and from rights activists who could liken the moves to the authoritarian era of former president Suharto, when loyalty to the state ideology was mandatory and equated with loyalty to the regime. A representative for the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), an Islamist group that calls for syariah law in Indonesia, said the planned vetting procedures would ""amount to discrimination against Islam"". ""This government is affected by the disease of secularism and is trying to separate politics and religion, which is very dangerous,"" said Mr Novel Bamukmin of the FPI's Jakarta chapter. ""They should be focusing on targeting the communists and Shi'ite (minority Muslims) in the bureaucracy instead,"" he added.  ","{'neg': 0.02, 'neu': 0.879, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': 0.9954}",0.9954
"Writer accuses Trump of sexual assault more than two decades ago, an allegation he denies",Jun 22 2019,"WASHINGTON (WASHINGTON POST) - A New York-based writer and long-time women's advice columnist, E. Jean Carroll,   in a dressing room of an upscale Manhattan department store, an episode detailed in a book excerpt published on Friday (June 21) in New York magazine. In an interview with The Washington Post on Friday afternoon, Ms Carroll reiterated the allegations, saying that during a chance encounter with the then real estate developer at Bergdorf Goodman in late 1995 or early 1996, Mr Trump attacked her in a dressing room. She said he knocked her head against a wall, pulled down her tights and briefly penetrated her before she pushed him off and ran out. She said she hoped that telling her story ""will empower women to come forward and not feel bad... I blamed myself and I was silent and I felt guilty. I beat up myself terrible."" Ms Carroll, now 75, said she told two close friends about the episode at the time. One of them told The Post on Friday that Ms Carroll described the incident to her shortly after it occurred and that she had unsuccessfully urged Ms Carroll to go to the police. Mr Trump vigorously denied the accusation, calling it ""fake news"". He questioned why there was no video footage of the incident or witnesses in the store. ""I've never met this person in my life,"" the president said in a statement. ""She is trying to sell a new book - that should indicate her motivation. It should be sold in the fiction section."" The New York magazine piece includes a photo provided by Ms Carroll of what appears to be Mr Trump pictured from behind, standing with his then wife Ivana, and Ms Carroll's then husband John Johnson, at what Ms Carroll said was an NBC party around 1987. In his statement, Mr Trump asked that anyone who has information that Ms Carroll or the magazine were working with the Democratic Party to come forward. ""It is a disgrace and people should pay dearly for such false accusations,"" he said. Ms Carroll, a registered Democrat, said she voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. She donated US$1,000 (US$1,355) this cycle to Emily's List, which supports female candidates who back abortion rights, and US$500 to President Barack Obama's reelection campaign in 2012, according to campaign finance records. On Twitter, she has posted several sharp remarks about Trump and retweets of satirical and critical articles about him. ""This is not political,"" Ms Carroll said of her decision to talk publicly about Mr Trump. ""Sexual violence is not political."" Ms Carroll, a long-time advice columnist for Elle magazine, is among 16 women who have publicly accused Mr Trump of sexual misconduct over the past several decades. Most spoke out just weeks before the 2016 election, after The Post published a recording of Mr Trump bragging during a 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" interview that his celebrity gave him permission to grab women by their genitals. Mr Trump has denied the allegations and called the women ""liars"". One Trump accuser, former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos, is suing the president for defamation in New York, a case in which her lawyers may have the opportunity to question him under oath. Ms Zervos alleges that Mr Trump forcibly kissed and groped her at the Beverly Hills Hotel in December 2007. Ms Carroll's allegation about Mr Trump is among the most violent of the accusations against him. His ex-wife, Ivana, said in a divorce deposition that he ""raped"" her in 1989, but later said, ""I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense."" Ms Carroll said she didn't come forward in 2016 because other women did, adding that she ""didn't have the guts"". But now, inspired by the #MeToo movement that began in late 2017, she said, ""It's time. It's time."" She said she felt like she had disappointed all the readers of her ""Ask E. Jean"" column in Elle magazine who have confided in her about their problems with men over the past 26 years. Like many of the women who told her they had been sexually assaulted, Ms Carroll said she blamed herself for the incident. ""I thought I was stupid,"" she said. ""I really thought I had done it."" Ms Carroll spoke by phone to The Post hours after New York magazine posted an online excerpt of her forthcoming book, What Do We Need Men For? She also did interviews on Friday with other news organisations, her publicist said. Mr Trump is among a number of men who forced themselves on her, Ms Carroll alleges in her book. She writes that Les Moonves, the once-powerful chief executive of CBS who resigned a year ago after several women accused him of sexual misconduct, grabbed her in an elevator of a Beverly Hills hotel after she interviewed him for a 1997 Esquire magazine story. ""He went at me like an octopus,"" she said. ""I actually thought he had grown extra arms."" A spokesman for Moonves referred The Post to a statement the former CBS chief gave New York magazine, in which he ""emphatically denies"" the episode. Mr Dana McClintock, a CBS spokesman, declined to comment. Ms Carroll said her encounter with Mr Trump began one weeknight evening, when she ran into him as she was leaving the department store. At the time, Ms Carroll was hosting a cable television show and she said he recognised her, calling her ""that advice lady"". ""He was very good looking at the time and personable,"" she said. She said he asked her to help him pick out a present for a woman. When Ms Carroll asked how old the woman was, she said Trump responded by asking her age. She told him she was 52, to which she said he responded, ""You're so old."" Mr Trump would have been about 49 at the time. Ms Carroll said he considered buying a fur hat and then led her up the escalator to the lingerie department. She said the area was empty. He picked up some lingerie, a flimsy gray bodysuit, and asked her to try it on, suggesting she was ""in shape"", she said. She said that she responded by urging him to put it on. ""It occurred to me it would be very funny if I could get him to try it on over his pants,"" she said. ""I just thought this was the greatest joke in the world."" But after they walked into the dressing room, she said Mr Trump pinned her against the wall, tried to kiss her and touched her genital area. Then he unzipped his pants and sexually assaulted her. ""It was shocking. I fought, it was against my will,"" Ms Carroll said, though she didn't scream. ""I laughed. That's how I deal with it. Adrenaline was pouring through my body."" Ms Carroll provided The Post with the names of the two friends she said she had told about the incident at the time. One could not be reached Friday evening. The other friend, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her privacy, said Ms Carroll called her either the day of the alleged attack or the next day and described the assault. The friend, an author and former TV morning show correspondent, recalled Ms Carroll was laughing slightly manically as she recounted what happened. ""It's not funny,"" the friend said she told Ms Carroll. ""He raped you."" She said she urged Ms Carroll to go to the police, but she said Ms Carroll refused, saying it was just 15 minutes of her life and she wanted to move on. The friend said Ms Carroll made her promise to never tell anyone. The alleged incident occurred too long ago to bring charges. Although the New York state legislature ended statutory limits on forceable rape in 2006, the new law applies only to crimes that occurred in 2001 or later. On the cover of New York magazine, Ms Carroll is featured wearing the black Donna Karan coatdress that she said she had on when Trump attacked her. She said it has been hanging in the back of her closet since that day and that she has never considered testing it for DNA evidence. She said she has not had sex since the incident.

Former Malaysia defence minister Hishamuddin questioned over land swop deals,Jun 23 2019,"PUTRAJAYA () - Former defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein showed up at the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) headquarters for questioning on land swop deals involving his former ministry.

He added that he was not sure what he will be questioned about and how long the interrogation would take. On May 17, the Defence Ministry handed over 14 reports on the alleged dubious land swop, after surrendering two reports earlier. The reports were the findings of the Governance, Procurement and Finance Investigating Committee that had investigated 16 deals involving 1,183ha of land belonging to the Defence Ministry. The land swop contracts, which went back several decades, were about ministry land in good locations near big cities that was handed to private companies, in exchange for the construction of military camps in remote areas.

Malaysian Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng says seizure of funds from China's CPP not by his ministry,Jul 15 2019,"KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia's Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said on Monday (July 15) that his ministry did not issue any instructions to seize more than RM1 billion (S$330 million) in funds from state-owned China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering (CPP). His comments followed   over the weekend that cited sources as saying the government had ordered the seizure. The report, published in the paper's Sunday edition, said the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government had early this month ordered that the funds be seized from a CPP account held with global banking giant HSBC in Malaysia and transferred to Suria Strategic Energy Resources, a company wholly owned by the Ministry of Finance. ""I would just like to say that neither the Finance Ministry nor I issued any instructions for the seizure,"" The Star newspaper quoted Mr Lim as telling reporters in Parliament's lobby on Monday. ""So, if there are any instructions of seizure, you should refer to the enforcement agencies. That's all I want to say,"" he added. The report, citing lawyers and bankers familiar with the situation, said the moves came against the backdrop of an ongoing dispute involving two multibillion-dollar energy pipeline projects in which CPP was the lead contractor that were suspended last July. The pipeline projects were awarded to CPP in November 2016 by the previous Barisan Nasional government of prime minister Najib Razak but they have been in limbo after the PH alliance took office following its victory at the May election last year. The projects were a 600km multi-product pipeline along the west coast of peninsular Malaysia costing RM5.35 billion and a gas pipeline network in the East Malaysian state of Sabah costing RM4.06 billion. CPP, in response to queries from The Sunday Times, confirmed that the funds were transferred out, while the HSBC corporate office in Kuala Lumpur declined to comment, citing client confidentiality. ""CPP firmly abides (by) the laws of Malaysia and is perplexed by the unilateral transfer of monies without notifying CPP,"" the company, a unit of China's state-owned oil and gas giant China National Petroleum Corp, told The Sunday Times. CPP said it is speaking to the relevant parties in a bid to understand the basis of the transfer and would take appropriate actions to protect its rights once it has further information. Bankers familiar with the situation said that certain bank accounts held by CPP, including the monies in HSBC, were frozen by the Malaysian government after the projects were suspended.","{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.929, 'pos': 0.045, 'compound': 0.5423}",0.5423

"Missing GST refunds were not stolen, says public accounts committee in Malaysia",Jul 15 2019,"KUALA LUMPUR - Goods and services tax (GST) refunds for businesses worth RM19.4 billion (S$6.41 billion) that allegedly went missing from government coffers during former prime minister Najib Razak's tenure were not stolen as had been claimed, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said Monday (July 15).Hazlin Hassan ""There was no money missing from the GST collection,"" PAC chairman Noraini Ahmad said in a statement just before the committee released a report on the matter. The former Barisan Nasional (BN) government had overestimated the GST revenue generated and experienced a shortfall.  It then used the GST refund money, which had been moved to the government's consolidated account instead of the GST refunds account, to pay for development and management costs. ""The previous government had overestimated the GST revenue by 65 per cent,"" said Datuk Noraini, an Umno MP who took over as PAC chairman in April this year. She added that the delay in refunding companies was to ensure that Malaysia's cash flow was not negative. Allegations of impropriety emerged in August last year when Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng told Parliament during a debate to abolish the GST that the previous BN government had been stealing tax refunds that were meant to have been returned to businesses. Keep up with the latest in the region with the ST Asian Insider newsletter, delivered to your inbox every weekday By signing up, you agree to our   and  He said the GST refunds were not paid for two years because 93 per cent of the money had not been placed into the correct account. And as of May 31 last year, the outstanding GST refund amount stood at RM19.39 billion while there was only RM1.486 billion left in the repayment fund, Mr Lim added. Najib had denied the allegations in Parliament, stating that the money was put into the government's consolidated fund, which was paid out to a trust fund. In the report released Monday, Attorney-General Tommy Thomas said that the previous government's move to channel GST revenue into the federal government's consolidated account was wrong. In a letter dated October 9, 2018 to the PAC, Mr Thomas said it was a breach of fundamental trust law principles and trust accounting requirements, and that “criminal liability must be further considered.”  PH lawmakers said that the authorities must investigate the BN officials responsible for violating the GST refund rules. Democratic Action Party lawmaker Chan Foong Hin said: “By diverting the RM19.4 billion meant for refunds elsewhere, Najib has indeed (robbed) companies and entrepreneurs of their time sensitive business opportunities.”  The PAC began a probe on the matter on Sept 12 last year, calling in 10 witnesses including the Finance Minister. Following the statement from the PAC, opposition leader and Umno lawmaker Ismail Sabri Yaakob on Monday moved a motion in Parliament to refer Mr Lim to the Rights and Privileges Committee for misleading the House. “The PAC report on GST refunds today (showed) that there is no disappearance or robbery as claimed by the minister,” he said. “As such, the opposition would like to... refer the minister to the Rights and Privileges Committee.” Umno lawmaker Khairy Jamaluddin asked that a decision be made in the current sitting, which concludes Thursday, to which the deputy speaker Nga Kor Ming replied: “I give my assurance that the decision will be made in line with the law.”  The administration of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad abolished the unpopular GST system as part of its manifesto promises, after winning the May 9 General Election last year. But in September, it reintroduced the sales and services tax (SST), drawing much criticism from many ordinary Malaysians who described it as worse than the GST.","{'neg': 0.055, 'neu': 0.868, 'pos': 0.076, 'compound': 0.9123}",0.9123
Japan sets up working group on impact of Facebook's Libra ahead of G-7,Jul 13 2019,"TOKYO () - Japanese authorities have set up a working group to discuss the impact Facebook's proposed Libra digital coin could have on monetary policy and financial regulation, government sources said, ahead of a G-7 finance leaders' gathering where the topic will be high on the agenda. The working group, consisting of the Bank of Japan, the Ministry of Finance and the Financial Services Agency, began meeting this week and will seek to coordinate policies to address the impact Libra could have on regulation, monetary policy, tax and payments settlement, the sources said. The plan by the social media giant to build a digital currency has raised concerns among global regulators that it could quickly become systemic given Facebook's huge cross-border reach. France is using its presidency of the Group of 7 group of economic powers to launch a task force to look at how central banks can ensure digital currencies like Libra are regulated from money-laundering to consumer-protection rules. European Central Bank policymaker Benoit Coeure is due to deliver a preliminary report on the matter next week at a meeting of G-7 finance ministers in Chantilly, north of Paris. Japan hopes to rally support from other countries to expand the task force into a bigger group of tax and financial regulators, given the wide range of policies that could be affected by digital currencies, the officials said.

Ex-students recall Epstein's persistent attention on girls,Jul 14 2019,"NEW YORK • In the mid-1970s, students at one of New York's most esteemed prep schools were surprised to encounter a new teacher who pushed the limits on the school's strict dress code, wandering the halls in a fur coat, gold chains and an open shirt that exposed his chest. The teacher, Jeffrey Epstein, would decades later face allegations that he coerced and trafficked teenagers for sex. At the Dalton School on the Upper East Side, some students saw Epstein as an unusual and unsettling figure, willing to violate the norms in his encounters with girls. One former student recalled him showing up at a party where students were drinking, while most remembered his persistent attention on the girls in hallways and classrooms. ""I can remember thinking at the time, 'This is wrong',"" said Mr Scott Spizer, who graduated from Dalton in 1976. None of the female students who spoke to The New York Times in recent days remembered Epstein, a hedge fund manager, making unwanted physical contact with them when he was a teacher, and he has not been accused of any crimes related to his time at the school. But a few students said they had been so discomfited by a close relationship he had with one of their female peers that one of them raised the issue to a school administrator. Dalton has long been known for its rigorous academics, repeatedly ranking among the best private schools in the US while drawing the children of New York's titans of finance, media and art. Among the alumni are CNN journalist Anderson Cooper, actress Claire Danes and comedian Chevy Chase. Epstein's time at Dalton was brief, and an administrator said it ended in a dismissal. While Epstein later developed a reputation in the world of finance as a man of brilliance, the administrator said he had dismissed the then teacher for poor performance. LISTENING EAR MS LESLIE KITZIGER, a Dalton graduate who remembers Jeffrey Epstein as a flamboyant dresser and lively joker. She said she became close to him at a time when she was struggling at home with her parents' divorce, but stressed that he was always professional with her. But the accounts offer a window into Epstein's early adulthood, before he developed extensive private wealth that allowed him to acquire a US$56 million (S$76 million) mansion not far from the Dalton School. It was there, prosecutors said last week, that Epstein and his employees paid ""numerous"" underage girls to engage in sex acts with him. Federal prosecutors in New York last Monday charged Epstein, 66, with sex trafficking. He has pleaded not guilty. Among the women who have said they were abused by Epstein when they were teenagers are Ms Courtney Wild and Ms Michelle Licata. They were in court on Monday observing the proceedings. ""I was 14. I had braces on,"" Ms Wild told ABC News. Epstein, from Brooklyn, was in his early 20s when he was hired at Dalton, arriving without a college degree. A profile in the New York Magazine reported that Epstein worked at the school starting in 1973, but the school's yearbooks do not show him as a teacher until the 1974-75 academic year. In February 1974, disciplinarian headmaster Donald Barr announced he was resigning as headmaster. A year after he left, Dalton, under the leadership of Mr Gardner Dunnan, tentatively explored a rollback of some of the strict rules. Mr Dunnan has faced his own allegations of inappropriate conduct. A former student said in a lawsuit that she was invited to live with Mr Dunnan at age 14 and suffered sexual assaults under his care. Mr Dunnan denies the allegations. At Dalton, Epstein was known as a charismatic teacher who at times acted more like a friend than an authority figure to students. INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOUR MS MILLICENT YOUNG, a Dalton graduate, who recalls observing Jeffrey Epstein flirting with the girls at the school, which drew her attention because it was so different from how other teachers behaved. Ms Leslie Kitziger, who graduated in 1978, remembered him as a flamboyant dresser and lively joker. She said she became close to Epstein at a time when she was struggling at home with her parents' divorce. ""He listened,"" Ms Kitziger recalled. ""I was a 14-year-old and he helped me through a time when there wasn't anybody else to talk to. I felt like he really cared that I was having a rough go."" She stressed that Epstein was always professional with her. But other students, including Ms Millicent Young, a graduate of the school's 1976 class, saw things differently. She recalled observing Epstein flirting with the girls at the school, which drew her attention because it was so different from how other teachers behaved. ""There was a real clarity of the inappropriateness of the behaviour - that this isn't how adult male teachers conduct themselves,"" she said. Accusations of sexual predation have dogged Epstein for decades but he served only 13 months in prison largely because of a secret deal his lawyers struck with federal prosecutors in Miami in 2008. His case had been held up as a prime example of how insulated, powerful men can escape accountability. His social circle is filled with the rich and famous, including former president Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew of Britain and US President Donald Trump. Monday's charges dealt an implicit rebuke to that plea agreement, which was overseen by Mr Alexander Acosta, then the US attorney in Miami. Mr Acosta resigned as Mr Trump's labour secretary on Friday.","{'neg': 0.061, 'neu': 0.86, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': 0.9582}",0.9582
Digital tax plans in different countries,Jul 13 2019,"Britain on Thursday unveiled draft legislation for a ""digital services tax"" on global technology giants which it plans to impose until leading economies reach an agreement on the contentious issue. The proposed levy of 2 per cent planned for next April will target ""large digital businesses"" and reflect ""the value derived from their UK users"", according to the country's finance ministry. Earlier this year, Australia abandoned plans for a digital services tax, opting instead to wait for a global agreement on the best way to handle the taxing of the revenues. Group of 20 (G-20) finance ministers agreed last month to compile common rules to close loopholes used by global technology giants to reduce their corporate taxes. Singapore will levy a tax on overseas suppliers of digital services from next year. The so-called ""Netflix tax"" will expand the goods and services tax (GST) to companies without a physical presence in the country. The 7 per cent GST - which is set to rise to 9 per cent between 2021 and 2025 - will be collected from vendors that sell more than $100,000 in digital services to Singapore consumers and have a global turnover of over $1 million. The Singapore Government has said the tax will level the playing field for local retailers, which are already subject to GST. The tax is expected to bring in around $90 million a year. Malaysia will implement a digital tax from next year, with the rate set at 6 per cent. The government said the tax is being intro-duced to level the playing field between local and foreign companies. The tax is applicable only to companies earning more than RM500,000 (S$165,400) from Malay-sian consumers, and on any person providing digital services - regardless of nationality - located outside Malaysia. Indonesia sees the value-added tax (VAT) as the quickest means to get tax revenue from foreign e-commerce companies. Local e-commerce unicorns currently pay 25 per cent corporate tax, and the authorities have been exploring ways to level the playing field. Options include requiring e-commerce companies that sell to consumers in Indonesia to dis-close their audited financial reports and incorporate local entities. India does not have a digital tax, but the tax department is set to scrutinise international companies such as Google and Facebook for any under-reporting of their revenues in India. In 2016, the South Asian country imposed an equalisation levy of 6 per cent, which is a tax deducted at source on payments made by Indian companies to foreign e-commerce firms that are not based in India. The tax is applicable to payments of more than 100,000 rupees (S$1,980) a year for online advertising. A digital tax is unlikely to be imposed in China, which has been expanding tax relief for high-tech service firms to foster innovation, attract foreign capital and grow its services industry. Last year, the government further reduced the corporate tax rate for Technology Advanced Service Companies to 15 per cent, even as it expanded the definition of such companies to include those in IT outsourcing, information system integration and media firms. Japan plans to table a Bill next year to regulate technology giants after having led the G-20 last month to agree to push forward on digital taxation. The tax sheriff has gone after companies such as Google Japan and SoftBank in recent years for reducing their tax liability by declaring Japan-taxable income in overseas jurisdictions that grant tax concessions. According to the draft law seen by Kyodo News, Japan aims to increase oversight on these com-panies by making their business transactions more transparent. South Korea started imposing a 10 per cent tax on digital services provided by foreign technology giants from the start of this month, making them pay the same amount of value-added tax as Korean companies.","{'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.917, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': 0.9698}",0.9698
US scrambles to broker a deal as countries look to tax technology giants,Jul 13 2019,"WASHINGTON • For most of the 21st century, wealthy countries have engaged in a race to the bottom on corporate taxes, cutting rates in an effort to poach business activity across borders. Very quickly, that script has flipped. Developed countries are now moving to impose new taxes on technology companies such as Facebook and Google which have a large presence in their citizens' daily lives, but pay those countries little tax on the profits they earn there. On Thursday, France moved to become the first country to impose a so-called digital tax of 3 per cent on the revenue companies earn from providing digital services to French users. It would apply to large companies, numbering more than two dozen, with robust annual sales in France, including US-based Facebook, Google and Amazon. On Thursday, British leaders also detailed plans to impose a similar tax, of 2 per cent, on technology giants. And the European Union has also been mulling over a digital tax. The digital revenue grab is pitting traditional allies against one another, threatening to set off a cascade of tax increases and tariffs unless political and economic leaders work out a multinational agreement to avert them. Late on Wednesday, the Trump administration said it would pursue an investigation into whether France's technology tax amounted to an unfair trade practice that could be punishable with retaliatory tariffs. Administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have also raised concerns about Britain's move. The French tax, which would exact a bigger toll on foreign companies than French ones, has been denounced by the US technology industry, along with Democratic and Republican leaders, who are looking for ways to avoid such one-off decisions by more closely coordinating international digital tax arrangements. US administration officials have tried to shape an effort by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to broker an international system for taxing digital profits. Countries have competed to reduce corporate tax rates, and attract business activity, both physically and on paper, for two decades. The average rate tracked by the OECD has fallen 7 percentage points since 2000 to just over 21 per cent today. The revenue of technology companies has surged worldwide, but not their tax payments, prompting many wealthy governments to complain that digital businesses are not paying their fair share. The EU calculates that the revenue of digital companies is growing more than four times as fast as revenue for other multinational companies, partly from advertising sales to European consumers. As the firms have a relatively light physical presence in Europe, they benefit from the current system, which taxes companies based on where their operations and assets are - and not where their sales are generated. The EU has said this has allowed technology companies to pay less than half the effective tax rate of other multinationals. During meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in April, Mr Mnuchin said it was a priority to find an international solution, and he pressed France and Britain to abandon their own tax plans once a compromise is reached. At the Group of 20 finance ministers' meeting in Japan last month, the ministers agreed in their communique to work towards finding a common set of rules to close loopholes that global technology companies have been using to reduce their tax bills. The United States has called for a tax that is based on companies' income, not sales, and said specific industries should not be singled out with a different standard.","{'neg': 0.067, 'neu': 0.845, 'pos': 0.088, 'compound': 0.9261}",0.9261
The Nordic model may be the best cushion against capitalism. Can it survive immigration?,Jul 13 2019,"FILIPSTAD, SWEDEN (NYTIMES) - At first, local leaders were inclined to see the refugees as an opportunity. The iron ore mines had shut down. So had a factory that made machinery for the logging industry. The town had been abandoned, its population cut in half. A shot at replenishment appeared at hand. It was the summer of 2015, and people were arriving from some of the most troubled places on earth - Syria, Somalia, Iraq. They would fill vacant homes, learn Swedish, and take jobs caring for older Swedes. They would pay taxes, helping finance the extensive social welfare programmes that have made Sweden a rarity in the world, a country seemingly at peace in an age of tempestuous global capitalism. But four years after the influx, growing numbers of native-born Swedes have come to see the refugees as a drain on public finances. Some decry an assault on ""Swedish heritage,"" or ""Swedish culture,"" or other words that mean white, Christian and familiar. Antipathy for immigrants now threatens to erode support for Sweden's social welfare state. ""People don't want to pay taxes to support people who don't work,"" said Mr Urban Pettersson, 62, a member of the local council in Filipstad, a town set in lake country west of Stockholm. ""Ninety per cent of the refugees don't contribute to society. These people are going to have a lifelong dependence on social welfare. This is a huge problem."" In a global economy increasingly besieged by rage over inequality and the pitfalls of winner-take-all capitalism, Sweden has long stood out as a kinder, gentler sort of country, a potential template for other nations eager to avoid destructive populism. The so-called Nordic model that prevails in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Iceland has been engineered to protect people from the commonplace economic afflictions assailing many developed countries, and especially the United States. There, the loss of a job can swiftly imperil health care, housing, sustenance and mental well-being. Under the Nordic model, governments typically furnish health care, education and pensions to everyone. The state delivers subsidised housing and child care. When people lose jobs, they gain unemployment benefits and highly effective job training programmes. When children are born, parents avail themselves of paid leave that seems unimaginable in most societies - 480 days in Sweden. ""If you're born in Sweden, you've basically won at life,"" said Mr Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. As world leaders debate how to keep the innovative forces of capitalism while more equitably spreading the bounty, the Nordic model is often played up as a promising approach. In the rest of the world, workers generally fear automation as a threat to paychecks. In Sweden, people are strikingly optimistic about robots given their faith in the social welfare model. If technology destroys some jobs, it will create others, they reckon, while training and state support will enable them to manage the transition. But the endurance of the Nordic model has long depended on two crucial elements - the public's willingness to pay some of the highest taxes on earth, and the understanding that everyone is supposed to work. The state ensures that working-age people are prepared with the skills for high-wage jobs, in industries like technology and advanced manufacturing. Sweden's sharp influx of immigrants - the largest of any European nation, as a share of the overall population - directly tests this proposition. At the peak in 2015, 160,000 refugees sought asylum in Sweden, a country of 10 million people. That is equivalent to more than 5 million refugees arriving in the United States in a year. Over the last two decades, the share of foreign-born people has risen from 11 per cent of the Swedish population to 19 per cent. Many of the refugees have little education and do not speak Swedish, making them difficult to employ. Public opinion surveys show that Swedes remain willing to accept their tax burden. But as citizens absorb the reality that many refugees will rely on welfare for years, some are balking at the cost while demanding limits on government aid for jobless people. ""People are quite open to showing solidarity for people who are like themselves,"" said Mr Carl Melin, policy director at Futurion, a research institution in Stockholm. ""They don't show solidarity for people who are different."" The primary vessel of discontent is the Sweden Democrats, a right-wing political party with roots in the neo-Nazi movement. Over the last decade, the party has emerged from the extremist wilderness to secure mainstream status, last year capturing the third largest bloc of seats in parliament. The party has gained force amid anger over an economy that has stagnated in recent years, and frustration over cuts to social services that have been unfolding for a quarter-century. The party has also been propelled by revulsion over multi-culturalism in towns like Filipstad, where Muslim women in headscarves now wheel toddlers down sidewalks. ""These immigrants don't speak the same language,"" said Mr Pettersson, a Sweden Democrat, over coffee in a downtown cafe specialising in Swedish pastries. ""They have different religions, different ways of life. If there are too many differences, it's harder to get along. It's interesting to meet someone from another country for maybe half an hour, but if you're going to live together, it's tough."" He favours sending refugees back to their home countries through ""voluntary repatriation,"" he said, rather than squandering public money on doomed efforts to integrate them. ""We don't have infinite resources,"" Mr Pettersson said. ""Either it's higher taxes, or you have to cut something."" Sweden has long had a reputation for welcoming the exiles of war. And it also claims distinction as the nation that spends the largest percentage of its wealth on aid for developing countries. ""We've seen ourselves as a superpower in terms of doing good things,"" saidMr Marten Blix, an economist at the Research Institute of Industrial Economics in Stockholm. When the national government began bringing refugees to Filipstad in 2012, local officials received assurances they would not be left to fend for themselves. The state was eager to put refugees in small towns rather than in cities like Stockholm, where housing was scarce and expensive. National authorities agreed to cover rent, food, clothing and specialised medical care for the first two years. After that, municipalities would inherit responsibility, though costs were assumed to be minimal: By then, most refugees would supposedly be able to support themselves. That was a fantasy, said Mr Hannes Fellsman. He manages work and education programmes at a unit the local government set up in 2015 to prepare refugees for careers. He and his colleagues quickly grasped this was going to require substantial resources. Early waves of refugees from Syria and Iraq included doctors, accountants and other professionals. Language training allowed them to resume their careers. The people arriving later tended to have little education. Many had suffered trauma, requiring mental health counseling. Roughly one-fifth of Filipstad's nearly 11,000 inhabitants are now foreign-born. Among the 750 working-age people, 500 have received less than a high school education. Two hundred are illiterate. ""The state keeps saying we need to prepare people to get jobs fast,"" Mr Fellsman said. ""That's impossible. You have to educate them."" Preparing lower-skilled refugees for work would be a challenge anywhere. In Sweden it is uniquely difficult, given how the economy is centreed on highly skilled, highly paid pursuits. It has been engineered to minimise the sorts of low-paying service sector jobs that consign people in other countries to the ranks of the working poor. Some argue that Sweden must allow lower-wage service sector jobs to emerge, enabling immigrants to secure a hold in the economy by cleaning homes or taking care of children - ideally with a government subsidy. But unions are hostile, seeing this as a dangerous precedent that could expose Sweden to the forces of downward mobility at work in other countries. Until recently, Swedes were not accustomed to hiring people for menial work, typically preferring to clean their own homes. Yet absent some fresh approach to increasing employment, an alarming divide seems certain to widen. The unemployment rate was only 3.8 per cent among the Swedish-born populace last year, but 15 per cent among foreign-born, notes Ms Marika Lindgren Asbrink, a researcher at LO, Sweden's largest labour union. Roughly half of all jobless people in Sweden were foreign-born. Among supporters of the Sweden Democrats, these sorts of numbers are cited as evidence that refugees have flocked here to enjoy lives of state-financed sloth. ""We have to demand that people work or they cannot get benefits,"" said Mr Ted Bondesson, a 22-year-old university student, as he celebrates Flag Day at a barbecue thrown by the Sweden Democrats in the southern town of Horby. ""We can't pay for the whole world."" The mayor of the town, Ms Cecilia In Zito, a Sweden Democrat, said refugees have refused to assimilate. ""I would start by forcing them to learn Swedish,"" she said. Such depictions astonish Mr Babak Jamali. Six years ago, when he was 13, he left his home in war-torn Afghanistan, riding in the trunk of a car through Pakistan and into Iran. There, he found construction jobs for about US$2 (S$2.71) a day, squatting in half-finished apartment blocks while struggling to evade police. He paid a smuggler to truck him into Turkey. He rode buses up the Balkan Peninsula and eventually to Germany, where he slept on the floor of a mosque. He rode a train to the Swedish city of Malmo and applied for asylum. For the last year, he has lived with a pro-refugee activist in the fields outside Horby in a house heated by a wood stove and lacking plumbing. On paper, Mr Jamali, 19, is the worst case for Sweden. Before arriving, he had no formal schooling, making him another illiterate, unskilled person ill-suited for work. But he chafes at the notion that he is a drain on society. He cannot work while his asylum case is pending, so he goes into Horby six days a week to study Swedish. He walks 15 minutes up a dirt road to the highway, even in subzero temperatures, and then waits for a bus that takes 40 minutes. One bus driver refuses to pick him up. Swedes holler at him from passing cars, telling him to go home. ""What home?"" he said. ""I have no home."" His first asylum claim was denied. He has filed an appeal. If he loses, he faces deportation. This possibility fills him with dread. If he lands back in Afghanistan, he will be just another jobless young person. In Sweden, he has become a full-time student, nearly fluent in Swedish, and keen to forge a career as an electrician. ""I want to live the way other people live,"" he said. For most Swedes, the benefits of immigration remain intact. The Nordic model is proven, justifying taxpayer investments toward settling refugees, say economists. Many will struggle to work, but their children will grow up speaking Swedish. They will graduate from Swedish schools into jobs. ""Immigration doesn't shake the Swedish welfare model in any way,"" said Mr Claes Hultgren, the municipal manager in Filipstad. ""When we have succeeded with these people, this is a huge resource for Sweden."" The average refugee in Sweden receives about 74,000 Swedish kronor (S$10,700) more in government services than they pay into the system, Mr Joakim Ruist, an economist at the University of Gothenburg, concluded in a report released last year and commissioned by the Ministry of Finance. Overall, the cost of social programmes for refugees runs about 1 per cent of Sweden's annual national economic output, about as much as Sweden now spends on international aid. The economy is growing. The government's finances are solid. ""Sweden can bear this cost,"" Mr Ruist said. ""This seemingly unsolvable refugee crisis is fully solvable."" In Filipstad, refugee families of five and more are packed into apartments built for two. Local schools have seen multiplying reports of concern - anything from students missing class to evidence of hunger. Violent crime is increasing. So is drug use. The job training unit represents an effort to arrest that trajectory. On a recent morning, Ms Saadia Osman sits in a classroom on the second floor of a government building overlooking a lake. She and 11 other refugees are learning Swedish tailored to work in a restaurant kitchen. A mother of three, Ms Osman, 39, arrived in Sweden six years ago, having fled the war in her native Somalia. At first, the government paid the 6,400 kronor a month rent on their two-room apartment. It gave them money for food and clothing. Her husband studied Swedish and attended city-run work trainings. Three years ago, he landed a job at a nearby factory that makes Swedish crisp bread, earning 20,000 kronor a month. They now pay their own rent. Ms Osman, a preschool teacher in Somalia, wants her own job. ""We are all eager to work,"" she said. ""It's not good to sit around at home and do nothing."" But as the local government seeks to multiply such successes, it is operating with a shortage of money. Most refugees can study only part time. ""We don't have the money for more,"" said Mr Fellsman. Three years ago, the national government gave Filipstad 55 million kronor to cover the extra costs of supporting refugees. That money runs out this year. National authorities recently approved plans for an additional US$34 million in aid for local governments, less than initially proposed. Sweden sits at a crossroads. Taxpayers can swallow the costs of integrating refugees, or reject that burden and risk a defining division: White, native-born Swedes will retain jobs and comfortable lives, while dark-skinned immigrants sink into poverty and joblessness in isolated ghettos. ""We are creating more and more hostility in our country,"" said Mr Dan Andersson, a former chief economist at LO. ""We are creating an underclass of unskilled people, because we aren't helping them with resources. From where Mr Johnny Grahn sits, Sweden is already helping too much. A bus driver by profession, he occupies a seat on the Filipstad government council, representing the Sweden Democrats. His face tightens at mention of the refugees. As he describes it, they have overwhelmed the community. The mosque established in the former home of a prominent Swedish conservative intellectual, Sven Stolpe, rudely awakens neighbours with the call to prayer, Mr Grahn complains. Local housing complexes are full of foreigners, he said, while preschools have been ""inundated"" with refugee children. But the greatest indignity is the impact on the local budget, Mr Grahn said. People are waiting weeks to see dentists. The council recently cut a popular activity coordinator at a local senior centre. At the same time, the local government's welfare payments have soared over the past decade from 6 million kronor to 29 million. To Mr Grahn and his allies in the Sweden Democrat party, the takeaway is obvious: Refugees are absorbing an outsize share of resources, leaving less money for everyone else. ""The services that you pay taxes for have been reduced drastically,"" he said. ""There is almost a collapse in the system. When there are so many people arriving who don't work, the whole thing falls apart."" In fact, public dismay over cuts to government programmes is an old story in Sweden, one that long predates the recent influx of refugees. After an economic crisis in the early 1990s, Sweden lowered taxes and reduced spending, trimming unemployment benefits and pensions. Complaints about delays in the health care system have become legion, with wealthier people resorting to private insurance. But that picture is complicated, involving history, the changing ideological whims of the electorate and the complexities of national programmes. In Filipstad, as in other communities, a simpler, readily identified culprit now takes blame for nearly every social problem - the refugees. Driving the narrative is an assumption shared widely among Sweden Democrats that money spent trying to integrate refugees is money wasted. ""We are taking in people who don't want to learn Swedish and don't want to enter society,"" said Mr Grahn. ""Integration isn't just about us helping them. They have to want it."" Beyond Sweden, this sort of thinking tears at the foundations of the Nordic model in an era of mass migration. ""People's willingness to continue paying the very high taxes needed to finance the social welfare programs is not something that can be taken for granted,"" said Mr Blix, the economist. ""We are now beginning to see the emergence of some serious cracks."" To outsiders, the Nordic model may seem governed by benevolence, by a collectivist spirit that places value on ensuring that no one goes without fundamental needs like health care and housing. But Sweden's experience with refugees suggests a more pragmatic, even transactional conception of the social welfare state, a sort of membership club in which people pay dues for expected services. If too many people get the benefits for free - especially people who stand out as different from the majority - faith in the system is imperiled.","{'neg': 0.08, 'neu': 0.828, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': 0.9767}",0.9767
South Africa former president Jacob Zuma to testify at graft scandal inquiry,Jul 13 2019,"JOHANNESBURG (AFP) - South African former president Jacob Zuma is due on Monday (July 15) to make a much-anticipated appearance before   after previous witnesses gave damning evidence against him. Mr Zuma is accused of overseeing mass looting of state funds during his nine-year reign before he was ousted in 2018 by the ruling ANC party and replaced by Mr Cyril Ramaphosa. Mr Zuma, 77, has denied all wrongdoing, and his lawyers have described the inquiry as an attempt to ""ambush and humiliate"" him. The former president, who is not legally required to appear, agreed to attend for up to five days this week, though it is unclear if he will cooperate with any cross-examination. His request to see the questions in advance was denied by the inquiry commission, which is probing the corruption scandal known as ""state capture"". ""In all honesty, the commission asked me to come to testify and put forward any information that I might have,"" Mr Zuma said on Friday, ahead of the televised hearings. ""We will see how things pan out, but I am going there."" The inquiry commission said last month that Mr Zuma was invited to appear ""to enable him to give his side of the story"". Led by judge Raymond Zondo, the probe is investigating a web of deals involving government officials, the wealthy Gupta family and state-owned companies. According to one witness at the commission, Mr Zuma allegedly accepted a monthly US$2,200 (S$2,900) bribe delivered in luxury bags from a security firm that was trying to evade police investigation. The money was in theory for his charity foundation. Former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene, who was sacked by Mr Zuma in 2015, testified that Mr Zuma pushed policies on nuclear power and aviation that were designed to benefit the Gupta family. The Gupta brothers are accused of fraudulently profiting from vast government contracts including energy and transport deals under Mr Zuma. The Guptas owned a uranium mine, which would have seen profits soar from the nuclear deal, as well as a portfolio of mining, technology and media companies. They allegedly held such sway over Mr Zuma that they were able to select some of his cabinet ministers. Former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas told the inquiry that the Guptas offered him the finance minister's job and even threatened to kill him after he refused to accept a US$40 million bribe. The Financial Mail weekly said on Thursday that Mr Zuma's lawyer Daniel Mantsha had stopped communicating with the inquiry's officials ahead of Mr Zuma's testimony. Mr Mantsha has previously told the commission that Mr Zuma was keen to appear in front of a ""truly independent"" forum to ""expose lies"" about him. Mr Zuma was forced to set up the commission in January 2018, shortly before he left office, after failing in a legal battle to overturn the instructions of the country's ethics ombudsman. It has been holding hearings in Johannesburg since last year. Mr Zuma has also been charged with 16 counts of graft linked to an arms deal from before he became president.","{'neg': 0.099, 'neu': 0.819, 'pos': 0.081, 'compound': -0.7963}",-0.7963
'This is wrong': Students recall Jeffrey Epstein's conduct with teen girls at New York private school,Jul 13 2019,"NEW YORK (NYTIMES) - In the mid-1970s, students at one of New York's most esteemed prep schools were surprised to encounter a new teacher who pushed the limits on the school's strict dress code, wandering the halls in a fur coat, gold chains and an open shirt that exposed his chest. The teacher, Jeffrey Epstein, would decades later face allegations that he coerced and trafficked teenagers for sex. At the Dalton School on the Upper East Side, some students saw Epstein as an unusual and unsettling figure, willing to violate the norms in his encounters with girls. Eight former students who attended the prestigious school during Epstein's short tenure there said his conduct with teenage girls left an impression that lingered for decades. One former student recalled him showing up at a party where students were drinking, while most remembered his persistent attention on the girls in hallways and classrooms. ""I can remember thinking at the time, 'This is wrong,'"" said Scott Spizer, who graduated from Dalton in 1976. None of the female students who spoke to The New York Times in recent days remembered Epstein making unwanted physical contact with them, and he has not been accused of any crimes related to his time at the school. But a few students said they had been discomfited by a close relationship he had with one of their female peers, a concern that had escalated so much that one of them had raised the issue then to a school administrator. Dalton has long been known for its rigorous academics, repeatedly ranking among the nation's best private schools while drawing the sons and daughters of New York titans of finance, media and art. Among the alumni are CNN journalist Anderson Cooper, actress Claire Danes and comedian Chevy Chase. Epstein's time at Dalton was brief, and an administrator said it ended in a dismissal. While Epstein later developed a reputation in the world of finance as a man of brilliance - ""He was a Brooklyn guy with a motor for a brain,"" New York magazine wrote in a 2002 profile - the administrator told The Times that he had dismissed Epstein for poor performance. But the accounts offer a window into Epstein's early adulthood, before he developed extensive private wealth that allowed him to acquire a US$56 million (S$76 million) mansion just a mile south of the Dalton School. It was there, prosecutors said this week, that Epstein and his employees paid ""numerous"" underage girls to engage in sex acts with him. Federal prosecutors in New York on Monday (July 8) charged Epstein, 66, with sex trafficking. He has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. Officials with the Dalton School also did not respond to requests for comment, but news of the charges have led alumni to reconnect and swap memories of a young teacher who sometimes seemed to defy the expectations of behaviour for an authority figure. Like much of the rest of the country, the Dalton School in the 1970s was in the midst of an culture war. The school, which had been a progressive haven for the children of artists and writers, was undergoing a shift under a new headmaster. Donald Barr, the father of Attorney General William Barr, came in as a disciplinarian, focused on beefing up the academics of the school and enforcing a strict code of conduct. In a school known for creativity, administrators prohibited denim jeans and ""bizarre and eccentric costumes"". If Barr caught students using marijuana, he would often send them to therapy as a condition of staying in the school. He himself described his leadership style as ""by em ukase /em ,"" using the Imperial Russian term for an edict from the czar. Staff members would sometimes turn students away from their morning classes: girls for skirts that were too short, and boys for hair that was too long. Some students and parents balked against the constraints. Still, the school continued to draw past and future families of fame. Around the years of Epstein's tenure, records show the student roster included Prudence Murdoch, the daughter of the media mogul Rupert Murdoch; fashion designer Jill Stuart; and several future actresses, including Jennifer Grey, Tracy Pollan and Maggie Wheeler. While Barr was strict on the school culture, he made it a point to hire teachers from unconventional backgrounds, recalled Susan Semel, a social studies teacher at Dalton from the 1960s to 1980s who later wrote a book on the history of the school. ""Barr didn't care about credentials as long as you were interesting and knew your stuff,"" Semel said. Epstein, from Brooklyn, was still in his early 20s when he was hired at Dalton, arriving without a college degree. The New York magazine profile reported that Epstein worked at the school starting in 1973, but the school's yearbooks do not show him as a teacher until the 1974-75 academic year. In February 1974, Barr announced he was resigning as headmaster, protesting the meddling by the board of trustees. A year after Barr's departure, under the leadership of Gardner Dunnan, the school tentatively explored a rollback of some of the strict rules. Dunnan announced a policy in early 1975 that would allow denim inside the building. But students still had to wear clothes that were neat and clean. In the years since, however, Dunnan has faced his own allegations of inappropriate conduct. A former Dalton student said in a lawsuit that she was invited to live with Dunnan at age 14 and suffered repeated sexual assaults under his care. Dunnan denies the allegations. The lawsuit was dropped, but the woman's lawyers said they intended to refile it. At Dalton, Epstein was known as a charismatic, young teacher who at times acted more like a friend than an authority figure to students. The urban school inside a brick building did not have outdoor spaces to congregate, so the students gathered in halls and rooms that spanned the building's many stories. That included lab rooms dedicated to various subjects, providing a more informal and intimate setting for students to get help outside of class from their teachers. It was in one of these lab rooms that Leslie Kitziger, who graduated from Dalton in 1978, first met Epstein. Kitziger remembered him as a flamboyant dresser and lively jokester. ""He was goofy and like a kid himself,"" she recalled. Kitziger said she became close to Epstein at a time when she was struggling at home with her parent's divorce. She confided in him, and remembered him as caring and attentive. ""He listened,"" Kitziger recalled. ""I was a 14-year-old and he helped me through a time when there wasn't anybody else to talk to. I felt like he really cared that I was having a rough go."" She stressed that Epstein was always professional with her. But other students, including Millicent Young, a graduate of the school's 1976 class, saw things differently. She never had Epstein as a teacher, but the school was small enough that she would spend time around him. She recalled observing Epstein flirting with the girls at the school, which drew her attention because it was so different from how other teachers behaved. ""There was a real clarity of the inappropriateness of the behaviour - that this isn't how adult male teachers conduct themselves,"" Young said. Spizer, the fellow student who graduated the same year, said he had a clear recollection of disliking Epstein because he was spending so much time with girls in the school. Some other students spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing retribution from Epstein. One recalled him making efforts to get her to spend time with him outside of school, and she recalled raising concerns about Epstein's conduct with another student to Dunnan. An attorney for Dunnan said the former headmaster was not aware of any concerns about Epstein's conduct at the school. Another student, who also requested anonymity, fearing reprisals from Epstein, recalled seeing Epstein at a high school party in an apartment on the Upper East Side where students were drinking and socializing. Epstein was the only teacher there, which raised eyebrows among the students. ""It was weird,"" said another former student, Paul Grossman, a 1978 graduate who did not attend the party but remembered talking to students about it. ""Everyone talked about it."" Peter Thomas Roth, who graduated from Dalton in 1975 and later founded a cosmetics and skin care company with his name, said Epstein was such a ""brilliant"" teacher that his father later hired him to tutor Roth in statistics. Roth said he never heard of any rumours about misconduct at the school.","{'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.878, 'pos': 0.072, 'compound': 0.9805}",0.9805
Spackman to buy South Korean film production company for $3.3m in shares,Jul 15 2019,"SINGAPORE - Catalist-listed film producer and investor Spackman Entertainment Group is looking to buy the entire stake in South Korean film production company Simplex Films for $3.3 million in new Spackman shares. In a bourse filing on Monday morning, Spackman said it had entered into a sale and purchase agreement with four independent third parties to acquire a 100 per cent interest in Hong Kong-incorporated Simplex Films. Simplex wholly owns South Korea-founded film production firm Simplex Films Co, which is headed by veteran South Korean producer Lim Ji-young. The total purchase consideration will be 165 million new shares in Spackman, at two Singapore cents apiece. This works out to a price tag of around $3.3 million. The issue price of two cents represents a premium of 17.6 per cent to the stock's volume weighted average price of 1.7 cents per share based on trades done on July 12. Spackman said the purchase price was arrived at after arm's length negotiations and reviewing the average of Spackman's past one month's volume weighted average price of about 1.8 cents and taking into account, among other things, Simplex's unaudited net profit before tax of 72.3 million South Korean won (S$83,300) for the period from Jan 1 to May 31, 2019. The new Spackman shares, when allotted and issued, will represent about 13.8 per cent of the enlarged share capital upon completion of the acquisition.

By signing up, you agree to our   and  Spackman said the proposed acquisition is in line with its strategy of ""aggressively"" looking out for acquisitions that can add accretive value to the group's existing film production business, and will allow the sharing of networks and resources. The acquisition is subject to condition precedents such as the veracity of warranty, completion of Spackman's due-diligence exercise including the valuation of Simplex, regulatory approvals and the consent of the boards of directors of Simplex and Spackman. Mr John Ko, chief executive of Spackman, said the proposed acquisition will expand its annual film production capacity and have a positive contribution within this fiscal year from Simplex's maiden film. Simplex's upcoming film, Jesters: The Game Changers, is a historical comedy starring Cho Jin-woong and Son Hyun-joo, and is set to be released in August 2019 in South Korea. Now in the post-production stage, the film is distributed by Warner Bros Korea and directed by Kim Joo-ho. Spackman said Simplex plans to produce films to be theatrically released and distributed in South Korea and overseas. Simplex will first release its films in South Korea and subsequently in post-theatrical markets such as cable television, broadcast television, Internet Protocol television (IPTV), video on demand, and home video or DVD. Spackman said the proposed acquisition will enable the group to be ""better positioned to invest in Simplex's pipeline of high-quality films in terms of script and casting to seek higher returns as both a film producer and an investor"". Simplex has the following tentative pipeline of films: A Bolt From The Blue, Irrevocable Promise, Our Superstar K, Happy Murder, Girl Crush and Temptation. A Bolt From The Blue is scheduled to start production in 2019. It will be directed by Kim Ji-mok and is a remake of a 2014 Japanese comedy drama. Spackman is an entertainment production group founded by media investor Charles Spackman, with offices in Seoul and Singapore. The company is primarily engaged in the independent development, production, presentation and financing of theatrical motion pictures in South Korea. It also produces South Korean television dramas. Besides its content business, Spackman invests in entertainment companies and film funds. Last week, the company announced that its subsidiary Zip Cinema will start filming its next major film in the second half of 2019. The movie, Alone, is headlined by actor Yoo Ah-in and actress Park Shin-hye. ","{'neg': 0.015, 'neu': 0.883, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': 0.9946}",0.9946

"Growth slumps to 27-year low in China, with talk of more aggressive stimulus measures",Jul 15 2019,"BEIJING - China's economy grew 6.2 per cent in the second quarter of this year, its slowest rate in 27 years, as the country's trade war with the United States exacted its toll.Danson Cheong Analysts said they expect economic growth to continue to weaken for the rest of this year, which would likely prompt more aggressive stimulus measures from Beijing. Data released on Monday (July 15) by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that gross domestic product growth in the second quarter had slowed from 6.4 per cent in the first quarter of this year, coming in largely within expectations. The economy grew by 6.3 per cent for the first half of the year, according to the NBS. The figure is still within the 6 to 6.5 per cent target that Beijing has set for full year GDP growth. Last year, China's economy grew by a reported 6.6 per cent. Economists are closely watching the performance of the world's second largest economy as the trade war continues, dragging down other economies, including Singapore, whose second quarter economic growth has slumped to 0.1 per cent. Speaking at a briefing on Monday (Jul 15), NBS spokesman Mao Shengyong said despite the slowdown, China's economy performed within a “reasonable range”. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  “Global growth is slowing, the external environment is more complicated than in the past. We are focusing our energy on restructuring and upgrading industries,” he said, when asked about what impact the trade war was having on the economy. But data released on Monday also showed several bright spots. Domestic consumption, as indicated by retail sales, rose 9.8 per cent in June from a year earlier. This is up from 8.6 per cent in May and 7.2 per cent in April - the lowest figure since 2003. Industrial production in June also grew 6.3 per cent year on year, 1.3 percentage points faster than in May, when it had slumped to a 17-year low. Peking University finance professor Michael Pettis said GDP growth has slowed because of the trade war, and Beijing's efforts to control debt levels. One thing to watch for going forward is whether growth numbers pick up – this would be a sign that Beijing is unleashing stimulus measures to boost the economy which could also worsen existing debt risks, he said. “The numbers (today) are not surprising, what really matters is how Beijing will react to the numbers,” said Prof Pettis. Tsinghua University economist Yuan Gangming said he expects economic growth in the third and final quarter will continue to fall, estimating full-year growth to come in at 6.2 per cent. Domestic concerns will likely pose greater downward pressure on the economy, he said: “As China makes adjustments to restructure and upgrade industries, this process will also cause economic growth to slow down.” Monday's data follows trade figures released last week, which showed that exports and imports had dipped in June following an escalation of the trade war in May which saw heightened tariffs imposed on Chinese goods. Although both US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met at the G-20 in Osaka and declared a trade war truce, tariffs remain on the US$360 billion worth of goods from both sides, while trade talks get underway. Beijing has so far leaned largely on supply-side stimulus to drive growth. This year it has announced massive tax cuts of almost 2 trillion yuan (S$395 billion) for businesses. Policymakers have already pledged to take further action. Premier Li Keqiang said at a state council meeting this month that the government would lower tariffs and increase tax rebates to support exporters. But analysts say the bright spots in June were unlikely to endure, which could prompt the government to roll out stimulus measures to boost demand and drive growth. A research note by Fitch Solutions Macro Research on Monday said the economic slowdown could result in wage cuts and job losses which would weigh down domestic consumption. Beijing would likely move to mitigate this, they said: “We believe that the government will soon announce concrete measures in an effort to boost demand, and in particular disposable incomes of rural and urban residents.” ","{'neg': 0.082, 'neu': 0.834, 'pos': 0.084, 'compound': -0.2297}",-0.2297

Giving more details on the Citizens' Panel on Work-Life Harmony, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said on Monday that it will allow different viewpoints to be exchanged, such as between employers and employees, ""so that we can see challenges and concerns from the other party's point of view, and we can also then ask what are reasonable ways forward that will help to improve workplace norms"". ""Given how much time we spend at work, having the right culture in the workplace will make a lot of difference. ""But this is also one area where government policies alone cannot change or shift, and at the end of the day, what matters is that you have a set of workplace norms that everyone supports and agrees on,"" she told reporters during a visit to Grand Park City Hall hotel, where flexible work arrangements for staff are practised. Mrs Teo, who oversees population matters and is leading the panel, said that for the initiative to be effective, it must involve people who represent a diversity of views and have a balance of different voices.

The Government will review the recommendations and respond early next year. The panel was first announced by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat in June. NPTD said the two main aims are to identify underlying factors and gain deeper insights into issues that affect Singaporeans' work-life harmony, in the context of supporting families; and to identify trade-offs and develop solutions, including those that can be taken directly by business owners, supervisors and workers, to create conditions for work-life harmony here. All Singaporeans aged 21 and above can apply to be on the panel. The people selected will include full-time and part-time workers, people with different marital status, parents and those with other caregiving responsibilities. People interested to join can apply at   or call 6516-5603 from today until July 31. Selected participants will be informed by early September. Panel members will have to commit to all four Saturday sessions, which are from 9.30am to 5pm. Besides having small group discussions, they will also be able to call on subject-matter experts such as human resource professionals and organisations that work with families to inform their recommendations. The NPTD said the panel is based on the Citizens' Jury process invented by American political scientist Ned Crosby in 1971, and the concept has been used to discuss issues ranging from the economy and federal debt in the United States, the sharing of health records in Britain, and compulsory third-party insurance in Australia.

High-level committee finds shortfalls in public sector's data security practices,Jul 15 2019,"SINGAPORE - Public-sector agencies have insufficient policies governing third parties handling data and there are inconsistent practices in managing data access, a high-level committee currently reviewing and strengthening data security practices across the entire public service has found.Hariz Baharudin The Public Sector Data Security Review Committee, which was convened by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and is chaired by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, has conducted a six-week-long government-wide stocktake of data management practices after it was announced in April. The committee, which includes four ministers and experts from the private sector, has till Nov 30 to submit its findings and recommendations to PM Lee. In a briefing on Monday (July 15), the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO) said the committee also found that in the public sector, there are currently varying levels of training in data protection, and that many data incidents have previously been the result of human error where well-meaning staff had inadvertently compromised data. An analysis of emerging trends by the committee also found that the increasing prevalence of data sharing and the growing availability of complex analytics tools heighten the chances of a data breach. Said the SNDGO in a statement: ""There is a need to strengthen our data security regime for the future. This is in view of the increasing complexity of our systems, the greater demand for the use of data to provide convenient digital services to the public and the need to use data for better policymaking."" Besides the stocktake, SNDGO said the committee is also carrying out in-depth inspections of key government agencies' information technology systems. It is doing this in waves, and has looked at the systems in some of the organisations in the finance and healthcare sectors in the first wave. These agencies are: the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, the Central Provident Fund Board, the Ministry of Health, the Health Promotion Board and the Health Sciences Authority. The committee has so far carried out two meetings since it was announced in April: one on April 18 and another on July 1. It was previously announced that the committee comprises 10 people, and that its members were chosen for their experience and expertise in how technology and data security are applied in their respective fields. The committee is also supported by a separate expert group consisting of seven international experts and industry professionals. In addition to this expert group, the committee is supported by an inter-agency task force formed by public officers across the Government. The formation of the committee follows a spate of cyber and data security breaches and incidents over the past year. The latest data breach involved the personal information of more than 800,000 blood donors being improperly put online for more than two months.

Former president Jacob Zuma says he's a victim as he faces South African graft probe,Jul 15 2019,"JOHANNESBURG () - Former South African President Jacob Zuma rejected a slew of allegations that he aided and abetted graft during his almost nine years in office and claimed he was the victim of a conspiracy by foreign and domestic intelligence agencies intent on ousting and discrediting him. ""I have been the subject of talk in this country for more than a decade. I have been vilified, alleged to be the king of corrupt people and the most corrupt,"" Zuma said on Monday (July 15) at a judicial panel set up to probe the corruption allegations. ""I have been provoked and provoked to the last degree."" Ex-Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan estimates that more than 100 billion rand (S$9.8 billion) may have been stolen while Zuma led Africa's most-industrialised economy. A number of previous witnesses, including ex-members of his executive and government officials, have told the panel Zuma took bribes from businessmen and allowed members of the wealthy Gupta family to influence who was awarded Cabinet posts and state contracts. Zuma hit back during the public hearings, saying there is no concrete evidence to prove he ever did anything wrong. While he admitted he was friends with the Guptas and suggested they set up a newspaper and television station, he said there was nothing untoward in their interactions. ""I have never done anything with them unlawfully,"" Zuma said. ""I have wondered why I am accused, why people think my relationship with them is not right."" The three Gupta brothers - Ajay, Atul and Rajesh - were in business with one of Zuma's sons and made headlines after they secured permission to land a plane carrying guests to a family wedding at a military base in 2013. The Guptas, who deny wrongdoing, have left South Africa and have been seen in India and Dubai. They have refused to return to the country to testify. Zuma's most startling revelation was an allegation that Mr Ngoako Ramatlhodi, who served as his mines minister and public-service minister from 2014 to 2017, had been recruited as a spy for the apartheid regime while he was a student in neighbouring Lesotho, but gave no evidence to substantiate the claim. Mr Ramatlhodi told the commission in November that the Guptas exerted an inexplicable influence over Zuma, humiliated him and exploited their relationship with him and his son to further their business interests.

"India, Russia seek to skirt US sanction risk on arms",Jul 15 2019,"NEW DELHI () - India and Russia have agreed on a new payment method through their national currencies for multi-billion-dollar defence deals, in a bid to avoid risks created by the US threat of sanctions and banking restrictions. The arrangement would enable India to pay the first instalment soon for two warships that Russia is building for its navy, two people familiar with the matter said in New Delhi, without elaborating. Defence contracts will be settled in roubles and rupees under a payment agreement reached by the central banks of Russia and India, said a person in Moscow with knowledge of the preparations. While the new mechanism potentially opens the way for releasing billions of dollars in contract payments to Russia, it may still be dependent on India winning agreement from US President Donald Trump not to impose sanctions in retaliation. Russia has faced an uphill struggle to maintain sales by its strategic defence sector, which totalled US$19 billion (S$25.76 billion) last year, partly because of US sanctions that threaten anyone who buys Russian weapons. Even though the US has applied those only once so far - against China - the fear has cast a pall over Russia's export business. The world's second-largest arms exporter after the US, Russia suffered a 17 per cent drop in foreign weapons deals from 2014 to 2018 amid declining purchases by India and Venezuela, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. An increasingly important US partner, India also has long-time strategic ties with Moscow dating back to the Soviet era in the Cold War. Despite the decline in sales, Russia accounted for 58 per cent of the south Asian nation's arms imports from 2014 to 2018. The US has been pushing New Delhi, unsuccessfully so far, to cancel a more than US$5 billion contract to buy Russian advanced S-400 air-defence missile systems, brandishing the threat of punitive measures. Still, India is attempting to obtain a US presidential waiver for its arms purchases. Turkey, a North Atlantic Treaty Organisation member state, is facing the threat of US sanctions over its S-400 purchase from Russia, which began delivery on Friday. Delivery of the S-400 to India is planned to start after 2020 and ""issues with payment have been resolved"", the Russian Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation said last month, according to the state-run Tass news service. Promsvyazbank PJSC, a government-controlled Russian lender that has been tasked with financing the defence industry to shield the two biggest state-owned banks Sberbank and VTB from the threat of US sanctions, is ready to play a role in the Indian transactions, the person in Moscow said. India's S-400 deal signed in October is among agreements with Russia that are cumulatively worth US$10 billion. They include joint production of Kamov Ka-226T helicopters worth US$1 billion, and four warships for the Indian Navy, with two of the vessels built in Russia and two at a shipyard in India under a technology-transfer agreement. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March inaugurated a rifle plant in Amethi that will produce 750,000 Kalashnikov AK-203 rifles under a joint venture between India and Russia. After the US sanctioned Russian state arms exporter Rosoboronexport in late 2017, the State Bank of India stopped payments to Russia for Indian arms purchases, a person familiar with the matter said. The 2017 Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, called CAATSA, requires the imposition of sanctions on persons and entities that knowingly engaged in a significant transaction with Russia's defence or intelligence sectors. The US State Department decides whether a transaction is significant under the legislation, while the 2019 National Defence Authorisation Act provides for a presidential waiver from sanctions. Junior Foreign Minister Vellamvelly Muraleedharan on Wednesday told the Indian Parliament that the country's need for the S-400 had been ""clearly conveyed"" to the US during Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's visit in June. The Bank of Russia didn't respond to a request for comment. The State Bank of India and Promsvyazbank didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for India's Ministry of Defence declined to comment. VTB late last month denied an Indian media report that it would process Indian payments in euros for the arms purchases, avoiding use of the dollar. ""It was clear from the beginning that it wouldn't work either in euros because the global financial system is so dependent on the US that no one will dare to do this,"" said Mr Ruslan Pukhov, head of the Centre of Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a defence industry consultant in Moscow. ""Russia is trying to resurrect practices we had in Soviet times by clearing in rupees and roubles,"" Mr Pukhov said. A waiver from Mr Trump ""is unlikely as it would set an unsustainable precedent"", said Mr Scott Jones, whose US-based TradeSecure consultancy advises governments on arms export controls and sanctions.","{'neg': 0.081, 'neu': 0.846, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': -0.8901}",-0.8901
"Q2 growth slumps; full-year recession not expected, says Heng Swee Keat",Jul 13 2019,"Singapore's economic growth in the second quarter slumped to its worst showing in a decade, far below what analysts had anticipated.Seow Bei Yi Growth slowed to 0.1 per cent in the second quarter, according to flash estimates by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI). Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, however, put out word yesterday that a full-year recession is not on the cards at this point. Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, said in a Facebook post that the Republic is ""prepared for the cycles the economy will go through"" and the authorities are working with employers and unions to prepare for all scenarios. For now, he does not expect a recession in which the economy for 2019 will shrink compared with the year before, he said. Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing added in a separate Facebook post that Singapore remains confident its fundamentals will help it ride out current challenges despite near-term headwinds. The country's investment pipeline keeps it assured that it is on the right track, he added, even as the economy saw its slowest growth since it contracted by 1.2 per cent in the second quarter of 2009, during the Great Recession. The latest quarterly figure was a far cry from the revised 1.1 per cent expansion last quarter, which analysts expected would be matched this time.

They pointed to a deeper technical recession - or two consecutive quarters of slowdown - which could hit employment growth and worsen retrenchments. HSBC economist Joseph Incalcaterra called the latest quarterly figure a ""harbinger of further growth deterioration across the region"". On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, Singapore's economy shrank 3.4 per cent, changing course from its 3.8 per cent growth in the three months before. There was weakness across all key sectors, which contracted from the first quarter. Mr Incalcaterra said: ""What surprised us is how broad-based the deterioration was in Singapore, suggesting that unlike other neighbouring economies, domestic-facing sectors are not strong enough to offset external headwinds."" Manufacturing was the key drag, shrinking 3.8 per cent from the previous year and 6 per cent from the last quarter. ING chief economist Robert Carnell said the manufacturing dip this time has ""strong drivers"", with Singapore's highly export-driven economy leaving it very exposed to the trade war between the United States and China, as well as the broader slowdown in world trade. The risk of a technical recession looks to be growing, said Ms Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC Bank. Maybank Kim Eng economist Chua Hak Bin added that a deeper technical recession could hit employment growth and worsen retrenchments in manufacturing and trade-related services. Ms Ling noted an ""emerging softening"" in services, which grew 1.2 per cent year on year this time compared with 2.9 per cent this time last year. This suggests consumer confidence may be dented and people are tightening their purse strings. ""Given the importance of the service sector as a jobs engine, we are wary if this could start to impact hiring intentions if sentiments remain lacklustre into the second half of the year,"" she said. Ms Ling added that the odds now are higher that the Republic's central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), will ease monetary policy in October, a move that could help Singapore exports. A  poll yesterday found that seven in 11 economists expect MAS to loosen policy in October, with four others forecasting no change. Some, like Mr Carnell, believe an imminent move is probable, as waiting would put the economy ""in greater than necessary jeopardy"". Policymakers here are already reviewing their 1.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent growth forecast for the year, and some like Dr Chua expect the MTI to downgrade the range to 0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent.

Preacher's appeals filed before PH took office,Jul 13 2019,"Malaysia's top prosecutor, responding to criticism after a Muslim preacher lost his appeal and was jailed under the controversial Sedition Act that the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government has vowed to repeal, yesterday said the appeals in the case were lodged before PH came to power. Giving the timeline of the case against Wan Ji Wan Hussin, who was convicted of insulting the Selangor Sultan, Attorney-General Tommy Thomas said both the preacher and the public prosecutor decided to appeal against the nine-month jail sentence handed down by the Sessions Court in April last year. This was prior to the May 9 general election, which saw the PH coalition end the six-decade rule of the Barisan Nasional (BN). On Tuesday, the country's High Court dismissed Wan Ji's appeal against conviction and, in allowing the prosecution's cross-appeal against the sentence, increased his jail term to one year. The court's decision resulted in Wan Ji, a member of the ruling Parti Keadilan Rakyat, becoming the first person to be jailed under the Sedition Act in the PH administration. It came under fire from both civil society and members of the ruling PH who wanted an explanation from the A-G. They also called for the Mahathir Mohamad administration to fulfil its repeated promise to do away with the Sedition Act. Critics say the Act has been used by the previous BN government to stifle dissent. The preacher was released on bail yesterday. Wan Ji was a former religious adviser to Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng when Mr Lim was Penang's chief minister. While Mr Thomas acknowledged that repealing the law was one of Pakatan's electoral promises, he added that ""the Cabinet has not informed Chambers of any decision to repeal or amend it"". Neither has there been any instruction not to use the Sedition Act as that ""discretionary power under the Constitution (is) vested solely in the office of the Attorney-General"", he added. But he pointed out that not a single person has been charged under the Sedition Act since last year's general election. Referring to Wan Ji's appeal, Mr Thomas said the Attorney-General's Chambers was studying the options open to it, but noted that given the preacher's conviction by two courts, ""the margin of discretion in his office is substantially limited"".","{'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.904, 'pos': 0.03, 'compound': -0.8957}",-0.8957
IPS report urges better end-of-life planning,Jul 13 2019,"When it comes to talking about death and dying, Singaporeans uncharacteristically leave things to the last minute.Linette Lai But this has to change as the country ages, with a robust national plan needed to prepare people for their final days, the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) recommended in a comprehensive new report yesterday. ""As Singaporeans, we plan for almost everything, from the first house that we purchase to a child's first school,"" said IPS research associate Yvonne Arivalagan, one of the study's authors. ""But this is a really important aspect of life that very few people actually plan for."" The 97-page report highlighted aspects of end-of-life care where gaps remain and recommended improvements, including in the areas of costs, family support, and the ease of planning and communicating one's final wishes. It is based on the findings of a group of experts from various fields, who studied the issue over a two-year period. ""We find that one of the most common scenarios is that people just don't talk about this until it's too late,"" Ms Arivalagan added. ""At that moment, it's very distressing and there are a lot of financial considerations to think about... The idea is to talk about this issue much earlier."" A Lien Foundation survey in 2014 found that 77 per cent of people preferred to die at home. But data from last year's Singapore Demographic Bulletins showed that only 24 per cent achieved this, with 63 per cent dying in hospitals. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  And although Singapore tops the world in life expectancy, with the average Singaporean enjoying the longest span of living in good health, there has also been a rise in the number of unhealthy years lived by people here. When it came to costs, the report's authors noted that people may find it cheaper to die in a hospital than at home, simply because of how government subsidies are structured. Financing programmes for end-of-life care services are also less developed than in the rest of the healthcare system, since most care is informal and provided by families and the community. In fact, healthcare costs can be the source of familial rifts, especially when patients decline treatment so that their loved ones will not have to shoulder the burden of their medical bills. IPS senior research fellow Christopher Gee, who co-authored the study, noted that Singapore has traditionally invested heavily in acute hospitals and less in long-term care. Although this is changing, subsidies are still skewed towards the old model, he said. ""It's not easy to level this up. But going forward, we will need to think about how we can incentivise people to seek care at home or in the community, rather than in the hospital, because that's a big reason why so many of us end up dying there."" At the same time, the authors noted that families often have a ""culture of silence"" when it comes to end-of-life issues, making it difficult for the tough conversations about a person's care preferences to take place. For instance, a critically ill person may not want to inform family members of a poor diagnosis in order to avoid upsetting them, or vice versa. Others may have a superstitious aversion to talking about death, or may be reluctant to dampen a loved one's will to live. These cultural and emotional barriers must be tackled in any programme dealing with end-of-life issues, the study's authors said. They also pointed out that there needs to be more awareness of advance care plans and the Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) scheme, which help a person's family make decisions according to their wishes if they are no longer able to do so. While advance care plans serve as guides to a person's treatment preferences, LPAs are legally binding documents through which one can appoint someone to make decisions for them, should they lose mental capacity. Documentation processes for these and other related services could be merged under a single administrative body, simplifying matters for families, the authors suggested. On a national level, schools, workplaces and even religious organisations can encourage people to start conversations on these issues and normalise them as part of life, they added.

Key recommendations,Jul 13 2019,"The law forbids Lasting Power of Attorney-appointed donees, who are most likely the family members, from making decisions about the life-sustaining treatment of a mentally incapacitated loved one. If the patient has not stated his wishes in advance through advance care planning (ACP), for instance, the decision to preserve his life or take him off life support lies with the doctor. ACP facilitators should discuss the Act's restrictions with family members and ask the elderly about their preferences. Culture and religion influence each patient's perceptions of death and his final days. Religious institutions could help to design relevant spiritual care programmes for patients in hospices. The Institute of Policy Studies researchers said it is time to normalise end-of-life topics and not shy away from them. These topics can be raised at milestone events such as attaining adulthood, marriage, childbirth and retirement, or while getting life insurance. The researchers said government medical subsidies are skewed towards treating medical conditions and covering healthcare services, while long-term care services are financed by a small group of voluntary or charitable organisations. Hence, patients choose to die in hospitals rather than at home, since subsidies push people to seek hospitalisation for their long-term care needs. The researchers also said more doctors, allied health professionals and medical specialists should be trained in palliative care.","{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.81, 'pos': 0.12, 'compound': 0.9099}",0.9099

The lower earnings were also due to higher operating expenses, which rose 5.5 per cent to $220 million on the back of increased operational costs given an enlarged student accommodation portfolio and SPH Reit. There were also higher financing costs and professional fees, said SPH yesterday. Investment income fell 82 per cent to $4 million as the treasury and investment portfolio was largely divested by the end of the previous financial year.

Laid-off expat bankers in HK struggle to find new jobs,Jul 13 2019,"HONG KONG • For years, Hong Kong was a hot spot with plum jobs for overseas bankers as global firms hired aggressively. But many of the city's recently laid-off bankers are finding that cost-cutting and a demand for Mandarin speakers have diminished the opportunities for expatriates in Asia's financial hub. After Deutsche Bank announced wide-ranging cuts this week, many employees worldwide are facing the challenge of job-hunting in a shrinking market. For foreign staff losing positions in Hong Kong, it could be harder than most. At the same time, the city's famously expensive living costs, including some of the world's highest rents, mean even senior bankers need to find new jobs fast in order to stay. The upshot? Expat bankers who lost their jobs and want to remain in Hong Kong have to consider lower-paying options or demotions. Some with longer-running ties to the city are looking at switching careers, weighing everything from consulting to cryptocurrency outfits. During the 2008 global financial crisis, Asian banks and local Chinese firms hired those laid off by foreign players, said Mr Will Glover, Hong Kong-based managing director for recruitment firm Macdonald & Company. That is less likely this year and some of those taking on new jobs may have to take pay cuts, he said. ""You get that volume of people anywhere into a market at one time and inevitably a lot of people will leave the market altogether. There will not be enough opportunities to absorb all that supply."" While global banks are ramping up their focus on China, more of them are looking for people with language skills and networks on the Chinese mainland. A senior banker in Hong Kong, who is in his 50s and was laid off from a European investment bank this year, said he would like to continue to live in the city, where his children go to school. But he expects it to be hard to find a top job because banks are moving people internally or hiring more people locally. His monthly rent is about HK$100,000 (S$17,400), making it essential to find a job soon. It is a dilemma faced by many others. One European banker laid off from a top Asian bank said he took a holiday and is now pondering working in a start-up or even moving out of Hong Kong after 20 years. Deutsche Bank's website until Wednesday said it had more than 1,200 people in Hong Kong, although that figure has since been removed. The bank has cut about half its equities staff in Asia and plans to reduce the group by another 25 per cent within a month, a person familiar with the matter said. A Deutsche Bank employee in Hong Kong, recently laid off, said many of her colleagues plan to stay in the city and are looking at positions in banking, family offices or asset management. She is hoping to use her background in compliance for another job in finance. Former Deutsche Bank employee Su Zhu, who worked at the firm in Hong Kong until 2012 and now runs a Singapore foreign exchange and cryptocurrency fund, said that over the past year, many bankers have gone into the crypto industry. Foreign banks can now choose from a widening pool of young professionals raised in Hong Kong, who speak multiple languages, know Chinese culture, have trained overseas and do not require expensive relocation packages. That makes it harder for foreign bankers in the city, as well as junior professionals attempting to move from overseas, to find new positions in Hong Kong. A British equities trader who lost his job at a US investment bank said he spent almost four months interviewing at banks and hedge funds with no luck. He lost one position to a local candidate 10 years his junior, and is now considering leaving. Expatriate executives in Hong Kong earn US$276,417 (S$375,900) a year on average, including benefits, according to a May report by consultancy ECA International, which analysed salaries from financial and non-financial firms. Average pay scales lagged behind Japan, China and India, although affordable domestic help and a work-friendly visa system for trailing spouses help make Hong Kong attractive. But Hong Kong also topped a recent Deutsche Bank global ranking for the most expensive monthly rents on a two-bedroom apartment, and ranked 39th for disposable income after rent. Senior expats have tended to live in expensive places and send their children to international schools, living off base salaries and saving bonuses, said Mr Benjamin Quinlan, chief executive officer of financial services consultancy Quinlan & Associates in Hong Kong. ""The expat's side of things is going to be significantly harder,"" he said. ""A lot of people are going to have to lower their expectations, even get demoted and take any opportunity they can find, as opposed to waiting out in the market for a magic position to come up again, because it will not.""","{'neg': 0.045, 'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.054, 'compound': 0.8689}",0.8689
Europe faces trade row with US as France taxes Net giants,Jul 13 2019,"France has hit back at the United States government amid a spiralling row on taxes. Earlier this week, the US threatened tariffs and other trade restrictions on the French in retaliation for a new law that will impose taxes on Internet companies, most of which are American. Nicknamed the Gafa tax - an acronym for Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon - the measure, which became law on Thursday after receiving the approval of the French Senate, imposes a 3 per cent charge on the total annual revenues of the largest technology firms providing goods and services to French consumers. ""France is a sovereign country, its decisions on tax matters are sovereign and will continue to be sovereign,"" said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. ""Between allies, I believe we can and must resolve our differences in another way than through threats."" With Britain and a number of other European countries planning to follow France's lead by imposing similar levies, the pressure is mounting on the giants of California's Silicon Valley. And a bigger dispute is unfolding about the very nature of national taxation regimes in an increasingly digitalised world. Although US Internet commerce giants face an increasingly stiff challenge from both regulators and local retailers, they continue to dominate European online markets. In the first quarter of this year, for instance, Amazon's share of French e-commerce went down slightly, but the American retail behemoth still controlled no less than half of France's online trade. And as more trade migrates to online platforms, there is no question that the US retail giants are in a position to consolidate their advantage. The snag is that Internet retailers pay next to no tax on their European profits because they channel almost all their financial transactions through European countries with low corporate tax rates, principally Luxembourg and Ireland. This means that they not only bypass the tax authorities of Britain, France and Germany - where most of their customers are, in Europe - but often do not even have to publicly disclose their tax returns. In Britain and France, for instance, it is estimated that Amazon paid an effective corporate rate tax in the past few years of just 0.1 per cent on its turnover, an astonishing 20 to 30 times less than the tax burden of traditional retailers. And earlier this year, Google won its legal case against a French tax demand of €1.1 billion (S$1.7 billion) for advertising revenue generated in France by successfully persuading judges that its practice of registering profits in Ireland exempted it from French liabilities. Online retail giants have tried to minimise criticism by transferring a share of their business to their big European markets and by arguing that they are hiring lots of people in Europe to handle their operations. Still, the backlash against them is serious. One of the early demands of the so-called Yellow Vest protesters in France, who shook the country's domestic politics, was to tame online retailers. These companies, protesters claimed, were destroying the country's traditional family-run shops. Having failed to generate a Europe-wide consensus on taxing online retailers, France is now leading the way by imposing its own tax regime. The new levy is projected to earn the French authorities up to €500 million a year. And Britain will follow. Mr Boris Johnson, the man most likely to become the country's new prime minister by the end of this month, vows to hit the companies harder. Always eyeing a catchy slogan, he prefers to call his levy a tax on ""Fangs"", an acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. ""We have got to find a way of taxing the Internet giants,"" he said. The new French tax applies only to companies with a global turnover of more than €750 million and a national business in France exceeding €25 million, a bracket which also includes a handful of Chinese, British, German and Spanish retailers. Furthermore, Paris has pledged to drop its tax as soon as an international agreement is reached at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to overhaul decades-old cross-border tax rules for the digital era. Nevertheless, those most likely to be hit by the measure are largely American giants, and the Trump administration in Washington is determined to defend its online operators. A trade dispute therefore looms. Still, the news is not all bad for the giants of Silicon Valley, who have some allies in their corner. Some of Europe's small producers and retailers, who rely on the large Internet platforms to reach their customers, are also unhappy with the new tax.","{'neg': 0.085, 'neu': 0.844, 'pos': 0.072, 'compound': -0.8213}",-0.8213

British police warning to media over diplomat's leaked memos stirs anger,Jul 13 2019,"LONDON () - Senior British politicians, including both contenders to be the next prime minister, joined journalists on Saturday (July 13) in criticising police for warning media not to publish leaked government documents, saying it was a “dangerous road to tread”. Last week, a Sunday newspaper published leaked memos from Britain's Washington ambassador that provoked a serious diplomatic spat with U.S. President Donald Trump and ultimately led to the envoy announcing his resignation. Britain's most senior counter-terrorism officer, Neil Basu, said on Friday police would investigate who was responsible but also warned journalists and publishers they too could be in breach of the law if further documents were leaked. His comments provoked anger and criticism from journalists, editors and politicians who said it risked infringing the freedom of the press. The Society of Editors described it as a heavy-handed approach that would be expected from totalitarian regimes and George Osborne, editor of the London Evening Standard and a former finance minister, called it a “very stupid and ill-advised statement from a junior officer who doesn't appear to understand much about press freedom”. “The state threatening media freedom is a dangerous road to tread,” Health Minister Matt Hancock said on Twitter. Basu issued a further statement on Saturday, stating that the police respected media rights but reiterating the message that there should be no further publication of the leaked documents and others which he said remained in circulation. “The focus of the investigation is clearly on identifying who was responsible for the leak,” Basu said. “However, we have also been told the publication of these specific documents, now knowing they may be a breach of the OSA (Official Secrets Act), could also constitute a criminal offence and one that carries no public interest defence.”  Both men battling to replace Theresa May as prime minister when she steps down on July 24 because she failed to deliver Britain's exit from the European Union, had earlier said the warning from Basu was wrong. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and his predecessor Boris Johnson said the leaker should be found but the press should not be targeted. ""It cannot be conceivably right that newspapers or any other media organisation publishing such material should face prosecution,"" Mr Johnson, also a former mayor of London, told an event in central England. Mr Hunt wrote on Twitter: ""I defend to the hilt the right of the press to publish those leaks if they receive them & judge them to be in the public interest: that is their job."" The Mail on Sunday newspaper last week published cables from Kim Darroch, Britain's ambassador to the United States, in which he called the Trump administration ""inept"", prompting the president to label him ""very stupid"" and ""wacky"". The spat has become one of the central issues of the contest for the leadership of the governing Conservative Party and the next prime minister that will be decided by about 160,000 members of the Conservative Party. A diplomatic source told  that the lack of backing from the frontrunner, Mr Johnson, had been a factor in Mr Darroch's decision to resign. Mr Johnson himself acknowledged his comments had been partly responsible but denied he was to blame. Not all politicians, though, felt the police were wrong.

"US proposes barring big tech companies from offering financial services, digital currencies",Jul 15 2019,"WASHINGTON () - A proposal to prevent big technology companies from functioning as financial institutions or issuing digital currencies has been circulated for discussion by the Democratic majority that leads the United States House Committee on Financial Services, according to a copy of the draft legislation seen by . In a sign of widening scrutiny after Facebook's proposed Libra digital coin aroused widespread objection, the Bill proposes a fine of US$1 million (S$1.36 million) a day for violation of such rules. Such a sweeping proposal would likely spark opposition from Republican members of the House who are keen on innovation, and would likely struggle to gather enough votes to pass the lower chamber. Even if it were to pass the full House, it would still have to pass the Senate, which would also likely be an uphill struggle. Nevertheless, the draft proposal sends a strong message to large tech firms increasingly eyeing the financial services space. The draft legislation, ""Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance Act"", describes a large technology firm as a company mainly offering an online platform service with at least US$25 billion in annual revenue. ""A large platform utility may not establish, maintain or operate a digital asset that is intended to be widely used as medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value or any other similar function, as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,"" it proposes. Facebook, which would qualify to be such an entity, said last month it would launch its global cryptocurrency in 2020. Facebook and 28 partners, including Mastercard, PayPal and Uber Technologies, would form the Libra Association to govern the new coin. No banks are now part of the group. Last week, US President Donald Trump criticised Libra and other cryptocurrencies and demanded that companies seek a banking charter and make themselves subject to US and global regulations if they wanted to ""become a bank"". His comments came after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers that Facebook's plan to build a digital currency called Libra could not move forward unless it addressed concerns over privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability.

"Auto companies in India cut more jobs, halt production to tackle slowdown",Aug 22 2019," (The August 22 story corrects paragraph 7 to clarify Bellsonica makes auto framework parts and adds co response.) By Sudarshan Varadhan and Aditi Shah NEW DELHI () - With India's auto sales declining for the ninth straight month in July, more automotive manufacturers are laying off workers and temporarily halting production to keep costs in check, according to sources and documents seen by .  Japanese carmaker Toyota Motor () and South Korea's Hyundai Motor () are the latest in a string of companies to briefly halt some parts of production at plants to combat slumping sales, according to company memos to employees, reviewed by . Passenger vehicle sales in July fell at the fastest pace in nearly two decades. The sales declines have triggered major job cuts in India's auto sector, with many companies forced to shut down factories for days and axe shifts.  Sources have told  that even more companies have now begun to lay off temporary workers as the slowdown worsens.  Denso Corp's () India unit, which makes powertrain  and air-conditioning systems for cars, has cut some temporary workers at its Manesar plant in north India, four sources familiar with the matter told .  A spokeswoman for Denso said the information was incorrect and declined to elaborate further. In a separate email, another company official disputed that the firm employed temporary workers at its Manesar plant.  Bellsonica, which is part-owned by India's biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki () and makes auto framework parts, has also let more than 350 workers go in Manesar, two sources said. In an email, Bellsonica said the workers that had been let go were temporary workers, and most had been let go earlier in the year.  earlier this month reported automakers, component manufacturers and dealers had already cut 350,000 jobs.  In a meeting with India's finance ministry on Aug. 7, industry executives asked for tax cuts, and easier access to finance for dealers and buyers, in an effort to revive sales. Toyota, in a notice dated Aug. 13, told its workers the company would halt production at its plants in Bengaluru in southern India on Aug. 16 and 17 “due to low market demand of vehicles” and high stock of about 7,000 vehicles. N. Raja, deputy managing director, at Toyota's India unit, told  that while the company had a flexible production system it had to resort to five no-production days in August to prevent the build up of stock. “The industry is deeply concerned with the reality of poor customer sentiment faced by the sector,” said Raja, adding he hoped the government would step in to support the industry.  Hyundai, in a memo on Aug. 9, also said it would halt production for several days in August across various departments including the body shop and paint shop as well as its engine and transmission plants.  A Hyundai Motor India spokesman said the company expected sales to pick up in the festive season starting next month and added that the company had not laid off any workers.

India's court sends ex-finance minister Chidambaram into police custody,Aug 22 2019,"NEW DELHI () - An Indian court on Thursday (Aug 22) ordered a former finance minister into police custody for questioning for four days, in a case stemming from government approval of foreign investment in a local media company, a judge said. The rare action against P. Chidambaram, a top leader of the main opposition Congress party and a trenchant critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, drew opposition accusations that the authorities are pursuing a political vendetta. Chidambaram was arrested at his New Delhi home on Wednesday after federal police agents jumped over the wall when they found the gates closed. On Thursday, he appeared before a federal police court which said it needed to hold him until Aug 26 for further questioning. ""Considering all the facts of the case, the police custody is justified,"" judge Ajay Kumar Kuhar said. The allegations in the case centre around the role of Chidambaram, his son Karti Chidambaram, and several former government officials, in approving foreign direct investment in local media firm INX Media in 2007. The Central Bureau of Investigation says the approval was illegal and that it was a case of ""abuse of power"". Chidambaram who was finance minister at the time said the approvals were done by a government committee and he didn't have any role to play. His son who runs a consultancy also denied any wrong. Chidambaram, 73, looking slightly pale, appeared in court flanked by police agents and lawyers. The court said his family could see him for 30 minutes each day during his custody. The Congress party accused the Modi government of building a false case against the former finance minister.","{'neg': 0.091, 'neu': 0.854, 'pos': 0.055, 'compound': -0.8591}",-0.8591
"Microlending goes digital, bringing debt stress to the masses",Aug 22 2019,"NAIROBI () - With no bank account to his name, J.Barasa still found a lender to finance his passion for gambling on soccer. All it took was a few clicks on his phone and his willingness to pay annual interest of more than 150 per cent. The 32-year-old Nairobi taxi driver represents the new frontier in the market for mobile money, the universe where banking is done over the phone. Its proliferation is making it easier than ever to borrow, marrying convenience to need and creating a level of stress that only crushing debt can produce. In Kenya, Africa's financial-technology pioneer, there are now more people keeping money on their phones than in banks. Almost one-fifth of mobile-banking borrowers there defaulted last year - like Barasa, who has failed to pay three separate loans. He's hoping friends and family will help to repay 22,000 shillings (S$294). ""Mobile loans are easy to get and addictive,"" said Barasa, who asked that his given name not be published. ""I need a fresh start but can't see it."" Microlending was once nothing but a good news story. Muhammad Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 - a year before the introduction of the iPhone - for pioneering the concept in Bangladesh: loans of as little as US$10 to mostly women entrepreneurs too poor to tap banks. Along the way, Kenya established a goal of providing universal access to financial services, a promise made easier amid the smartphone revolution. Sub-Saharan Africa has proven the most fertile ground for microlending through mobile devices. In 2018, there were 395.7 million mobile-money accounts in the region, or almost half of the world total; the US$26.8 billion handled represents two-thirds of the total transactions, according to GSMA, which represents 750 mobile operators around the world. Asia is the closest competitor, with such transactions equivalent to about 7 per cent of its economy compared with about 10 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa, according to World Bank data. In the rest of the world, it's less than 2 per cent. In Kenya, with more than 50 mobile lenders offering loans ranging from US$10 to US$400, officials are trying to get their arms around a business that took off after a 2016 law capping interest rates to reduce borrowing costs. Banks instead invested more in government debt and tightened their standards, sending small unsecured borrowers to mobile lenders. Mobile-money operators ""shouldn't be lending out money in the order of magnitude that it's out of control,"" said Christophe Meunier, a senior partner at Delta Partners Group, an advisory firm for technology and media companies. ""They should have an incentive to control lending through the platform."" By far, the dominant force is M-Pesa, the payments platform of Vodafone Plc's Safaricom unit. Begun more than a decade ago, M-Pesa became a revolutionary service now used by more than 22 million for transferring money and buying everything from groceries to shopping on the Alibaba e-commerce site. An overdraft facility, called Fuliza, recorded transactions of 29 billion shillings in three months after its introduction in November. M for mobile and Pesa for money in Swahili, M-Pesa provides a digital wallet on Safaricom phones. The services ""have opened up access for millions of Kenyans over the last five years,"" a Safaricom spokesman said, adding almost half of bank accounts are mobile based. The option to deposit and borrow can be activated within the M-Pesa wallet, sending you to M-Shwari, a mobile-banking venture between Commercial Bank of Africa and Safaricom. KCB Group Plc, Kenya's biggest lender, also joined Safaricom to start a second lending service in the M-Pesa wallet. Spokesmen at CBA and KCB didn't immediately respond to an email request for comment. M-Shwari charges 7.5 per cent of the amount borrowed per month. That compares with annual commercial bank lending rates of about 13.2 per cent. Defaulters have their savings frozen and are reported to the credit reference bureau. There are also finance companies like Alphabet Inc-backed Tala, which raises money from investors. Tala, whose biggest market is Kenya, has disbursed US$750 million in loans of between US$10 and US$300 in the last five years, says its East Africa growth manager, Ivan Mbowa. Its customers borrow from 21 to 30 days and are charged as much as 15 per cent - a rate that reflects non-traditional credit checks, such as information mined on social media and dining and shopping patterns. The expansion in consumer debt has an inevitable dark side. While yotal lending by banks grew 5 per cent to 2.5 trillion shillings in the year ending June 2018, non-performing loans climbed 27 per cent to 298 billion shillings, according to the central bank. Two-thirds of Kenyan borrowers are in debt stress - those caught in a debt spiral or those who have to sell an asset or reduce food spending to repay loans - according to FSD Kenya, a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation-backed financial-inclusion advocate. ""My worry in Kenya is that the borrowing middle classes may also find themselves in a cycle of escalating debt,"" says Amrik Heyer, head of research at FSD. For the vulnerable, including young or poor people, ""who may borrow to survive, digital credit is in danger of destroying the very market that feeds it."" It's not as bad as it looks, says Tala's Mbowa. ""Our charges should be looked at as total cost of borrowing, and not annualized,"" he said in an interview from his office on a sixth-floor in Nairobi. Some Tala loans are repaid within days. Authorities are most concerned about unregulated finance companies, giving them more leeway both in pricing and collection practices. Some lenders aggressively dun debtors, calling their friends and relatives to compel them to pay.","{'neg': 0.069, 'neu': 0.853, 'pos': 0.078, 'compound': 0.8902}",0.8902
Indians pawning the family gold amid credit crunch,Aug 22 2019,"AURANGABAD () - Refused a loan by a state-run lender and desperate for funds to buy cotton seeds before the summer sowing season window closed, Indian farmer Babasaheb Mandlik ran out of choices - he pawned his wife's gold jewellery. Mr Mandlik, who owns an 3.2 ha cotton farm in western India, pledged 70 grams of gold, almost all of his wife's precious trinkets, in June in return for 150,000 rupees (S$2,910). ""Pawning the jewellery was a difficult decision as my wife likes to wear it at festivals and weddings,"" 50-year-old Mandlik told . ""I convinced her that we didn't have any other option."" Mr Mandlik is not alone. While pawning gold has long been an option for quick funds in a country that is the world's second-biggest consumer of the yellow metal, several lenders told  of unprecedented demand as people struggle to secure loans from banks grappling with bad debt and a shadow lending industry stung by a liquidity crunch. The trend, which has prompted some lenders to impose restrictions as risks and borrowing costs rise, has been accelerated by record gold prices. Indians' penchant for gold spans centuries and is rooted in the Hindu religion. Households own an estimated collective 25,000 tonnes of gold, which passes from one generation to the next. Domestic gold prices have risen more than a fifth this calendar year, hitting a record high of 38,666 rupees per 10 grams earlier this month amid a global rise. ""As a lot of NBFCs (non-bank financial companies) have become cautious of giving unsecured or even secured loans, we are seeing more customers opting for gold loans instead,"" said Sumit Bali, chief executive officer of IIFL Finance. ""One can obtain a gold loan and walk out of the branch in just thirty minutes."" IIFL's gold loan portfolio stood at 65.83 billion rupees (S$1.28 billion) at the end of the June quarter, up 46 per cent compared to a year earlier. Those pawning their precious possessions are most often independent workers, including farmers and small shop owners. Muthoot Fincorp, a leading gold financing shadow bank with 2.98 million customers, said its gold loans rose 6.6 per cent between April 1 and July 24 this year to 358 billion rupees. ""Pledging gold is becoming more lucrative with rising prices. We have seen healthy demand for gold loans in the last few months,"" said George Muthoot, director at Muthoot Fincorp. Ashutosh Khajuria, the chief financial officer of Federal Bank, a private lender headquartered in south India, said its gold loan portfolio was at an all-time high of around 80 billion rupees and is expected to grow further. Indian shadow banks began to face a liquidity crunch following the collapse late last year of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services, a major player in the non-banking financial companies space. That led to a surge in borrowing costs, forcing NBFCs to freeze, or tighten lending practices. Some gold lenders who are also NBFCs have not been immune, despite their increased popularity with borrowers and the solid commodity backing their loans. Manappuram Finance, which has 2.5 million gold loan accounts, last week revealed its cost of funds in the April-June quarter rose to 9.34 per cent from 8.77 per cent a year earlier. Muthoot has independently decided to trim the maximum loan amount of 75 per cent of gold value imposed by India's central bank to 70 per cent, citing higher borrowing costs and the need to shield itself from any future volatility in gold prices.

SRC trial: Najib splurged RM3.3 million on jewellery for Qatar sheik's wife,Aug 23 2019,"KUALA LUMPUR - The corruption trial against former premier Najib Razak, who allegedly misappropriated RM42 million from a unit of state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), is on the tail end of the prosecution's case, with the defence expected to wrap up its cross-examination of the last prosecution witness early next week.Nadirah H. Rodzi The trial will then move on to the much-anticipated hearing of Najib's alleged connection with the misappropriation funds from 1MDB. On Friday (Aug 23), the court heard from the 57th prosecution witness, Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission investigating officer Rosli Hussain, that RM3.3 million was charged to Najib's credit card at a Swiss jewellery outlet in Italy on Aug 14, 2014. But Mr Rosli said it was a ""mere claim"" when asked by the defence if the gift was for the wife of former Qatar premier Hamad Jassim Jaber al-Thani, a country with which Malaysia had close relations. Defence counsel Farhan Read then produced a letter dated Aug 15, 2014, purportedly addressed to Najib's wife Rosmah Mansor, from Noor Abdulaziz Abdulla Turki Al-Subaie, the sheik's wife, to express her appreciation for the gift. In response, Mr Rosli said: ""Rosmah had never mentioned to me this letter."" Yesterday's hearing was the 57th day of the trial concerning SRC International which is expected to be concluded next Tuesday before 1MDB's proceedings begin the following day. SRC, a former unit of 1MDB, had received RM4 billion (S$1.33 billion) in loans from the civil servant pension fund, KWAP, the court heard. Keep up with the latest in the region with the ST Asian Insider newsletter, delivered to your inbox every weekday By signing up, you agree to our   and  The loans were guaranteed by the finance ministry, when Najib was the minister. Of this sum, RM42 million was then channelled into Najib's personal accounts. The prosecution had detailed this month how the money was used for private spending, including the purchase of designer items, luxury jewellery, and hotel stays. Najib's counsel this week attempted to pin the blame on fugitive financier Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low. Mr Rosli, however, dismissed all suggestions which implied that it was Mr Low who had misappropriated the funds deposited in Najib's personal AmBank accounts, by asserting that the businessman had not benefited from the SRC funds, according to his investigation. Earlier Friday, the court also heard from Mr Rosli that his officers had taken Mr Low's statement in Abu Dhabi on Nov 27, 2015, as well as SRC International Sdn Bhd former CEO Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil's statement in Jakarta on Oct 17 the same year. The trial has not been without drama. On July 25, it was put on a temporary halt following a bomb threat. But the biggest highlight throughout the case has been the amount of power the former premier had when he was the prime minister of Malaysia, coupled with the direct involvement of Mr Low with Najib's personal finances, which painted Najib as the puppet-master. A key witness, former SRC director Datuk Suboh Md Yassin, had also told the court under cross-examination that Mr Faisal was capable of forging signatures to expedite the movement of millions of ringgit as he had the backing of someone powerful. Mr Suboh also claimed that in 2015, he was forced to hide in Bangkok and Abu Dhabi after he was directed to go abroad by an unknown individual who claimed to be a representative from the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission and not meet its officers. ""I was fearful of what was happening and because Datuk Seri Najib Razak was in power as the prime minister at that time,"" he said. However, Mr Suboh's credibility is now being quizzed following a series of inconsistencies in his statements. In 2015, he had told a recording officer that all signatures instructing AmBank to conduct real-time electronic transfers and securities automatic transactions were his but in May last year, he changed his statement when two recording officers visited him at a hotel, saying that the signatures had been falsified. In two subsequent meetings with MACC officers at the anti-graft agency's headquarters in August, he changed his statement again, saying the signatures were his before admitting that his signature might have been forged to authorise transactions involving millions of ringgit in connection to SRC International during a cross-examination. He then told the court that the signatures on the documents were his.","{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.926, 'pos': 0.035, 'compound': -0.7311}",-0.7311
City Harvest founder Kong Hee out of prison,Aug 23 2019,"City Harvest Church founder Kong Hee was released from jail yesterday after serving more than two years for his role in misusing millions of dollars in church funds.Theresa Tan He remains a spiritual leader in the church, although he has not been on the payroll since 2005. In a statement on the church's website, its board and senior management said that Mr Kong will be ""taking a period to spend time with his family, especially his elderly parents"". While in jail, he spent most of his time seeking and studying ""the things of God"", the statement said. Mr Kong also thanked church members for all their prayers for him and his family. ""Your letters brought him comfort and joy,"" said the statement, which also urged members to continue to keep Mr Kong, his wife Ho Yeow Sun, son Dayan and parents in prayer. With his jail sentence reduced from eight years to 31/2 years upon appeal, Mr Kong's release came a day before he turned 55. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  He served two years and four months. Inmates are usually given one-third remission on their sentence for good behaviour. His sentence was the longest among the six church leaders who were involved in misappropriating $50 million in church funds, in the largest case of misuse of charitable funds in Singapore's history. In 2017, the Commissioner of Charities permanently barred Mr Kong and the five other leaders from holding key management positions or being a board member in City Harvest Church or any other charity. This is to protect the church's assets, given that they were convicted of offences involving dishonesty and/or deception. The commissioner, Dr Ang Hak Seng, also prohibited the church from hiring or appointing the six without his approval. He told The Straits Times that he has not received any such request from City Harvest regarding Mr Kong. A City Harvest spokesman told ST that Mr Kong Hee is not a church employee, and has not been on the payroll since 2005. The spokesman added: ""His role in the City Harvest Church as senior pastor is a spiritual one; he has no executive role."" Contacted at his Upper Bukit Timah home yesterday, Mr Kong declined comment. Neighbours said his family moved into the terraced house about a year ago. Besides Mr Kong, the rest of the church's leaders also had their terms shortened. Four of the other five convicted in the case have also been released from jail. The four are: Former deputy senior pastor Tan Ye Peng, former finance managers Serina Wee and Sharon Tan, and former finance committee member John Lam. The fifth, former fund manager Chew Eng Han, had his sentence of three years and four months extended by 13 months after he tried to flee the country. He will be the last to complete his sentence. The six were originally charged and convicted of criminal breach of trust as agents under Section 409 of the Penal Code in 2015 after a 142-day trial, and given jail terms ranging from 21 months to eight years. These were all reduced after an appeal, in which the court accepted that an agent is someone who is a professional agent and not company directors or key officers of charities, such as the City Harvest leaders. Last month, The Sunday Times reported that City Harvest Church collected $29 million in donations last year, marking a near 40 per cent drop from the $47 million it raised from November 2016 to December 2017. It had about 16,000 church members last year and was among the top 10 richest charities by donations here. The six were City Harvest Church (CHC) founder and senior pastor Kong Hee, 54; deputy senior pastor Tan Ye Peng, 46; former finance managers Serina Wee, 42; and Sharon Tan, 43; former fund manager Chew Eng Han, 58; and former finance committee member John Lam, 51.  Mr Kong was sentenced to a jail term of 31/2 years, the longest sentence of the six. Chew got three years and four months; Mr Tan, three years and two months; Ms Wee, 21/2 years; Mr Lam, 11/2 years; and Ms Tan, seven months. Mr Kong was released from jail yesterday. Mr Tan, Ms Tan, Ms Wee and Mr Lam have also been released from prison. Chew, whose jail term was extended by 13 months after he tried unsuccessfully to flee the country, will be the last to complete his sentence.  They misappropriated $24 million in CHC's building funds through sham bond investments in music production firm Xtron and glass maker Firna. They then misused a further $26 million to cover up the initial crime. These bonds were used to fund the Crossover Project, a church mission to spread the Gospel through the secular music career of Mr Kong's wife, pop singer Ho Yeow Sun.  The six were originally charged and convicted of criminal breach of trust (CBT) as agents under Section 409 of the Penal Code. They were handed jail terms ranging from 21 months to eight years in November 2015.  The six appealed against their convictions and sentences, while the prosecution appealed for harsher sentences ranging from five to 12 years. Deciding on the appeals in April 2017, the High Court, in a split 2-1 decision, cleared the six of CBT as agents and found them guilty of plain CBT under Section 406 of the Penal Code. As a result, their jail terms were cut to between seven months and 31/2 years.  The prosecution then applied for a rarely invoked criminal reference to seek a definitive ruling from the Court of Appeal as well as to reinstate the original convictions. In coming to a decision, the Court of Appeal overruled a 1976 High Court decision which had held that company directors could be convicted of CBT under Section 409. This means that the apex court has ruled that company directors, as well as governing board members or key officers of charities and officers of societies, who commit CBT are only liable to be punished under Section 406. The offence carries a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment. In contrast, those who commit CBT under Section 409 may face up to 15 years in jail. In response to the Court of Appeal's decision, the Attorney-General's Chambers said that it would work with relevant government ministries ""on the appropriate revisions to the Penal Code to ensure that company directors and other persons in similar positions of trust and responsibility are subject to appropriate punishments if they commit criminal breach of trust"".  For the criminal cases, yes. The decision of the apex court on Feb 1 last year was final and brings the long-running saga to a close. Criminal investigations into the case began in 2010. The trial stretched over 142 days, from its start in 2013 to sentencing in November 2015. It is one of the longest criminal cases in history, shorter only than a drug trafficking case in the 1990s that went on for 168 days.","{'neg': 0.059, 'neu': 0.872, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': 0.2134}",0.2134

Unis already using endowments to help needy students: Ong Ye Kung,Aug 23 2019,"The multibillion-dollar endowment funds of local universities came under the spotlight yesterday when Education Minister Ong Ye Kung was asked why these should not be used to fund more bursaries for needy students. Mr Ong said the universities were already doing this.Sandra Davie Pointing out that endowments play an important role in supplementing the Government's financial aid to needy students, he said that many of these bursaries come from the donations received by universities. This is evident in the bursaries that carry the names of the donors. Media report have recently touched on the sizeable amounts in university endowment funds, and some have asked whether universities should still be com-peting with charities for the ""donations pie"". The Straits Times recently reported that Singapore's most successful fund-raiser, the National University of Singapore (NUS), collected $227 million in donations in its financial year that ended in March last year. It had reserves of $9.5 billion and an investment income of $620 million for the year. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) had $3.7 billion in reserves and an investment income of $149 million for the same year. It raised $50 million in donations. Mr Ong said universities such as NUS and NTU also use the income generated from their en-dowment funds in many other ways, including setting up joint labs with industry partners, incubators to support student entrepreneurs, partnerships with other universities, funding research and student exchanges. He also noted that some universities have much larger endowment funds than the $9.5 billion that NUS holds. Harvard University's endowment, the world's largest, grew 10 per cent to US$39.2 billion (S$54.3 billion) in the financial year which ended in June last year. It was followed by Yale University, whose endowment grew 12.3 per cent to US$29.4 billion. An NUS spokesman had said it uses the investment income from its endowment and reserves to finance a variety of operational costs, including scholarships, support for research and to promote entrepreneurship. Meanwhile, a spokesman for NTU said it was essential to raise funds to reduce its reliance on public funding. He added that ""multiple sources of funding are necessary to deliver quality education and research, and build a culture of innovation and community engagement that translates into jobs and real benefits for society"".","{'neg': 0.014, 'neu': 0.916, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': 0.9655}",0.9655
"Noble to rebuild LNG, core energy businesses",Aug 23 2019,"Noble Group Holdings plans to rebuild its liquefied natural gas (LNG) and core energy businesses and develop rare earths as it seeks new life as a niche, Asia-focused commodity trader, sources aware of the matter said. ""We have enough credit lines to expand the LNG business. In our restructuring, we made sure we had ample credit facilities so we could build the business that we lost,"" said one senior executive with the company, which took over assets of the under-liquidation Noble Group. Noble Holdings has now set up a Singapore desk for LNG by hiring a former trader from Australia's Origin Energy, expanding its four-person LNG team in London, industry sources told .

The fresh funds will help accelerate the onboarding of vegetable hawkers and retailers as its partners (also known as Mitra Sayur), further extend its network of suppliers and develop its technology, the company said in a press statement on Friday (Aug 23). Kedai Sayur, which translates to ""vegetable kiosk"", was established with the mission to bring the benefits of the digital economy to Indonesia's vegetable hawkers. According to the company, most hawkers in Indonesia struggle to source for competitive fresh produce due to the long supply chain that raises costs by two to three times and affects the freshness of food. Essentially, the start-up cuts out middleman vendors and works with farmers and hawker partners directly for sourcing and distribution of vegetables. The process helps increase the profit margins and quality of products for hawkers, who are typically in the ""last mile"" of the supply chain. Hawker partners can access Kedai Sayur's products through its app and pick them up from the nearest drop-off points. Grocers who join the start-up's platform can register as these drop-off points.

"David Koch, billionaire donor to Republican causes, dies age 79",Aug 23 2019,"WASHINGTON (AFP) - David Koch, a billionaire American libertarian and influential donor to conservative causes, has died at age 79 after a long battle with cancer, his brother Charles said on Friday (Aug 23). Koch retired last year as executive vice-president of Koch Industries, the conglomerate he co-owned with his older brother and built into the second largest family-owned company in the United States. ""We wish for all to celebrate the life and impact of this most generous and kind man,"" Charles Koch said in a statement. ""He believed he had a responsibility to a world that had given him so many opportunities to succeed."" Both brothers were a force behind the scenes in Republican politics, donating heavily to candidates and causes that reflected their conservative economic positions. But David was socially liberal - a supporter of abortion rights and same-sex marriage as well as a non-interventionist foreign policy. Both brothers were recognised in 2015 for bipartisan work on prison reform in the United States. Among those offering condolences was Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who, like the Koch brothers, is from Kansas. David Koch ran as the Libertarian Party's vice-presidential candidate in 1980, but later broke with it and swung to the Republicans. He joined his brother Charles in financing a network of conservative organisations, in particular Americans for Prosperity, centred on demands for low taxes and deregulation with the aim of influencing US elections. Those organisations helped fuel the rise of the Tea Party movement in 2010, mounting a frontal Republican challenge to former Democratic president Barack Obama. The Kochs' power was such that in the next presidential elections, Republican candidates vied for their endorsement, attending exclusive conferences the brothers organised. Donald Trump, whose conservative credentials the brothers viewed with suspicion and who in turn often mocked them, was the exception. Of the two, Charles has been most involved in the political networks while David had been more active in philanthropic endeavors, mainly in New York.

Ex-Vatican treasurer George Pell loses appeal against child sex offence convictions,Aug 21 2019,"MELBOURNE (AP, ) - An Australian court by a 2-1 majority ruling on Wednesday (Aug 21) upheld  , the most senior Catholic to be found guilty of child sex abuse. The Victoria state Court of Appeal rejected Pell's appeal of the unanimous verdicts a jury issued in December finding Pope Francis' former finance minister   in Melbourne's St Patrick's Cathedral in 1996 and 1997. At the time, Pell had just become archbishop of Australia's second-largest city and had set up a world-first compensation arrangement for victims of clergy sexual abuse. His lawyers are expected to appeal against the decision in the High Court, Australia's final arbiter. Pell, 78, showed no emotion when Chief Justice Anne Ferguson read the verdict to a packed courtroom, but bowed his head moments later. He wore a cleric's collar but not his cardinal's ring. Pell had arrived at the court in a prison van and was handcuffed as he was led away by a guard. The Vatican acknowledged the court's decision to uphold Pell's conviction on sexual abuse but said he has a right to another appeal. ""As the proceedings continue to develop, the Holy See recalls that the Cardinal has always maintained his innocence throughout the judicial process and that it is his right to appeal to the High Court,"" the Vatican said in a statement. ""At this time, together with the Church in Australia, the Holy See confirms its closeness to the victims of sexual abuse and its commitment to pursue, through the competent ecclesiastical authorities, those members of the clergy who commit such abuse."" Pell is no longer a member of Pope Francis' council of cardinals or a Vatican official. Clerical sexual abuse and the Catholic church's handling of such cases worldwide have thrown Francis' papacy into turmoil. In a little more than a year, the pope has acknowledged he made ""grave errors"" in Chile's worst cover-up, Pell was convicted of abuse, a French cardinal was convicted of failing to report a paedophile, and a third cardinal, former US church leader Theodore McCarrick, was defrocked after a Vatican investigation determined he molested children and adults. Pell's lawyers had to prove to the appeals court that the jury that unanimously convicted him in December must have held a reasonable doubt about his guilt. An earlier trial had ended in a deadlocked jury. An 11-to-1 majority decision to either convict or acquit could have been accepted, but at least two jurors held out. Prosecutors replied that the evidence of more than 20 priests, choristers, altar servers and church officials showed there were ""possible hindrances"" to the prosecution case, but did not preclude the jury from being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of Pell's guilt. Pell's lawyers argue the events in 1996 as described in the prosecution case were ""improbable and even impossible"" to have happened quickly and in part of the cathedral where altar servers and priests were likely to walk in at any moment. One of the choirboys, identified by the sentencing judge as J.J., was the key prosecution witness. His friend, identified as M.R., died of a heroin overdose in 2014 at the age of 31 without ever complaining he had been abused. The father of the dead choirboy, neither of whom can be named, attended the court hearing on Wednesday, the father's lawyer Lisa Flynn said before the hearing. Ms Flynn said a Pell win would be ""devastating"" for the father, but that he would continue with a civil suit against Pell and the Church regardless of the outcome. ""Survivors and victims of child sex abuse all over the world will be watching with bated breath this morning as this decision is handed down,"" Ms Flynn told Nine Network television outside court. ""I do think it's one of the most important legal outcomes for survivors of abuse in recent history and I think that the outcome will have an impact right around the world,"" she added. Pell did not testify at either of his trials. But both juries saw a video of a police interview of him in Rome in 2016, in which he rejected the allegations as ""absolutely disgraceful rubbish"" and a ""deranged falsehood"". When  , the trial judge accused Pell of showing ""staggering arrogance"" in his crimes.","{'neg': 0.177, 'neu': 0.769, 'pos': 0.054, 'compound': -0.9987}",-0.9987

Indian investigators arrest key opposition leader Chidambaram,Aug 22 2019,"NEW DELHI (AP) - Federal investigators on Wednesday (Aug 21) arrested a key opposition Indian National Congress party leader at his home in the Indian capital in a suspected money laundering case. Palaniappan Chidambaram was taken into custody on suspicion of conspiring with a Mauritius-based firm to illegally obtain money for his son's company while he was India's finance minister in 2006. Abhishek Dayal, a spokesman for the Central Bureau of Investigation, confirmed the arrest. Investigators took Chidambaram from his New Delhi home on Wednesday night and drove him to the Central Bureau of Investigation's office. His son Karti Chidambaram has already been named as a defendant in the money-laundering case involving 3 billion rupees (S$58 million).  Chidambaram denies the allegation and accuses Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government of pursuing a political vendetta.  He suffered a setback as a court on Tuesday rejected his bail plea in the case. Investigators couldn't find Palaniappan Chidambaram until Wednesday evening as his attorneys tried to get bail for him from the country's top court. The Supreme Court scheduled his bail plea for a hearing on Friday. Chidambaram unexpectedly appeared at his party headquarters on Wednesday night and addressed reporters. He asked the prosecutors to wait until Friday for a ruling by the top court. He said he was yet to be formally charged in the case. The CBI, he claimed, hasn't imputed any wrongdoing in the criminal case registered against him. ""Yet there is a widespread impression that grave offences have been committed"" by him and his son), he told reporters. Teams of investigators soon rushed to the Congress party headquarters and his New Delhi home to arrest him. Corruption in business deals is rampant in India. Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party came to power after defeating a Congress party government in 2014 and won a second term in 2019 national elections. Several top-level Congress politicians and high ranking bureaucrats faced bribery charges after hosting the New Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games. For years, anti-corruption campaigners have said the party in power uses the top investigating agency to cover up wrongdoing and target political opponents.","{'neg': 0.102, 'neu': 0.811, 'pos': 0.086, 'compound': -0.7269}",-0.7269
"Survey: Firms expecting falling revenues, rising business costs",Aug 22 2019,"More Singapore businesses are expecting a drop in their revenue and profit margin as the economy slows, with trade tensions being a top concern among them.Grace Ho These were findings from a survey of more than 970 respondents released yesterday by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI).Seow Bei Yi As companies gear up for rising business costs amid policy changes and slowing growth, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said in a Facebook post that ministers from the Finance Ministry will continue to engage businesses, unions and other stakeholders. Upcoming changes include a raise in the retirement and re-employment ages, and the Government will develop a support package to help companies with the transition, he said. While companies are expecting business costs to go up with these changes, the SCCCI's annual business survey this year also found that close to 40 per cent of those polled between May and July foresee a fall in revenue, up from around 27 per cent last year. About 70 per cent of the firms said they are facing the challenge of rising business costs as well, while around 55 per cent forecast a dip in profits this year, the group's president Roland Ng said at its annual SME Conference yesterday.

New approach to deliver help to firms on the way,Aug 22 2019,"Firms may no longer need to approach government agencies separately for specific grants but instead can deal with a single point of contact for support on business plans, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said yesterday.Seow Bei Yi ""We are going to make our help schemes company-centric, not scheme-centric,"" Mr Chan said at a Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) conference. Rather than telling agencies which schemes they want to adopt, companies could go to them with a business plan instead and leave it to officials to find out what will help the most, he said. The authorities have been working with the trade associations and chambers to deliver this better. It is also among the latest commitments made to support businesses ahead of upcoming policy changes and slowing economic growth. The second-quarter growth came in at just 0.1 per cent from a year ago, fuelling fears of a possible technical recession as global trade tensions squeeze open economies such as Singapore's. Firms are also gearing up for increasing costs on account of local policy changes, with a rise in retirement and re-employment ages on the horizon, on top of an upcoming hike in older workers' Central Provident Fund contribution rates.

GET READY FOR NEXT GROWTH WAVE MR CHAN CHUN SING, Minister for Trade and Industry. This comes as more businesses are expecting a drop in their revenue and profit margin, amid slowing economic growth and an ongoing trade war.

Of those surveyed, 95 per cent were SMEs. Amid these growing worries, Association of Small and Medium Enterprises president Kurt Wee told The Straits Times that the move to make help schemes more company-centric is a further step after a consolidation of grants since last year to make them less complex for smaller companies. But he added: ""The devil will be in the details, and that will involve whether we have experienced officers who understand the schemes across agencies, as well as businesses' needs."" Mr Chan added that firms need to be aware that the trade war is unlikely to be a short-term issue. The worst-case scenario is a fragmentation of the global trading order, he pointed out.

He noted the need for companies to continue diversifying their markets and reaping the full benefits of Singapore's free trade agreements. They should also look to growing revenue and going international. Firms ought to also be ready for the next wave of growth, said Mr Chan. ""Let us not just look at short-term challenges,"" he said.

"Bonds, reserves could be used to fund climate battle",Aug 22 2019,"The issuance of government bonds to fund the $100 billion it could take to fight rising sea levels over the next century is one option that Singapore is mulling over, according to a Bloomberg report. Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli said in an interview yesterday that in the short term, funding for projects such as a $400 million upgrade to the city-state's drain-age systems to boost flood resilience will come from ministry-level expenditures. Longer-term spending, he said, could require the Government to tap its national reserves and issue state bonds. ""For those that have to be spent that will benefit future generations, we are talking about borrowing so that whatever we spend for the future will also be paid for by the future generations,"" Mr Masagos told Bloomberg TV. ""$100 billion is actually a lot of money even if spent over 100 years,"" he added. He announced last month that Singapore is fortifying its defences against climate change, with $400 million being pumped into upgrading and maintaining its drains over the next two years and $10 million more channelled to studying sea-level rise. It has spent around $1.8 billion in drainage improvement works since 2011. Climate change was also a key topic of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally speech, where he spoke of the need to build coastal defences. There are good engineering solutions, he said, estimating that it will cost ""probably $100 billion over 100 years, quite possibly more"" to protect against rising sea levels. ""Because this is a 50-to 100-year problem, we can implement a 50-to 100-year solution to this problem,"" PM Lee had said. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat had, in his Budget speech in February, noted that it is challenging to predict the exact timing and needs of items like infrastructure to protect against climate change.

The one job in banking the robots can't take,Aug 22 2019,"LONDON • When HSBC Holdings thwarted a US$500 million (S$691 million) central bank heist, sophisticated computer software didn't raise the alarm. The funds flowed undetected from Angola's reserves to a dormant company's account in London. It was a teller at a suburban bank branch who became suspicious, declined a request to transfer US$2 million, and triggered a review that uncovered the scam, according to one account of the episode. That was two years ago, and the finance industry's battle to stop the illicit transfer of as much as US$2 trillion a year around the globe hasn't become any easier. At least a half-dozen lenders in Europe have found themselves at the centre of fresh allegations of dirty money schemes in the past year. The wave of scandals - at Denmark's Danske Bank, Deutsche Bank, and others - is undermining confidence in the industry well beyond the individual institutions involved. Financial services executives have had little choice but to significantly step up regulatory efforts; more than one in 10 now spend in excess of 10 per cent of their annual budgets on compliance, according to financial adviser Duff & Phelps. Banks are eager to find ways to bring that spending down - management, employees and shareholders never want to spend on what are effectively internal cops. Today, there's a sense that growth may be peaking. About two-thirds of institutions considered systemically important on a global level, a leading indicator for the industry, expect the size of their compliance teams to remain unchanged or shrink, according to a Thomson  Regulatory Intelligence report. The largest companies want to adapt their teams to grow or scale back as necessary, the report said. That has led to buzz that banks are deploying artificial intelligence (AI) to replace surveillance staff. HSBC last year started using AI to screen transactions, and the two biggest Nordic banks have said they are replacing compliance staff with algorithms. Online banking start-ups, such as Revolut, which rely on computerised efficiency to compete with established lenders, are finding compliance a challenge they need to address. So far, machines are confined to simple know-your-customer (KYC) applications and are far from ready to replace humans, says Professor Tom Kirchmaier, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics' Centre for Economic Performance. He is not optimistic that a major advance is afoot, either. ""There's a lot of talk but no action,"" he says. Ask ING Group, which last year paid € 775 million (S$1.2 billion) to settle an investigation by a Dutch prosecutor into alleged money laundering and other corrupt practices. Even though the bank uses machine learning to filter out false alerts on potential bad actors, the lender has had to ramp up the number of individuals handling KYC procedures. It has tripled compliance personnel in the Netherlands over eight years; staff dedicated to KYC account for 5 per cent of total employees. Banks and tech companies need to overcome a number of obstacles for AI to succeed in tackling money laundering. For starters, they need better customer data, which is often neither current nor consistent, especially when a bank spans multiple jurisdictions. Enhancing the quality and frequency of data gathering is a crucial first step. Banks are also constrained in their ability to detect bad behaviour, with or without computers, because competitors and national law enforcement agencies won't share data. Across Europe, for example, regulation and enforcement are split along national borders. Lenders would benefit from a common European anti-money-laundering regulator, data sharing among banks, and a more open dialogue with bank supervisors, Citigroup analysts wrote in a note to clients in June. When banks do share information, it's often unhelpful. They tend to over-report suspicious activity to the relevant agencies to shed responsibility, but the enforcement authorities typically don't provide their findings to the financial companies. What's more, banks, wanting to shield bigger clients from unnecessary scrutiny, often under-report activity they should be flagging, according to Prof Kirchmaier. That leads to potentially suspicious transactions being classified as normal. The algorithms learn to replicate those types of decisions. In short, the historical data set available to train the machines is misleading, complicating their ability to learn detection. Criminals, by contrast, are constantly adapting their ways, finding new routes for their cash when existing ones are blocked off. Catching tomorrow's money launderers requires anticipating where they will move next. Will they trade gold or crypto assets? When parameters change even slightly, AI struggles to stay ahead of the criminals. Trust in financial services after the 2008 crisis is taking a very long time to rebuild. Banks are wary that they risk teaching machines to stereotype customers based on where they come from or where they do business. ""Ethical concerns associated with AI are rightfully restraining banks' full embrace of machine learning,"" says chief product officer Alexon Bell at Quantexa, a London-based data analytics company that counts HSBC among its customers. Regulators, frustrated with the slow speed of change, have encouraged banks to deploy more technology. One thing seems clear: Compliance spending at banks may be moving away from employing humans to adopting new software. But for now, those living and breathing internal cops are here to stay.","{'neg': 0.089, 'neu': 0.82, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.6753}",0.6753

The guide is part of an Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) programme for small- and medium-sized enterprises to help various sectors embark on their digital transformation journey. Similar industry digital plans have been launched for the logistics, media and food sectors, among others. The Accountancy Industry Digital Plan will include a list of solutions to guide small- and medium-sized practices in their adoption of technology at various stages of their growth. This can start at the basic level of digitalising hardcopy documents, for example, and move to more advanced levels where artificial intelligence-empowered chatbots are tapped to handle routine customer queries such as account balances and status of payments. Professionals in the sector can check against a list of training courses to acquire new digital skills relevant to their jobs, such as tax data analytics and an introduction to cyber security risks. Along with the plan, an SMP Centre and an Accounting Technology And Innovation Centre (AccTech Centre) were also launched. The SMP Centre ( ) is a dedicated online portal to help accountancy practices be more digitally competitive. There, small- and medium-sized practices can access a self-assessment tool kit to determine their digital readiness, as well as source for available funding schemes in their digital transformation journey. Those looking for more advanced and innovative processes can visit the AccTech Centre, located at the Singapore Institute of Technology, where participants can work with academics, technology partners and government agencies to prototype new projects.

City Harvest Church founder Kong Hee released from jail: Key facts about the multimillion-dollar case,Aug 22 2019,"SINGAPORE - A five-judge Court of Appeal on Feb 1, 2018, dismissed a bid by prosecutors to reinstate the original convictions for City Harvest Church (CHC) founder Kong Hee and five others convicted of misusing millions of dollars in church funds - ending a marathon case involving the misuse of millions of dollars of CHC funds.Ng Huiwen Here is what you need to know about the case:Prisca Ang The six are CHC founder and senior pastor Kong Hee, 54; deputy senior pastor Tan Ye Peng, 46; former finance managers Serina Wee, 42, and Sharon Tan, 43; former fund manager Chew Eng Han, 58, and former finance committee member John Lam, 51. Mr Kong was sentenced to a jail term of 3½ years, the longest sentence of the six. Chew got three years and four months; Mr Tan, three years and two months; Ms Tan, seven months; Ms Wee, 2½ years; and Mr Lam, 1½ years. Mr Kong was released from jail on Thursday (Aug 22). Mr Tan, Ms Tan, Ms Wee and Mr Lam have also been released from prison. Chew, whose jail term was extended by 13 months after he tried unsuccessfully to flee the country, will be the last to complete his sentence.

They then misused a further $26 million to cover up the initial crime. These bonds were used to fund the Crossover Project, a church mission to spread the Gospel through the secular music career of Mr Kong's wife, pop singer Ho Yeow Sun. The six were originally charged and convicted of criminal breach of trust (CBT) as agents, under Section 409 of the Penal Code. They were handed jail terms ranging from 21 months to eight years in November 2015. The six appealed against their convictions and sentences, while the prosecution appealed for harsher sentences. The prosecution had appealed for sentences ranging from five to 12 years for the six. Deciding on the appeals in April 2017, the High Court, in a split 2-1 decision, cleared the six of CBT as agents and found them guilty of plain CBT under Section 406 of the Penal Code. As a result, their jail terms were cut to between seven months and 3½ years. The prosecution then applied for a rarely invoked criminal reference, to seek a definitive ruling from the Court of Appeal as well as to reinstate the original convictions. The prosecution was led by Deputy Attorney-General Hri Kumar Nair in the hearing in August 2017. The panel includes Judges of Appeal Andrew Phang and Judith Prakash, and Justices Belinda Ang, Quentin Loh and Chua Lee Ming. In coming to this decision, the Court of Appeal overruled a 1976 High Court decision, which had held that company directors could be convicted for CBT under Section 409. This means that the apex court has now ruled that company directors, as well as governing board members or key officers of charities and officers of societies, who commit CBT are only liable to be punished under Section 406. The offence carries a maximum sentence of seven years' imprisonment. In contrast, those who commit CBT under Section 409 may face up to 15 years' jail. In response to the Court of Appeal's decision, the Attorney-General's Chambers said that it would work with relevant government ministries ""on the appropriate revisions to the Penal Code, to ensure that company directors and other persons in similar positions of trust and responsibility are subject to appropriate punishments if they commit criminal breach of trust"". The criminal cases, yes. The decision of the apex court on Feb 1, 2018, was final and brings the long-running saga to a close. Criminal investigations into the case began in 2010. The trial stretched over 142 days, from its start in 2013 to sentencing in November 2015. It is one of the longest criminal cases in history, shorter only than a drug trafficking case in the 1990s that went on for 168 days.","{'neg': 0.085, 'neu': 0.858, 'pos': 0.057, 'compound': -0.9806}",-0.9806
"Pacific Radiance in 'advanced discussions' for US$180m debt funding, to acquire Allianz Marine and Logistics Services",Aug 22 2019,"SINGAPORE - Offshore marine services firm Pacific Radiance on Thursday (Aug 22) said it is in ""advanced discussions"" for at least US$180 million of debt funding. As part of repayment, the group will issue new company shares and/or warrants to the financier, who will own up to 15 per cent of the company's enlarged share capital. Pacific Radiance is also planning to raise additional equity through a share placement with equity investors, with the plans for debt funding and equity subscription forming a part of the company's debt restructuring plan, it added. The new debt and new equity will be used to finance the group's proposed US$180 million acquisition of Allianz Marine and Logistics Services Holding (AMLS) and its subsidiaries and associated companies, repay existing indebtedness, complete notes restructuring and for general corporate and working capital purposes, said the company. AMLS is an Abu Dhabi-headquartered holding company incorporated in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of some 22 subsidiaries and associated companies. It is in the business of integrated offshore logistics solutions and supply-based operations to the offshore oil and gas and construction sectors, with operations covering the Gulf Cooperation Council region, India and Egypt. The vendors selling their stakes in AMLS include Ahmed Tarek Khalil Ali (ATK), a businessman in UAE who owns a 74.44 per cent stake, and AMLS founder Murali Krishna Krishna Kumar, who owns a 22.06 per cent stake. Other vendors include Friedrich Portner, a general manager at AMLS operating subsidiary Allianz Gulf Oil Fields Services who owns 1.5 per cent, and AMLS employees Ramy Mohamed Rashad, a key account director who owns 0.5 per cent, John Garbutt, a logistics director who owns 1 per cent, and Karim Hasabelnabi Mohamed, an operations manager who owns 0.5 per cent. Under the agreement, Mr ATK, existing controlling shareholders as a group, and the financier will be entitled to nominate and appoint the same number of directors to Pacific Radiance's board. As Mr ATK will hold more than 30 per cent of the enlarged voting share capital of Pacific Radiance upon the acquisition's completion, he will be required to make a general offer for shares not already owned. The equity subscription will be subject to a whitewash resolution having been passed by the company's shareholders who are independent of Mr ATK and his concert parties at an extraordinary general meeting and shareholder approval for the share issue. It is also conditional to the Singapore Exchange (SGX) issuing an approval-in-principle regarding the listing and quotation of the new shares. Pacific Radiance added that an independent financial adviser has been appointed to advise on whether or not the whitewash resolution is fair and reasonable, and not prejudicial to the interests of independent shareholders. The company said that its board believes the proposed acquisition would ""create meaningful synergies"" between the group and AMLS, and enhance shareholder value due to the provision of complementary services. This will apply to their combined customer base, and allow sharing of global marketing and sales channels, technologies and management expertise. This comes along aims to expand the group's business and strengthen its foothold globally as it plans to combine its business with that of AMLS. An independent valuer will also be appointed to conduct and furnish a valuation report on AMLS. In addition, the new debt and new equity will also help repay existing debts - including its notes restructuring, and general corporate and working purposes. The debt restructuring plan, meanwhile, will involve the full settlement of Pacific Radiance's bank debt via a cash payment of about US$175.6 million. It will be implemented by way of scheme of arrangement to be proposed between the relevant group entities and their creditors. Due to the new developments, the Singapore High Court has granted an extension of the existing moratoria to Sept 5. The group plans to seek further extension of said moratoria and seek approval in a consent solicitation exercise to extend the final maturity date of its $100 million 4.3 per cent notes due 2019.","{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.86, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.9937}",0.9937
Universities use the donations they receive to supplement bursaries for needy students: Ong Ye Kung,Aug 22 2019,"SINGAPORE - The multi-billion-dollar endowment funds of local universities came under the spotlight on Thursday (Aug 22), when Education Minister Ong Ye Kung was asked why these should not be used to fund more bursaries for needy students. Mr Ong said the universities were already doing this.Sandra Davie Pointing out that endowments play an important role in supplementing the Government's financial aid to needy students, he said many of these bursaries come from the donations received by universities. This is evident in the bursaries that carry the name of the donors. Media reports recently touched on the sizeable amounts in university endowment funds, and some have asked whether universities should still be competing with charities for the ""donations pie"". The Straits Times recently reported that  (NUS), collected $227 million in donations in its financial year that ended in March last year. It had reserves of $9.5 billion and an investment income of $620 million for the year. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) had $3.7 billion in reserves and an investment income of $149 million for the same year. It raised $50 million in donations. Mr Ong said universities such as NUS and NTU also use the income generated from their endowment funds in many other ways - including setting up joint labs with industry partners, incubators to support student entrepreneurs, partnerships with other universities, funding research and student exchanges. He also noted that some universities have much larger endowment funds than the $9.5 billion that NUS holds. Harvard University's endowment, the world's largest, grew 10 per cent to US$39.2 billion (S$54.3 billion) in the financial year which ended in June last year. It was followed by Yale University, whose endowment grew 12.3 per cent to US$29.4 billion in the most recent financial year.

Attempts to skirt car-financing rules not legitimate,Aug 23 2019,"The Straits Times reported that it is legitimate for individuals to register private cars as rental cars in order to be exempted from the car-financing rules ( , Aug 18). Rental cars fall under the broad category of private-hire cars (PHCs), which are used by individuals and companies for hire and reward. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has exempted the purchase of PHCs from the car-financing rules so as to not constrain credit to companies and individuals who rely on the use of PHCs for their businesses and livelihoods. Contrary to what was reported, individuals who exploit the PHC exemption by registering private cars as rental cars with no intent of running a genuine business are deemed to be circumventing the car-financing rules. This is neither above board nor legitimate. MAS takes a serious view of attempts to circumvent the car-financing rules, and individuals should not carry out such acts. Individuals who do so are liable for higher charges compared with purchasing a private car. PHC owners have to pay higher interest rates on their car loans and higher premiums on their commercial car insurance. MAS is looking into measures to curb circumvention of the car-financing rules. We reiterate the need for individuals to ensure that they can afford the debt they are taking on to finance major purchases such as cars.

"Survey: Firms expecting falling revenues, rising business costs",Aug 21 2019,"More Singapore businesses are expecting a drop in their revenue and profit margin as the economy slows, with trade tensions being a top concern among them.Grace Ho These were findings from a survey of more than 970 respondents released yesterday by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI).Seow Bei Yi As companies gear up for rising business costs amid policy changes and slowing growth, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said in a Facebook post that ministers from the Finance Ministry will continue to engage businesses, unions and other stakeholders. Upcoming changes include a raise in the retirement and re-employment ages, and the Government will develop a support package to help companies with the transition, he said. While companies are expecting business costs to go up with these changes, the SCCCI's annual business survey this year also found that close to 40 per cent of those polled between May and July foresee a fall in revenue, up from around 27 per cent last year. About 70 per cent of the firms said they are facing the challenge of rising business costs as well, while around 55 per cent forecast a dip in profits this year, the group's president Roland Ng said at its annual SME Conference yesterday. ""This survey reflects the effects from the slowing down in Singapore's economy,"" he added. While 60 per cent of the businesses polled indicated they will retain their present employees, 17 per cent said they will cut back on manpower. ""In such a business environment, the topmost concerns of the respondents are how to grow their revenue, innovation of products and services, attraction and retention of workers, and how to digitalise their businesses,"" said Mr Ng.

Oil CEOs push carbon-capture efforts ahead of climate talks,Sep 23 2019," (This September 23 story corrects to change title for Matthew Stevenson from CEO to VP Finance at Inventys.) By Jessica Resnick-Ault NEW YORK () - A group of 13 major oil companies charted out a plan on Monday to promote investments in carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS), ahead of a gathering in New York. Oil chiefs grappling with growing demand for action to fight climate change have looked to invest in carbon-capture and sequestration techniques that some executives, including Occidental Petroleum Corp () CEO Vicki Hollub, say could make drilling carbon neutral. With fossil fuel development growing worldwide, the oil and gas industry faces growing criticism from activists concerned about accelerating climate impacts from melting ice caps to sea-level rise and extreme weather. Scientists say the world needs to halve greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade to avoid catastrophic warming. Carbon dioxide emissions hit a record 37 billion tonnes in 2018, with emissions from oil and gas reaching 12.8 billion tonnes that year, according to a United Nations Science Advisory Panel released Sunday.  Carbon sequestration technology traps carbon in caverns or porous spaces underground. A number of oil and gas CEOs say the technology will be crucial to meeting goals set in the 2016 Paris agreement on climate change to reduce global emissions.  “A lot of people don't even know what CCUS is. I think the world is going to hear more and more and more about it,” BP plc () CEO Bob Dudley said. “I don't think we can meet the Paris goals without CCUS.”  The group, known as the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), said it aims to double the amount of carbon dioxide stored globally by 2030. The group is also taking steps to reduce methane emissions and increase energy efficiency. The group formed in 2014 to support efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Its gathering will be held on the sidelines of a climate summit, where United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says he is banking on new pledges from governments and businesses to abandon fossil fuels. Last Friday, millions of young people flooded the streets of cities around the world to demand urgent steps to stop climate change. Many, including 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, have criticized governments and industries for not doing enough. The OGCI group said in a statement that carbon-capture technologies could be expanded to more efficiently trap large amounts of carbon released by facilities such as power plants, which could then be used in oil recovery and, ultimately stored - thus, removing it from the atmosphere.  The group plans to work with others to put carbon-capture techniques into operation in the United States, United Kingdom, Norway, the Netherlands, and China. On Monday afternoon in New York, it will sign a declaration of collaboration with certain energy ministers and other stakeholders, to commit to efforts to expand carbon storage. “High capital cost is currently a barrier to widespread deployment of carbon capture,” said Matthew Stevenson, Vice President of finance and corporate strategy at Inventys, a company developing a lower-cost carbon capture technology. The company is among those that has received an investment from the OGCI's investment arm. The OGCI companies, which include Exxon Mobil Corp (), Chevron Corp () and BP PLC (), account for 32% of global oil and gas production. They have agreed to cooperate to accelerate reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  Separately, almost 90 big companies in sectors from food to cement to telecommunications are pledging to slash greenhouse gas emissions, organizers said.

It is considering setting a target for inflation once it moves to the next stage of its currency flotation, Central Bank Governor Abdellatif Jouahri said at a new conference without giving further details. Last year Morocco widened the band in which the dirham trades against hard currencies to 2.5% either side of a reference price, and has said it will widen that band further. Jouahri said there should be “more vigilance regarding public debt”, which stands at 65.7% of gross domestic product after climbing to 66% last year. Economic growth is set to slow to 2.7% in 2019 from 3% in 2018 as a result of agricultural activity slowing, the bank said. Morocco announced a cereals harvest of 5.2 million tonnes this year, about half the size of last year's due to a lack of rainfall. However, economic growth should increase again in 2020 to 3.8%, the bank said, assuming a crop of 8 million tonnes of cereals. The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 5.1% in 2019 and 3.6% in 2020, from 5.5% in 2018, the bank said. The gaps should shrink because of cheaper energy imports and a rise in exports, notably from the automotive sector. The central bank maintained that Morocco will still issue two international bonds this year and next year that would boost international reserves to 239 billion dirhams in 2019 and 234.5 in 2020, enough to cover five months of imports. The government plans to issue two international sovereign bonds in 2019 and 2020, each worth 11 billion dirhams ($1 billion). The budget deficit, excluding privatisation revenue, is expected to rise to 4% of GDP in 2019 from 3.7% in 2018, the central bank said, citing an increase in spending after public sector wage increases.

Lebanese millers say wheat reserves fall due to 'dollar problem',Sep 24 2019,"BEIRUT () - Lebanese millers said on Tuesday wheat stocks had fallen to a dangerous level, warning the country may face a supply crisis unless dollars needed to import the grain are supplied at the official rate, the National News Agency reported. In a statement, the Lebanese millers' association urged  officials to find a solution for dollars to be supplied at the official price “so the owners of the mills can resume their work and import the country's wheat need”. The Lebanese pound has been pegged against the dollar at a level of 1,507.5 pounds for more than two decades. Dollars and pounds are legal tender in Lebanon. Lebanese central bank governor Riad Salameh said on Monday that dollars are available and banks were meeting customer demand. The central bank had not received any official complaints about dollar availability, he said. Distributors of fuel, also complaining they are unable to secure their dollar needs at that price, went on strike last week, saying a lack of dollars at the official exchange rate was forcing them to pay more at money exchange houses.     The millers' association said it was determined to supply flour to bakeries at the official Lebanese pound price “but the problem is that converting Lebanese pounds to U.S. dollars has become very costly”. This had led millers to issue invoices in U.S. dollars “to preserve operating capital and the continuation of our work”. “The wheat reserve at the mills has fallen to a level that represents a danger, and this may expose the country to a supply crisis if the U.S. dollar problem is not resolved,” it said. The Lebanese economy has suffered from a slowdown in capital inflows from abroad that have long been used to finance the government budget and current account deficit.  The central bank's foreign assets, excluding gold, fell around 15% from an all-time high in May last year to $38.7 billion in mid-September.  Hassan Assaf, a member of the millers' association, said banks had been gradually curbing supply of dollars for two months. Wheat reserves held by private millers had fallen to 1-1/2 to two months of supply from four months, he told . “We can't place import requests because we cannot secure dollars to open credit lines,” he said.  Prices charged by money exchange houses for dollars had touched as high as 1,580 pounds, he said. ","{'neg': 0.12, 'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.036, 'compound': -0.9851}",-0.9851
Police fire water cannon as Indonesians rally against new laws,Sep 24 2019,"JAKARTA () - Indonesian police fired water cannon and tear gas to break up protests on Tuesday, as tens of thousands of students gathered in cities nationwide over issues that included a new criminal code that penalizes adultery and revised laws on corruption. President Joko Widodo on Friday ordered a delay in parliament's vote on the new criminal code, which would replace a Dutch colonial-era set of laws, saying a new parliament should deliberate on the bill next month.  The revisions to the code also include penalties for sex outside marriage, insulting the president's dignity, a four-year jail term for abortions in the absence of a medical emergency or rape, and a prison term for black magic. Though the vote was not included in Tuesday's plenary session in parliament, some lawmakers have said they would try to come up with a new draft to bring it to a vote before their current term ends at the end of this month. Students, often wearing colorful jackets from their alma maters, gathered in cities across the country. One banner held by a woman in a photo posted on social media read: “My crotch does not belong to the government”. Thousands gathered in the front and back entrances to Jakarta's parliament building, demanding to meet with parliament speaker Bambang Soesatyo. Soesatyo held a news conference inside the building urging calm, but refused to answer questions from reporters on whether the vote would be delayed until new parliament takes office, repeating the vote could happen in the current term. Police then fired water cannon and tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd. Indonesia's benchmark stock index dropped more than 1% on Tuesday, amid worries over domestic political tensions, said Fakhrul Fulvian, an economist with Trimegah Sekuritas.  Finance Minister Sri Mulyani told reporters she hoped “the things that triggered (the demonstrations) can be discussed through the available political process so there won't be a wider impact on sentiment.”  On the main street through the capital Jakarta, hundreds of others were marching down toward parliament after protesting in front of the presidential palace, blocking traffic. “We're going to parliament to oppose the new law for the anti-corruption agency that are not pro-people but are pro-corruptors,” Fuad Wahyudin, 21-year-old student from an Islamic university in West Java, told . “The criminal code is the same, it doesn't side with the people,” said Wahyudin.  Though the president had ordered a delay in the criminal code, Wahyudin said he wanted to make sure parliament does not pass the bill into law until they change it to reflect demand from protesters. President Widodo told Indonesians this month he would not compromise in the fight against graft, amid concerns over the officer picked to head the anti-corruption agency and proposed changes curbing its right to wiretap suspects without a warrant. Police also fired tear gas to disperse thousands of protesters in Bandung, West Java, who hurled rocks at officers near a local parliament building. Students had stayed in front of Jakarta's parliament until nearly midnight on Monday, breaking part of the fence and blocking a toll road. Media reports said more than 5,000 police personnel have been deployed to maintain security in Jakarta. ","{'neg': 0.132, 'neu': 0.845, 'pos': 0.023, 'compound': -0.9955}",-0.9955
Explainer: What is causing Cuba's acute shortage of fuel?,Sep 24 2019,"() - Long lines of drivers at gas stations in Cuba and hours of wait for public transport are signs of the impact of sanctions imposed by the United States this year on the Caribbean island and its main ally, oil producer Venezuela.  President Miguel Diaz-Canel this month warned Cubans of difficult times ahead due to limited fuel imports. He exhorted citizens to show solidarity and do their utmost to improve energy efficiency. Cuba has relied for decades on crude purchases from allies to feed its refineries. It also imports fuel to help satisfy consumption of about 145,000 barrels per day by power plants, industrial complexes, gas stations, airports and homes. Fuel shortages have gradually grown worse since Cuba's main ally, Venezuela, started reducing oil shipments as far back as 2016 after its own production declined and its economy slipped into a deep recession.  A bilateral pact signed in 2000 allows Cuba to pay for Venezuelan oil imports by offering services to the South American country ranging from doctors to advisers.  Venezuela had until 2015 supplied Cuba with about 90,000 bpd of crude and fuel. But a first round of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela in 2017 limited PDVSA's access to financing, aggravating its output decline and curtailing investment in the industry. As of 2017, Cuba produced just 51,000 bpd of crude, according to the most recent available data from the country's National Office of Statistic and Information.  Analysts say it is hard for Cuba to cover the shortfall with its fuel consumption by importing at market prices, given it is strapped for cash. Faced with fuel shortages, the country has implemented a series of austerity measures in recent years like cutting public street lighting and air conditioning usage in state institutions. The Trump administration imposed sanctions in January banning U.S. firms or U.S. subsidiaries of foreign firms from selling fuel to Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA both for domestic consumption and for re-exports. The measures also ban any trade in dollars with PDVSA or its units. Washington in July also sanctioned specific vessel operators covering the Venezuela-Cuba route and the entity receiving Venezuelan oil, state-run Cubametales. The nations have since struggled to find tankers to transport the oil. Cuba imports not only crude from Venezuela but also gasoline, diesel, fuel oil, lubricants and cooking gas, according to internal PDVSA data.   Yes. But volumes have decreased. Venezuela this has sent year some 55,300 bpd of crude and fuel to Cuba, below the average of the last decade, according to internal PDVSA data and Refinitiv Eikon data.  In 2018, PDVSA supplied Cubametales with some 89,000 bpd of crude and products, according to PDVSA's internal data. PDVSA in turn has increasingly had to import refined fuel for its own domestic market, according to company data. PDVSA is no using a large portion of its own fleet to transport Venezuelan crude and fuel to Cuba, including tankers Manuela Saenz, Icaro, Terepaima and Yare.  Vessels owned by a joint Venezuela-Cuba transportation company, Transalba, also are covering the route, but the number of vessels operators and maritime crew willing to touch Venezuelan or Cuban ports has decreased in recent months due to the sanctions, according to shippers. Yes, but the island still overwhelmingly relies on oil supplies from Venezuela.  From July through mid-September, Cuba imported 50,000-100,000 bpd, mostly from PDVSA. Vessels loaded with imports coming from Russian ports, Caribbean terminals and oil hubs such as Rotterdam also arrived at Cuban ports in recent weeks, according to the Refinitiv data.   was unable to identify all the companies chartering vessels to the island. Cuba's president has said the situation should normalize in October as shipments have already been guaranteed for that month.  Analysts are not so confident. Cuba does not have a large number of oil suppliers since the U.S. government imposed an embargo on the island nearly 60 years ago and growing problems to find vessels are creating new obstacles to imports.  The country is also strapped for cash. Other than Venezuela, Algeria historically has supplied up to 5,000 bpd as barter, mostly for ophthalmology services received from Cuba, said Jorge Pinon from the University of Austin in Texas.  Cuba this month reduced the frequency of public transport and cut industrial production in order to save energy so it can ensure basic services like hospitals and food distribution. Government officials have been encouraging citizens to make the most of natural daylight to save electricity and have urged the use of more animal power to save on diesel. So far, there have been no major blackouts. The president has warned there could be but, if so, said they will be planned and announced beforehand.

"Sanctions depress Russia's rating by ""at least one notch"" - Fitch",Sep 24 2019,"MOSCOW, Sept 24 () - Western sanctions constrain Russia's credit rating and hamper its efforts to achieve higher rates of economic growth, global rating agency Fitch said on Tuesday. Fitch lifted Russia's investment-grade rating in August to ‘BBB' from ‘BBB-‘, citing a ‍strengthened policy mix and robust fiscal and external balance sheets. But economic and financial sanctions that the West has gradually imposed on Russia since 2014 to punish it for the annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and other “malign activities” represent headwinds for Russia's growth and rating prospects. “These sanctions subtract at least one notch from Russia's rating, as predicted by our sovereign rating model,” Erich Arispe, Senior Director of Fitch Ratings Sovereign Group, told  in Moscow. Russian officials say the sanctions are unlawful and deny any wrongdoing in Ukraine or elsewhere. “We believe that sanctions are going to remain and are going to continue to constrain Russia's credit profile from the economic side,” Arispe said. “As sovereign debt has already been targeted ... further sanctions on this cannot be discounted.” The United States last slapped sanctions on Russia in August by banning U.S. banks from buying sovereign Eurobonds directly from Russia to punish Moscow for the poisoning of a former Russian double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, in Britain last year. Arispe said sanctions were viewed as a long-term factor and an element of Russia's credit profile. Rated as BBB, which is two notches above junk territory, Russia is now on a par with countries such as Hungary, Italy and Mexico. While public finances and external finances are “significantly stronger” in Russia, which has more than $500 billion in state reserves, than in other countries with BBB ratings, growth remains Russia's weak point, Arispe said. “This represents the main policy challenge from our perspective: How to increase growth prospects without undermining improvements in terms of macroeconomic stability,” Arispe said. The Russian central bank has projected economic growth at around 1% in 2019, down from 2.3% seen in 2018. ","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.84, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': 0.8872}",0.8872
Banks line up £1.4bn financing for possible LGC sale,Sep 24 2019,"LONDON, Sept 24 (LPC) - Bankers are working on debt financings totalling around £1.4bn-equivalent to back a potential sale of UK forensic sciences group LGC as potential buyers get set to submit bids. KKR acquired LGC from Bridgepoint in December 2015 and has put the company up for sale, with first round bids due on October 8 in an auction process. Advent, Bain, Blackstone, Carlyle, Cinven, EQT and H&F are expected to submit bids for the company, which has also attracted the attention of trade buyers including medical device makers Thermo Fisher Scientific and Danaher, banking sources said. All of the private equity firms and trade buyers either declined to comment or were not immeditaley available to comment. JP Morgan, HSBC and KKR Capital Markets are expected to provide a staple financing backing a possible sale that will be offered to all sponsors. The staple financing is expected to comprise senior and junior leveraged loans denominated in euros and dollars. It will total around 7.5-7.75 times LGC's approximate £165m-£170m Ebitda, the sources said. Other banks are also working on financing packages of similar levels to back private equity firms looking to bid. At 7.5-7.75 times, the leverage levels are quite aggressive, but LGC is a strong performer that is well known to the leveraged loan market, banking sources said. “LGC is awesome. Every bank will want a piece of it,” a syndicate head said. LGC last tapped the loan market in July 2019 when it raised an incremental €210m-equivalent leveraged loan to fund upcoming acquisitions. KKR was sole arranger of the loans, with Wilmington Trust acting as agent. After that, LGC's complete capital structure comprised a US$420m TLB paying 350bp over Libor; a €490m TLB paying 325bp over Euribor; a €115m TLB paying 400bp over Euribor; a €145m second-lien paying 650bp over Euribor; and a US$105m second-lien paying 675bp over Libor.

UK borrowing plans thrown off target by higher spending and student loans,Sep 24 2019,"LONDON () - The British government's plan to keep its budget deficit under 2% of national income was thrown off course on Tuesday when  statisticians sharply revised up borrowing figures and highlighted rising public spending. The tricky news for new finance minister Sajid Javid - just weeks before Britain is due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31 - shows borrowing on the rise even ahead of the big spending rises he announced earlier this month take effect. The Office for National Statistics revised up its estimate of government borrowing for the last financial year to 1.9% of gross domestic product from 1.1%, largely due to a ruling that billions of pounds of student loans are unlikely to be repaid. While the change to the treatment of student loans had been long planned, the effect was amplified by new accounting for public-sector pensions and the discovery that revenue from tax on company profits last year had been overstated. “Combined with the spending increases announced in the spending round, (this) suggests that the chancellor's fiscal target is dead in the water,” economist Andrew Wishart of consultancy Capital Economics said. Earlier this month Javid told parliament he still aimed to keep public borrowing below 2% of GDP during the next financial year, even after announcing plans to raise day-to-day spending on public services by more than 4% above inflation. Javid said he was “turning the page on austerity” as he promised the biggest spending increases in 15 years, a move widely seen as part of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's push for an early election to break the Brexit impasse.  Despite the statistical revisions, British public borrowing last year remained the lowest since 2001/02, down from a peak of 10.2% of GDP reached in 2009/10 just after the depths of the financial crisis. Borrowing for August alone was also slightly lower than economists polled by  had expected, at 6.418 billion pounds versus a forecast 7.15 billion pounds. This was down 7% from last August, but cumulative borrowing since this financial year started in April was up by 28% on the same period in 2018 at 31.2 billion pounds. Total borrowing last year was 41.4 billion pounds, on the new ONS calculations. “Stronger than expected spending growth is fuelling a faster rise in the deficit than we forecast in March,” said the Office for Budget Responsibility, which is in charge of government budget forecasts. The OBR said it estimated the ONS's statistical changes would add at least 15 billion pounds a year to British public borrowing, though it will not produce fully revised forecasts until Javid holds his first budget later this year. On Saturday the Financial Times reported Javid wanted to hold this during the week starting Oct. 21, but that this would hinge on parliament having approved a deal to leave the EU. If a no-deal Brexit was probable, the budget would be delayed until afterwards, when the impact was clearer. In July the OBR predicted borrowing could jump by 30 billion pounds a year by 2020/21 if Britain leaves the EU without a transition deal on Oct. 31, triggering a recession. Tuesday's statistical changes had less impact on public sector net debt, the total amount of money that Britain's government owes. This stood at 1.78 trillion pounds or 80.9% of GDP in August, excluding public-sector banks, down from a post-financial crisis peak of 85.1% in October 2017 but still double pre-crisis levels.

Indonesia sets aside $700 million as fiscal buffer in 2020 budget,Sep 24 2019,"JAKARTA () - Indonesia has set aside 10 trillion rupiah ($708.72 million) as a buffer for fiscal risks next year, a 43% increase from such an  allocation this year, due to global economic uncertainty, a finance ministry official said on Tuesday. Parliament passed the government's 2020 budget of $180.3 billion earlier on Tuesday with a fiscal deficit 1.8% of gross domestic product, which officials have said was designed to anticipate a global economic slowdown. The budget is President Joko Widodo's first for his second term and already contained allocations for programs he promised when running for re-election before a presidential vote in April.  The buffer can be used if any of the government's macroeconomic assumptions misses forecasts, affecting revenue collection or ballooning subsidies. “If the deficit rises, we can use it to make sure it stays below 3%,” said Askolani, director general of budgeting at the ministry. By law, Indonesia's fiscal deficit cannot be above 3% of GDP. Askolani, who goes by one name, said the buffer could also be used if there is a change in government policy or for  emergency responses to disasters. Among approved assumptions for the budget are 5.3% economic growth, an annual average rupiah trading rate of 14,400 a dollar and a $63 per barrel annual average price for Indonesian crude oil. In a news conference detailing the budget, finance ministry officials said 2020 allocations for infrastructure investment was 423.3 trillion rupiah, up only 2% from this year's 415 trillion. This include a 3.5 trillion rupiah capital injection to state construction firm Hutama Karya and a 5 trillion rupiah injection to state power utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara. Total allotted funds for 2020 social programs, which could support domestic consumption, was 372.5 trillion rupiah, the officials said. President Widodo's program to hand out cards to 2 million young people to obtain free skills training received a 10 trillion rupiah budget, officials said. The government has partnered with digital unicorns such as ride-hailing and mobile payment firm Go-Jek and e-commerce Tokopedia to provide the training, they said.

"Turkey points to longer-term bond issues after rates fall, investors say",Sep 24 2019,"ANKARA, Sept 24 () - Investors who met Turkish authorities this week said they expect the Treasury to start issuing longer-term bonds after recent sharp cuts in interest rates, and that further rate reductions by the central bank would be moderate. The Treasury's average cost of domestic lira borrowing with a fixed interest rate fell to 20.4% in July, according to the most recent data, after climbing to a high of 25.8% in April. Bankers estimate the current rate has fallen below 20%, along with declining inflation and more stable exchange rates. The Treasury last issued a 10-year bond in July 2018. It has since preferred shorter-term bonds to limit the long-term impact of the cost of borrowing. Its average weighted maturity term fell to 28.9 months on average this year, from 71.4 months in January 2018. “The Treasury and Finance Ministry will begin holding five- and 10-year bond auctions as of next year and it is therefore foreseen that foreign demand for government bonds will increase substantially,” one investor who attended the meetings said. The investor, one of three who spoke to  after the meetings, also said he got the impression that the Treasury may switch some short-term bonds issued in the first months of next year with longer-term debt. After raising its policy rate to 24% in September last year to stop a rise in inflation and put a floor under the ailing lira, the central bank has cut its policy rate by 750 basis points in total since July. Another investor said the central bank's messages during the meetings gave the impression that rate cuts were mostly over. “We understand that they foresee more restrained adjustments with a focus on data ... regarding interest rates from now,” the investor said. “We also understand from the central bank's comments that they could lower their year-end (inflation) forecast, which is 13.9%, to 12 to 13%. Monetary policy is being shaped according to 8% inflation for next year.” Turkey's central bank did not comment when asked about the meetings. The Treasury and Finance Ministry's new three-year economic programme, which it announces every year, is expected to be based on 5% growth for next year, the investor said. Two other investors who attended the meetings said they had got the impression that a new draft law that would increase the Treasury's borrowing limit could be introduced in parliament after the programme is announced.

German downturn 'taking a breather' but recession still looms: Ifo,Sep 24 2019,"BERLIN () - German business morale rose in September for the first time in six months but Europe's largest economy is still likely slipping into recession as the U.S.-China trade conflict and Brexit bite, the Ifo economic institute said on Tuesday. Ifo's business climate index rose to 94.6 from 94.3 in August, snapping a run of five consecutive falls. September's reading compared with a consensus forecast for 94.4. “The downturn is taking a breather,” Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement. But he added: “In manufacturing, the business climate has only one direction: downward.” Germany's export-reliant economy is suffering from slower global growth and business uncertainty caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's ‘America First' trade policies and Britain's planned, but delayed, exit from the European Union. Ifo's current conditions index rose to 98.5 from 97.4 in August but its expectations index fell to 90.8 from 91.3. Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said the German economy is likely to shrink again in the third quarter. That would put it in recession - usually defined as a period of at least two consecutive quarters of contraction - after it shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter. “This is not the start of a change of trend,” Wohlrabe said of Tuesday's firmer overall sentiment reading. “The slowdown is only taking a break,” he told , adding that no signs of improvement were to be seen for German industry. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, speaking immediately after the release of the Ifo data, said Germany's growth dynamics have deteriorated but insisted: “We are not in a recession.”  Much of the German economy's fortunes are tied up in factors beyond its control: mainly weaker global growth, developments in the U.S.-China trade conflict and the question of whether Britain can achieve an orderly exit from the European Union. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that he and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He for trade talks in two weeks. On Brexit, EU negotiator Michel Barnier struck a downbeat note on Tuesday, saying there was no reason to be optimistic that Britain and the bloc will find a solution to the thorny question of the Irish “backstop”. ING economist Carsten Brzeski said the likelihood of a third quarter contraction in Germany was rising “almost by the day”. On Monday, a purchasing managers' survey showed that German private sector activity shrank for the first time in 6-1/2 years in September as a manufacturing recession deepened unexpectedly and growth in the service sector lost momentum. Highlighting the weakness in the manufacturing sector, engineering lobby group VDMA also said on Monday production in Germany's engineering sector will decline by 2% both this year and in 2020. It cited trade conflicts and uncertainties linked to Britain's planned exit from the EU. “While a ‘light' technical recession is not the end of the world for an economy which has been growing for more than 10 years and has an unemployment rate at all-time lows, it is the lack of any signals of an imminent rebound which is more concerning,” Brzeski said. “Calls for government action will continue,” he added. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said earlier this month Germany is ready to pump “many, many billions of euros” into its economy to counter any significant slowdown in growth. But on Friday, the government said a new package of measures to protect the climate would be budget-neutral and that it was sticking to its ‘black zero' balanced-budget policy, dashing economists' hopes for a fiscal splurge.

"U.N. runs clubs for Libyan children, after conflict disrupts schools",Sep 24 2019,"Tripoli () - Libyan mother Halima al-Miladi wants to keep her 7-year-old son distracted from the fighting in and around the capital Tripoli where they live. So she jumped at a chance for him to play football, draw, and play with other children at special clubs organized in the city's schools by the United Nations.  “I pushed my son to participate in the club away from the conditions that the country is going through,” she said. This year, many classes were disrupted by the conflict as some school buildings were used as shelters for thousands of displaced people, leaving many children with nowhere to go. Around 1,000 Libyan children now attend such clubs, located in the center of Tripoli, which is calmer than the south.  In April, commander Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) launched a military offensive to take control of Tripoli, home to the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA), which was set up in 2016 after a U.N.-backed political deal. At al-Jihad primary school in the Sooq Juma municipality, students practiced music and sports. A group of young children sat around a table, busy with handicrafts. “The children are affected by what is happening, and through these activities we have tried to integrate them and they have improved,” said Amal Ben Sasi, a counselor at another school, the Ben Ashour school. Ghada Faghi Hassan, the school principal, said teachers were giving donations to support the summer clubs. “We promised parents to cover the cost of breakfast and the teachers supported it because the club is for free,” Hassan said. Teachers are also financing entertainment and trips for the children. Ibrahim Farah, an educational specialist at UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, said the summer club program targeted 1,000 pupils in two municipalities.

Her more recent roles on TV include “Suddenly Susan,” “Lipstick Jungle” and “Law & Order: SVU.” For the latest in ' Life Lessons series, we spoke with Shields, 54, to talk about her past, present and future life in the spotlight. Q: How did you handle success at such a young age? A: Because I never had relative anonymity, it never came as a total shock. It was more of a gradual understanding of how that part of my life was going to work.  Q: How did you and your mom, who was your manager, approach wealth? A: My mom didn't really have a financial background, and to her owning land was the most important thing. She had very romantic visions, such as what it would be like to have a ranch in Montana. At one point we had like six properties – it was insane. When I started paying closer attention to money, we had to liquidate a lot of that. Luckily I still had the potential to earn. Q: Did financial advisers help steer you in the right direction? A: I was never cognizant of how diversified I was. So I found advisers who helped put me in a position where I never had to make risky career decisions. They help me grow my money consistently, without going for big windfalls, which I'm totally fine with. And my husband and I both continue to work at a heavy rate. Q: You've been very public about your struggle with depression – what life lessons did that period teach you? A: This was something that flattened me. All of a sudden hard work, and a good attitude, and a great education were just not enough. It is important to be able to say that you need help, or that you are not feeling strong. There is still shame around that, and I only got released from that shame myself by sharing my story with others. Q: You are now a spokesperson for Life Happens, which raises awareness around life insurance, so what is your message there? A: There is a real stigma surrounding the idea of life insurance, because people don't like to talk about death. My mother, for instance, never talked about it. But I always knew that if I ever had children, I would want to protect them. Many people seem to think that life insurance is cost-prohibitive – but it's not. Life is so unpredictable, and it's good to give yourself peace of mind. Q: What charities do you devote your resources to these days? A: I work with one called Win (Women In Need) in NYC, which helps women in dire financial straits. It houses them, and provides a safe place for their children, so they can get out and work. Many people are homeless because housing is so expensive in New York City, and they have been financially displaced. A big portion of the city's homeless are women with children, and a lot of people are surprised to find that out. Q: What do you envision retirement looking like? A: They are going to have to pull me off the stage. The idea of retirement is kind of like death to me; I can't even wrap my mind around it. Work is a huge part of my identity, having done it for 53 years now. It's like a blood source to me. Q: Since you have two teenagers, what life lessons do you try to pass along to them? A: Maintain your integrity, be present, and keep things simple. Everyone has a tendency to make things so complicated. Just work as hard as you can, don't take handouts, and surround yourself with good people. ","{'neg': 0.043, 'neu': 0.839, 'pos': 0.118, 'compound': 0.9944}",0.9944
Aviation emissions to take center stage at Montreal gathering as protests loom,Sep 24 2019,"MONTREAL, Sept 24 () - A global deal to curb carbon emissions from flying will take center stage as the U.N. aviation agency's triennial assembly opens on Tuesday in Montreal under the shadow of protests led by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg later in the week. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which holds an assembly every three years, set out a major climate initiative at its last full gathering in 2016, but aviation leaders are under pressure to do more after overall carbon emissions hit record highs last year. The plan, known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the first of its kind for a single industry, is a medium-term scheme to help airlines avoid adding to their net emissions from 2020. But the European Union and some campaigners and members of the industry itself want ICAO to commit now to setting longer-term goals to reduce emissions at its 2022 assembly. “Every sector of the economy needs to step up to help meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, and governments have not developed a plan to help the aviation industry do that,” said Brad Schallert, deputy director of International Climate Cooperation at the World Wildlife Fund. Thunberg, the teenage climate activist who admonished world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly in New York for failing to protect the environment, will lead a street protest in Montreal on Friday. Commercial flying accounts for 2.5% of carbon emissions. With passenger numbers forecast to double to 8.2 billion by 2037, experts say emissions will rise if no action is taken. The United States, which quit the Paris accord in 2017, backs the U.N.-negotiated CORSIA, which is supported by most airlines and would cap rising aviation emissions at 2020 levels through the purchase of carbon offsets. However, U.S. support is tied to other major aviation countries also backing the plan and a guarantee that CORSIA would prevent airlines from being subjected to separate and more costly carbon tax schemes by individual countries, a U.S. State Department official said. Europe, meanwhile, wants to keep its right to run separate emissions schemes. “We support CORSIA being a first step, a minimum at this stage,” said Pascal Canfin, chair of the environment committee of the European Parliament. “But we believe our sovereignty allows us to be more ambitious if we wish to be so, and this is something that all ICAO members should respect,” Canfin said. ICAO cannot impose regulations but sets standards that are approved by its 193 member countries. The assembly runs from Sept. 24 through Oct. 4.

"Starbucks wins, Fiat loses in EU tax fights",Sep 24 2019,"LUXEMBOURG () - Starbucks () won its fight on Tuesday against an EU demand to pay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) in Dutch back taxes, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles () lost its challenge against an order to stump up a similar amount to Luxembourg. Both cases were part of European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager's crackdown on unlawful tax breaks offered by EU countries to multinationals, which has also extended to Apple's () Irish deal and Amazon's () Luxembourg deal, among others. The judgments show that the General Court, Europe's second-highest court, in general endorses the European Commission's methodology in its tax crackdown but stipulates the Commission must do its homework properly to prove its case - potentially a bad omen for Apple fighting a record 13-billion-euro Irish tax order. It is an important legal victory for the Commission, said Dimitrios Kyriazis, head of Law Faculty at New College of the Humanities London. “Regardless of the outcome of individual cases, the General Court seems to have sanctioned the Commission's approach,” he said. In Starbucks' case, the EU competition enforcer failed to show that the U.S. coffee chain benefited unfairly from the Dutch tax deal, the court said. “The Commission was unable to demonstrate the existence of an advantage in favor of Starbucks,” judges said. The Dutch finance ministry said the judgment showed that the multinational was treated the same as other companies. Starbucks also welcomed the ruling, saying it had not received any special tax treatment from the Netherlands and that it “pays all of its taxes wherever they are due”. In a separate ruling, the Court upheld the Commission's decision against Fiat's Luxembourg's tax deal, saying that the Commission had applied its state aid rules correctly to assess if there was an illegal advantage and was not seeking to harmonize tax rules across the bloc, an argument cited by critics. It also agreed with the Commission's finding that the Luxembourg tax ruling was a selective one, meaning that such rulings were not available to all companies, a key argument used by companies ordered to pay back taxes. Luxembourg said it would analyze the judgment and reserved all its rights. Fiat Chrysler Finance Europe said it was disappointed with the judgment and was considering its next steps, adding that the matter was not material to the group. Vestager said the court endorsed the Commission's approach in using state aid rules in tax cases, adding however that a more comprehensive strategy was needed to tackle tax avoidance. “The ultimate goal that all companies pay their fair share of tax can only be achieved by a combination of efforts to make legislative changes, enforce state aid rules and a change in corporate philosophies,” she said.  The Commission in its 2015 decisions said Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler set prices for goods and services sold between subsidiaries, known as transfer prices, that were below market rates and which artificially lowered their taxes. The losing side can appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union on points of law. Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Ireland are among countries whose economies have benefited from attracting multinationals. They have amended their tax regimes in recent years following the EU tax drive. The European Commission is currently investigating Ikea AB IKEA.UL and Nike Inc's () Dutch deals and Huhtamaki Oyi's () Luxembourg tax ruling. The cases are T-755/15 Luxembourg v Commission and T-759/15 Fiat Chrysler Finance Europe v Commission, and T-760/15 Netherlands v Commission and T-636/16 Starbucks and Starbucks Manufacturing Emea v Commission.

"Australia audits PayPal for money laundering, terror law compliance",Sep 24 2019,"SYDNEY () - Australia's financial intelligence agency on Tuesday ordered an audit of PayPal Holdings Inc's compliance with local anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws, saying it was concerned reporting obligations had not been met. AUSTRAC, which is tasked with ensuring compliance with the  laws, ordered PayPal's Australian unit to appoint an external auditor to look at the fund transfers at its own cost and report back within 120 days. AUSTRAC said in a statement that International Funds Transfer Instructions reported by the financial sector provided intelligence that enabled the agency and its partners to combat serious crimes, such as child sex exploitation. “Regulated businesses like PayPal Australia, who facilitate payments and transactions for millions of Australian customers every year, play a critical role in helping AUSTRAC and our law enforcement partners stop the movement of money to criminals and terrorists,” AUSTRAC Chief Executive Nicole Rose said in a statement. PayPal said its Australian unit reported itself to authorities after an internal review found an issue with the way it reported international fund transfers to AUSTRAC. It said suggestions the reason for the audit was the discovery of child sex exploitation connections were not correct. “We are working in full cooperation with AUSTRAC to remediate this reporting system issue and to undertake the audit as outlined by AUSTRAC in the time specified,” PayPal's senior communications director, Amanda Christine Miller, said in an email.  The audit would have no impact on customers, Miller added. U.S.-based PayPal operates a worldwide online payment service which connects buyers and sellers through a secure online wallet linked to both parties' bank accounts. A preliminary report from a separate review ordered by AUSTRAC into buy-now-pay-later company Afterpay Touch Group in June, citing suspected non-compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws, was due to be handed to AUSTRAC on Tuesday. Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) players let shoppers purchase products without paying upfront, and without the regulatory hurdle of applying for a credit card or loan, raising concerns about shopper identity. AUSTRAC and Afterpay did not immediately respond to questions about that review. Australian regulators are under sustained pressure to act after the Royal Commission inquiry into financial sector misconduct widely condemned their performance in recent years. The Royal Commission found that when misconduct by financial institutions was revealed, it either went unpunished or the regulatory consequences did not reflect the seriousness of what had been done.

UPDATE 1-Tech entrepreneurs to set up Israel's first new bank in 40 years,Sep 24 2019,"(Adds details, quotes, background) By Tova Cohen TEL AVIV, Sept 24 () - Two tech entrepreneurs are set to establish Israel's first new bank in 40 years after the central bank said on Tuesday it approved the plan as part of efforts to spur competition in the sector. The new digital bank is being set up by Marius Nacht, co-founder and chairman of cybersecurity provider Check Point Software Technologies, and Amnon Shashua, whose self-driving car technology firm Mobileye was acquired by Intel for $15 billion. Central bank Governor Amir Yaron and banking regulator Hedva Ber said they had notified the two entrepreneurs that they have examined their plans and are prepared to issue a banking license. Israel's banking sector is dominated by two large banks, Hapoalim and Leumi, with around 55% of the market. Four smaller banks also operate. Leumi has it own online banking unit called Pepper. Ber said the regulators, who have been in touch with Nacht and Shashua for more than a year, expect the new bank will boost competition. “This is an important day,” Ber told reporters by phone. “We think they can make a breakthrough in banking.” Competitive pressures are expected to prompt Israel's banks to reduce fees even before the bank begins operations, which is expected in about a year and a half, Ber said. The digital bank should have lower operating costs than the existing banks as it will not have branches and will focus on retail services including extending credit to households and accepting deposits. A source close to Nacht and Shashua said that together they will invest $60 million in the bank and expect to bring in more investors who will inject at least another $60 million. Former accountant-general Shuki Oren will chair the bank. Ber said the central bank has taken measures to ease the process of establishing a new bank, including reducing the requirement for starting capital to 50 million shekels ($14 million) from 400 million. Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon on Tuesday urged the central bank to accelerate the process of issuing new licenses, adding that a number of groups are awaiting approval, but gave no details.

China's central bank says in no rush to ease aggressively,Sep 24 2019,"BEIJING () - China is in no rush to follow other countries in significantly loosening monetary policy but has ample options to help prop up slowing growth, its central bank head said on Tuesday, maintaining a cautious approach to stimulating the economy. Despite a slew of growth measures since last year, the world's second-largest economy has yet to stabilize as the Sino-U.S. trade war shows no sign of ending. Analysts expect growth could cool further this quarter from a near 30-year low of 6.2% hit in April-June. People's Bank of China (PBOC) governor Yi Gang said macro-economic policies have significant room to move.  “But we are in no hurry to take measures similar to central banks of other countries, such as relatively big interest rate cuts or quantitative easing polices,” Yi said in a briefing ahead of the country's 70th anniversary. China cut its new one-year benchmark lending rate for the second month in a row on Friday, as the central bank seeks to lower borrowing costs to support smaller firms affected by the trade war and wider slowdown. But the 5 basis point move was far smaller than the U.S. Federal Reserve's 25 basis point easing of its benchmark overnight lending rate last week.  Yi said there was still plenty of room to maneuver on monetary policy, though such options should be used carefully. He also said that authorities would maintain “normal” monetary policy for as long as possible.  “China's monetary policy will maintain its prudent orientation,” he said, reiterating Beijing's pledge not to resort to “flood-like” stimulus. “I believe that, in the process of monetary policy operations, we should cherish the normal monetary policy room so that we can extend the normal monetary policy as long as possible, which will be favorable for sustainable economic development and people's livelihood.” China, while trying to keep its debt levels steady, should step up reforms and improve the monetary policy transmission mechanism to help lower financing costs, Yi said.   Some policy insiders have said the room for the government to step up stimulus measures could be limited by its worries about rising debt risks and possible property bubbles. Beijing has leaned more heavily on fiscal stimulus to address the current downturn, announcing trillions of yuan in tax cuts and special local government bonds to finance infrastructure projects. Ning Jizhe, vice head of the National Development and Reform Commission, told reporters at the same briefing that China would step up efforts to stabilize growth, including speeding up project construction and relaxed restrictions on auto purchases. Ning said cities including Xian, Kunming, Guiyang are considering abolishing or easing restrictions on auto purchases, following recent steps in Guangzhou and Shenzhen.  Local governments will be allowed to issue special bonds earlier than usual in 2020, focusing on areas including transportation, energy, environmental protection, logistics and urban infrastructure, Ning said.  Finance Minister Liu Kun said during the same briefing that local governments are on track to complete bond issuance within the annual quota by the end of September, and allocate proceeds to investment projects by the end of October. Beijing has set a quota of 2.15 trillion yuan ($302.50 billion) for local governments to sell special bonds this year to fund infrastructure, including road, rail and water projects.

Breakingviews - Hong Kong's IPO debutants rely on helping hands,Sep 24 2019,"HONG KONG ( Breakingviews) - Hong Kong's latest wave of listings are attracting some big helping hands. Anheuser-Busch InBev raised $5 billion through a relaunched float of its Asia-Pacific unit. There's appetite for new share issues in the city despite ongoing protests, but at a discount and with strong cornerstone support.  After its attempt to sell shares in Budweiser Brewing Company APAC fell flat in July, AB InBev sold the unit's low-growth Australian division to Japan's Asahi, then relaunched the process last week with backing from Singapore state investment fund GIC. Priced at the bottom end of a marketed range, the new deal gives Budweiser APAC an enterprise value of $45 billion. When adding in the generous $11 billion raised from Asahi, that's within the roughly $53 billion to $62 billion range the company had initially sought. A listing by Chinese biotech company Henlius, which raised $410 million last week in the city's first major IPO since July, looked similar. Support from four cornerstone backers including the Qatar Investment Authority got it across the line, but it too priced at the lower end. The return of such giant backers may raise some eyebrows. A staple of the Hong Kong market in tough times, cornerstones played a critical role following the Asian financial crisis of 1997, when tycoons and sovereign wealth funds were key to getting deals done. Selling a big slug of stock ahead of an IPO reduces risk for issuers and underwriters, and restrictions on share sales by cornerstone buyers can ease volatility.  On the other hand, such arrangements can stifle secondary-market liquidity, and foist unfit companies onto public markets. Menswear maker China Outfitters tried and failed to launch an IPO in 2011, only to succeed later by selling three quarters of a new offering to cornerstone backers including KKR. Shares bounced at first, but within a few months began a ceaseless slide; they now trade at 9% of the offering price.  Companies queuing up to raise capital in the Fragrant Harbour, including warehouse operator ESR and consumer-finance company Home Credit, may need to take a similar tack in these tough times.

"Swiss probe incident involving ex-Credit Suisse banker Khan, private detectives",Sep 23 2019," (This September 23 story corrects paragraph 13 to clarify the incident occurred last week, not last month.) ZURICH () - Prosecutors have opened a criminal probe into an incident in which Credit Suisse () allegedly hired private detectives to shadow the Swiss bank's ex-wealth management head, Iqbal Khan, the Zurich attorney's office said on Monday. Khan, a rising star in Swiss finance, is moving to rival bank UBS () to head its wealth management unit in October, just three months after leaving Credit Suisse.  Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung, without citing its sources, reported on Sunday that Credit Suisse had hired three detectives to investigate whether Khan was seeking to lure its employees to UBS.  The Zurich attorney's office said Khan filed a criminal complaint last week alleging threats and coercion in a Sept. 17 confrontation, but did not say who made the threats or what they were. “As a result of a criminal complaint (by Khan)...the Zurich District Attorney has opened a criminal investigation into coercion/threat,” a prosecutors office spokesman said in an email. Khan, via a spokesman, denied trying to poach Credit Suisse workers for his new employer. “Suspicions that he was trying to hire people away from Credit Suisse are absurd,” the spokesman said. SonntagsZeitung said one of the men allegedly following Khan sought to take Khan's phone after he tried to take a photograph of the detectives' car.     Credit Suisse Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam and Chairman Urs Rohner said a detailed inquiry was under way, but sought to play down the media reports. “There are significant inaccuracies in the reporting that have sensationalized both facts and events,” the two leaders wrote in the memo seen by .  “Please rest assured that a detailed inquiry has been launched by the Board of Directors into these events and we are confident that the truth will emerge.”  Khan, the son of Pakistani immigrants who came to Switzerland when he was 12, is seen in Swiss banking circles as a potential future CEO of a big Swiss bank, such as UBS.  Swiss media, including financial industry website Inside Paradeplatz, reported that the incident last week began when Khan, 43, and his wife were tailed by another vehicle carrying three men to near the Swiss National Bank building in the heart of Zurich's financial district. Khan stepped from his car and attempted to photograph the other vehicle with his cell phone. SonntagsZeitung reported that the occupants of the other vehicle fled after passers-by noticed the altercation, adding the three men were eventually detained for questioning. Financial institutions including in Switzerland are covetous of client-employee relationships, and sometimes place employees or ex-employees under intense scrutiny to ensure they do not violate non-compete clauses or other contractual obligations. “Mostly, such practices never meet the light of day,” Swiss reputation consultant Bernhard Bauhofer told Swiss tabloid Blick.   Khan announced his resignation from Credit Suisse in July “to pursue other opportunities”. UBS said last month that it had appointed Khan to co-head its flagship wealth management business starting on Oct. 1 as part of a broader shake-up of its executive board. UBS and Swiss financial supervisor FINMA declined to comment.  ","{'neg': 0.062, 'neu': 0.846, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': 0.9432}",0.9432

"GRAPHIC-'Quitaly'? - How 'last year', say markets",Sep 24 2019,"(Repeats item that ran on Monday, no changes to text) By Dhara Ranasinghe and Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Sept 23 () - The risk of the euro zone breaking up, which preyed on investors' minds in 2018, has fallen to the lowest level in over a year, market gauges show, as Italy's new government allays fears of “Quitaly”, the possibility of Rome exiting the single currency bloc. Italian bond yields have slid to record lows below 1%, galvanised by the formation of a new coalition government comprising the 5-Star Movement and the pro-European Democratic Party. With the League - a party with a strong eurosceptic element - now out of government, the risk of Italy leaving the euro zone has tumbled. “All that matters ultimately for Italian government bonds is whether Italy leaves the euro (or the euro zone breaks up),” said Mike Riddell, head of UK fixed income at Allianz Global Investors. “The Italian government is arguably now the most market friendly in its history, and we therefore see a negligible risk of Italy wanting to leave the euro (or a euro zone breakup) over the next 12 months.” Euro break-up risk has been a key driver of Italian bonds in recent years, and the easing of such risks boosts the appeal of one of the few positive-yielding debt markets in the bloc. Indicators closely tracked by analysts support this view: 1/ Take the performance of Italian bonds denominated in dollars versus those issued in euros. The yield on a 15-year euro-denominated Italian bond, or BTP, hit a record low in early September, while the yield on a similar maturity bond denominated in dollars is near seven-week highs. Investors believe dollar bonds, governed by New York law, would offer stronger protection against debt restructuring, including currency redenomination, than the euro issues governed by Italian law. So, whenever concern over Italy arises, dollar-denominated BTPs outperform their euro peers. That happened after the 2016 Brexit vote in Britain, in 2017 when anti-euro far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen surged in opinion polls ahead of elections, and last year when Italy's government quarrelled with the EU over spending policy. While the dollar bonds' recent underperformance is down partly to speculation of a new dollar issue, investors said the removal of “Quitaly” risks was crucial, especially as other indicators too suggest a reduced risk of Italy exiting the euro. For most of last year, Italian bonds linked to local inflation performed better than those linked to euro zone inflation - the view was a return to the lira would result in significant currency devaluation, and subsequently, higher inflation. These fears accelerated after the League proposed issuing short-term bills known as mini-BOTs to settle state arrears. These could become a parallel currency and represent a de facto step towards leaving the euro, markets believed. But with the League no longer in power, the yield on an Italian bond maturing in 2023 and linked to euro zone inflation, has fallen almost 90 bps since early August. A similar maturity bond linked to local inflation has seen yields slip 71 bps. “The key really is the fact that (Matteo) Salvini and the League are not involved and this has been a turning point for Italian politics,” said Mohammed Kazmi, a portfolio manager at UBP. “It has meant that investors have become more relaxed somewhat on fearing market unfriendly headlines whether that's something negative on the euro or something very expansionary on fiscal policy.” Italy's new finance minister, Roberto Gualtieri, has signaled that he wants to avoid a clash with the EU. Kazmi said the sharp fall in insurance that investors take out against a sovereign default and a tightening in the Italian/German bond yield gap perhaps offer the best evidence that investors are more relaxed about “Quitaly” and a euro breakup. Italy's 10-year bond yield premia over Germany has tumbled almost 200 basis points from highs above 300 bps reached late last year. Five-year credit default swaps earlier this month fell to their lowest since just before the May 2018 bond rout All that, alongside new ECB asset purchase plans and sliding debt-servicing costs, are easing concerns about Italy's credit rating outlook. Michele Napolitano, head of the western European sovereign ratings team at Fitch, said more detail on  fiscal policy was needed before any improvement in the BBB rating - two notches above junk. But he told a conference last week: “Any EU exit is off the table.” ","{'neg': 0.075, 'neu': 0.857, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': -0.24}",-0.24

He then got back inside the vehicle, which sped out of the parking lot.  Associated Press photographer Dieu-Nalio Chery was injured in the jaw and would undergo treatment to remove what appeared to be a bullet fragment, the news agency said in a report, adding he was expected to recover. International media outlets reported a security guard was also injured, but there were no details on his condition. When asked about the incident, Fethiere told Radio Mega he had acted in self defense.  A dispute between Haiti and a U.S. energy trading firm has caused power blackouts and fuel shortages in the nation of 11 million people, feeding anger at President Jovenel Moise's government.  The Western Hemisphere's poorest nation, Haiti long relied on fuel shipments from nearby OPEC member Venezuela, which offered cheap financing to several Caribbean nations to buy its gasoline, diesel and other products through a program called Petrocaribe. But the scheme fell apart last year due to economic turmoil in Venezuela, forcing Haiti to return to international markets and causing prices to rise.

European business group warns of China economic stagnation if SOEs not reined in,Sep 24 2019,"BEIJING () - A top European business lobby said on Tuesday that China must fulfill promises to give greater sway to market forces and rein in its bloated state sector, warning that not doing so will lead to economic stagnation and stoke continuing tensions with trade partners. China's economic growth slowed to a near 30-year low of 6.2% in the second quarter, partly on pressures brought about by a trade war with the United States.  “With a possible crisis looming on the horizon it's now the time to walk the talk,” European Union Chamber of Commerce in China President Joerg Wuttke told reporters ahead of the launch of the chamber's annual position paper. He called on Beijing to embrace the principle of “competitive neutrality” and treat all companies equally regardless of ownership. The paper said the debts and assets of China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which enjoy monopolies in some industries, easy access to financing, and favored procurement bids, are ballooning. This represents a “gross misallocation of resources” away from more productive privately owned companies, it said.  Chinese banks have long tended to favor lending to the state sector as repayment is seen as guaranteed. Many of China's smaller, private companies have struggled to access credit amid a crackdown on the shadow banking system, which they had relied on instead. Some SOEs also put more pressure on their private suppliers by delaying payment for lengthy periods of time, effectively turning such firms into “little banks” said Wuttke.  The paper said China has gone back on a 2013 promise to let the market play a “decisive” role in allocating resources. It warned that this will make it harder for the country to escape the so-called “middle income trap”, where economies stagnate without incomes reaching the levels of advanced nations. Chinese President Xi Jinping called for SOEs to become “stronger, better, and bigger” at the 19th Communist Party Congress in 2017. Beijing's  support for its SOEs also leads to suspicion abroad and is driving current U.S.-China tensions, said the paper. U.S. demands that China curb the development of its SOEs were described as an “invasion” on its economic sovereignty by Chinese state news agency Xinhua in May. The paper urged the European Union to pressure China to reform its state sector by strengthening screening against Chinese overseas investment and investigating barriers to European firms in China's public procurement market.  Deputy trade negotiators from the U.S. and China wrapped up talks on Friday that aimed to pave the way for another round of high-level meetings in early October, as the world's two largest economies attempt to bring their lengthy trade war to an end. China had little incentive to seriously reform its SOEs while it enjoyed double-digit GDP growth, but the slowing economy and trade war should be a wake up call, bringing years of “complacency and hubris” to an end, said Wuttke.

UPDATE 2-Chile's Codelco issues $2 bln in bonds amid mine overhaul plan,Sep 24 2019,"(Adds details on Codelco buyback plan) By Aislinn Laing and Natalia A. Ramos Miranda SANTIAGO, Sept 23 () - Chile's state copper miner Codelco issued $2 billion worth of bonds on Monday, while offering to buy back short-term notes, as it seeks to smooth financing of a major overhaul of its aging mines. The 10 and 30-year dollar-denominated bonds were issued in New York with yields of 3.02% and 3.71%, respectively, the company said in a statement. It said it had simultaneously offered to buy back $639 million in bonds that come due in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023, with the goal of lightening its short-term debt load. The move comes as Codelco seeks financing for a sprawling 10-year, $40 billion overhaul of its mines, the largest of which have been dogged by declining ore grades and increasing costs at a time when the copper price has plummeted. Last month, Codelco sold $180 million worth of bonds and offloaded a minority stake in natural gas port terminal GNL Mejillones for $193.5 million. The miner, which produces nearly 10% of the world's copper, returns all its profits to the state and is funded by a mix of capitalization and debt. In April, Chairman Juan Benavides told  Codelco was sufficiently capitalized after issuing $1.3 billion in 30-year bonds in January to be able to fund its mine overhaul plan. However, Chile's economy has been hit by a fall in the copper price that makes up as much as 15% of its gross domestic product, and Codelco's operations have been further hampered by labor strife and poor weather. The firm saw profits plunge 74% to $318 million in the first half of 2019. ","{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.911, 'pos': 0.05, 'compound': 0.3182}",0.3182
Manhattan prosecutor urges judge to reject Trump lawsuit over tax returns,Sep 24 2019,"NEW YORK () - A Manhattan state prosecutor on Monday urged a federal judge to dismiss U.S. President Donald Trump's bid to block a subpoena seeking eight years of his tax returns as part of a criminal investigation. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance argued in a court filing that Trump must not be allowed to assert “blanket immunity from criminal prosecution,” including for conduct before he took office. Vance also argued that the dispute belongs in New York state court, where a grand jury issued the subpoena, not in federal court. U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in Manhattan is scheduled to hear arguments in the case on Wednesday. Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for Trump, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Trump filed the lawsuit on Thursday seeking to block enforcement of grand jury subpoena that Vance issued on Aug. 29 to Mazars USA, Trump's longtime accounting firm, for personal and corporate tax returns from 2011 to 2018. Mazars is also named as a defendant in Trump's lawsuit. The firm said in a statement it “will respect the legal process and fully comply with its legal obligations,” though as a matter of policy it does not comment on its work for clients. Vance issued the subpoena four weeks after issuing another subpoena to the Trump Organization for records of hush money payments, including to two women prior to the 2016 election. The women, porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, have said they had sexual relationships with Trump, which he has denied. Michael Cohen, the president's former lawyer, has admitted to paying $130,000 to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, to keep her from talking about her alleged relationship with Trump in 2016. He also admitted to helping arrange a payment of $150,000 to McDougal. Cohen is serving a three-year prison term for campaign finance violations, including through the hush money payments, as well as tax evasion and lying to Congress.

UK Labour party pledge billions to support electric vehicle industry,Sep 24 2019,"BRIGHTON, England () - Britain's opposition Labour Party will lay out on Tuesday a multi-billion pound package to boost development of electric cars and battery technology, promising to create tens of thousands of jobs and safeguard the automotive industry. Labour is hoping to win power from Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party at an expected early election, capitalizing on the political unrest caused by the country's divisive exit from the European Union. The socialist-led Labour Party is using its annual conference in the English resort of Brighton to lay out plans to transform the British economy, promoting higher government spending and a large public investment program. On Tuesday, the party will pledge to invest 3 billion pounds ($3.73 billion) with car manufacturers in return for a stake in their companies if they use the money to develop new electric car models and technology.  It will also promise more than 2 billion pounds to help finance half the cost of building three new battery factories - a leading part of the growing electric vehicle industry. “The automotive sector is one of the UK's industrial success stories. However, the sector is under siege from Brexit uncertainty and the government's lack of ambition on electrification,” Labour's business policy chief Rebecca Long-Bailey said in a statement. “If we want our automotive sector to flourish, we need a government who is not afraid to intervene.” Britain's car industry has suffered a mixed year, with Ford and Honda announcing factory closures, but others like Ineos and Jaguar Land Rover making fresh investments. Brexit, and specifically fears that Britain will end up leaving the EU without an exit deal to mitigate the economic disruption, has been cited as a major worry for manufacturers who rely on intricate cross-border supply chains. Labour said 3 billion pounds would be available in 2020/21 and 2021/2022. Firms would be invited to bid for a portion of the cash and would have to match the amount they receive. The investment takes the form of equity finance; capital in exchange for shares in the company.  Although Labour trail the ruling Conservatives in opinion polls, the outcome of any election is highly uncertain and will likely hinge on how the country resolves its three-year crisis over Brexit in the coming months. Although Labour presents itself as a government-in-waiting, it has also suffered damaging splits over Brexit and leader Jeremy Corbyn has yet to convince some voters of his ability to take control of the world's fifth largest economy. An important component of any election campaign would be long-term plans for the country's economy, with polls showing increased voter appetite for higher public spending after nearly a decade of deficit-reducing cutbacks. Labour said their investment plan would create 32,000 new jobs and help protect another 186,000 car industry workers. The bulk of those new jobs would come from the battery factories, often known as gigafactories, and the associated chemical supply and processing chains. They said each factory would cost 1.5-1.7 billion pounds.  Labour said they would look to retain a 51% publicly managed stake in the factories, and build them in South Wales, Stoke and Swindon - regions which have all suffered from industrial decline.

UK's Labour targets large offshore wind farm expansion,Sep 24 2019,"BRIGHTON, England, Sept 23 () - Britain's opposition Labour Party will build 37 new offshore wind farms with a 51% publicly-owned stake if it wins power, business spokeswoman Rebecca Long-Bailey will say on Tuesday, outlining a large expansion of renewable energy generation. Labour is laying out swathes of new policy at its annual party conference in Brighton, eyeing an expected early election triggered by the Conservative-led government's crisis over leaving the European Union. Promoting climate-friendly policies, increased public ownership of utilities and better provision of free services, the socialist-led party wants to reshape the world fifth-largest economy, saying it will create jobs and protect workers, and the environment. “While UK's offshore wind industry is still young, the UK has the opportunity to avoid replicating Britain's experience with North Sea Oil and instead to learn from countries such as Norway and Sweden by owning what is already ours,” Long-Bailey said in a statement. It would cost 83 billion pounds, invested between 2020 and 2030, with 58 billion coming from “limited-recourse project finance from the private sector”. Taking existing wind generation into account, the plan would seek to generate 52 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030 - equivalent to 38 coal power stations. Labour said the new wind farms would be enough to provide electricity for 57 million households. ","{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.837, 'pos': 0.136, 'compound': 0.9716}",0.9716
Young climate activists accuse world leaders of violating child rights through inaction,Sep 24 2019,"NEW YORK () - Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg and 15 other young climate activists on Monday filed a complaint with the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child alleging that world leaders' inaction on the climate crisis has violated children's rights. The petitioners, who range in age from 8 to 17 and hail from 12 different countries, teared up as they presented their complaint at the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) headquarters and gave personal accounts of how their lives and homes have been upended by climate change because of politicians' inaction. “World leaders have failed to keep what they promised. They promised to protect our rights and they have not done that,” said Thunberg, who spoke after giving an impassioned address to the U.N. General Assembly earlier on Monday. The complaint is the latest action by young people to highlight the growing threat of climate change and the risks of ignoring it. On Friday, some 4 million people participated in a global climate strike, inspired by Thunberg, the 16-year-old who started a weekly school strike in August 2018 to raise awareness about the issue. The complaint accuses the respondent countries - Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey - of knowing about the impact of their carbon emissions on the climate and doing nothing to mitigate it.  The respondents are a few of the biggest carbon emitters out of the 45 countries that have signed a protocol allowing children to seek redress under the 1989 Convention of the Rights of the Child, a treaty that declared the unassailable civil, economic, social, political and cultural rights of children. Other major carbon emitters like the United States and China have not signed the protocol.  “We will not permit them to take our future away. They had the right to have their future; why don't we have the right to have our own?” said Catarina Lorenzo, 12, of Salvador, Brazil.  Global warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels has already led to droughts and heat waves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and floods, and scientists say the crisis has intensified since world leaders signed the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat climate change. Three of the child petitioners from the Marshall Islands urged world leaders to visit their country to see firsthand how the rising seas are swallowing the central Pacific islands.  “I would show you my backyard,” said Litokne Kabua, 16, who said the ocean has crept up on his family's property in recent years.  “I would show you my old house that was destroyed by a storm in the summer of 2015,” said Ranton Anjain, 17, adding that the seawalls Marshallese people have built have proven useless. Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine on Monday said she would seek parliamentary approval to declare a climate crisis on the low-lying atoll.  Heine said her country and New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and others, which form the “High Ambition” bloc at U.N. climate negotiations, will commit to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. More than 60 world leaders and chief executives of energy and financial companies are expected to address the General Assembly this week and announce climate finance measures and transitioning from coal power.

"Colombia's central bank holds interest rate, raises growth estimate",Sep 24 2019,"BOGOTA () - Colombia's central bank board unanimously held its benchmark interest rate steady at 4.25% at its meeting on Monday and raised its economic growth prediction for the year, taking it closer to the government's target. The decision to hold the rate yet again met the predictions of all analysts in a  survey last week. The analysts expect the board to hold the rate until next year. The six policymakers present raised 2019 expansion expectations to 3.2% from 3%, moving their figure nearer to the government target of 3.6%. “The economy is rebounding, it is rebounding better than what people think,” said Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla, who represents the government on the board. Analysts predict growth will reach 3.15% this year. The board looks likely to meet analysts' expectation of rate holds through the end of 2019. “My best prediction with the current information is that what could happen is for the rate we have today to be held a few months more,” board chief Juan Jose Echavarria said. The decision to keep borrowing costs steady was based on inflation falling toward the bank's long-term 3% goal, the board said in a statement. “Basic inflation measures continue around 3%. It is expected that at the end of 2019 these supply shocks will begin to dilute, and inflation will resume its convergence to the target, as reflected in market expectations,” it said. Inflation expectations in the poll were down slightly for the close of 2019 to 3.63%, from 3.66% in last month's survey, as food prices moderated. Monday's meeting included only six of the board's normal seven members because new member Roberto Steiner has not yet taken up his post.

Israel's Cellcom to cut jobs as competition heats up,Sep 24 2019,"() - Cellcom Israel Ltd said on Monday it would cut jobs and payments to suppliers as part of a restructuring plan aimed at returning to profits by the end of 2020.  Israel's largest mobile phone operator said the steps would strengthen the company as it faces continued competition and low prices in the Israeli telecommunications market.  The company did not specify how many jobs it would cut, but said at this point it would not include sale and service customer facing staff. Israel's mobile phone industry was shaken up in 2012 with the entry of a host of new operators, sparking a price war that led to steep drops in subscribers, revenue and profit for Cellcom and rivals Partner Communications and Pelephone, a unit of Bezeq. Last month, the company reported a steeper-than-expected quarterly loss, weighed down by a jump in financing costs and fierce competition. The company aims to cut its capital expenditure to 450 million–500 million shekels ($142.35 million) a year, it said. Execution of its plan may entail significant one-time expenses, Cellcom said. The company's U.S.-listed shares fell 2.8% to $2.05. ","{'neg': 0.088, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.064, 'compound': -0.5574}",-0.5574
Breakingviews - Green finance can fix its Groucho Marx problem,Sep 24 2019,"LONDON ( Breakingviews) - When it comes to clientele, every club confronts a Groucho Marx problem. The comedian famously quipped that he avoided establishments that would have him as a member. Green-finance pledges have had to wrestle with a similar dilemma in deciding whether to prioritise quantity of supporters, or quality. Principles for Responsible Investment, launched in 2006 with the support of the United Nations, proudly states that it has signatories who control $86 trillion of assets. Yet many attendees at its own conference in Paris earlier this month see the claim as slightly embarrassing. If all that investment was being deployed in line with environmental, social and governance principles – as PRI membership implies – climate change would be under control. Instead, only 2% of participants reach the PRI's preferred level of green disclosure and scenario-planning. This should give pause for thought as the United Nation's Climate Action Summit kicks off in New York this week with two new PRI-style pledges. It's great that 12 significant asset owners like CalPERS and Allianz are pledging to make their activities carbon neutral by 2050.  It's also good that 130 banks including Santander  and Citigroup  are signing up for the newly launched Principles for Responsible Banking, to align lending with the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement and limit global warming. But that represents only a third of the global banking system – big names like JPMorgan, Bank of America  and HSBC  aren't yet on board. One refusenik told Breakingviews it wasn't joining because executives feel pledge inflation has devalued the currency of participation. The solution is twofold. First, echoing the PRI's threat to eject 50 laggard signatories, boot out unworthy members. Second, establish a VIP area that is sufficiently alluring.  Here Natixis  may have supplied the missing piece of the puzzle. The French investment bank said on Monday it would voluntarily divide 127 billion euros of loans into seven different buckets based on their green credentials, with the risk weighting of the best assets cut in half while the worst rise by a quarter. By publicly and proactively tinkering with capital requirements for each type of loan, the 12 billion euro group is providing its own incentives instead of waiting for regulators to step in. If Natixis-style transparency were to be made mandatory for fellow lenders that signed the Principles for Responsible Banking, green finance's VIP area could become enticingly busy.

Turkey remains susceptible to external and domestic risks - IMF,Sep 24 2019,"LONDON/ANKARA () - Turkey remains susceptible to external and domestic risks, the International Monetary Fund said on Monday, while strong, sustainable growth would be challenging without further reforms by the government. “The current calm (in Turkish financial markets) appears fragile. Reserves remain low, and private sector FX debt and external financing needs high,” the IMF said in a statement after an ‘Article IV' visit to Turkey by its staff. The main policy challenge is to move from a short-run growth focus to securing stronger and more resilient growth over the medium term. Turkey's economy has grown by an average of more than 5% annually over the last 15 year but inflation and interest rates soared after the lira lost 30% of its value last year and domestic demand fell sharply, tipping the economy into recession. Turkey's economy contracted 1.5% in the second quarter, the third straight quarterly year-on-year contraction, but leading economic indications have shown signs of recovery with reduced lira volatility and slowing inflation.  The IMF said further steps to clean up bank and corporate balance sheets would support financial stability and stronger and more resilient growth over the medium term. Turkey's banking watchdog told banks to write off 46 billion lira of loans by the end of the year and set aside loss reserves, in a move aimed mostly at the hard-hit energy and construction sectors. The IMF also said efforts to expand lending should be limited while ensuring credit is provided to viable borrowers. It added that Turkey should revisit recent changes to reserve requirements made to incentivise private bank lending. In a separate statement, IMF said it met with representatives from the private sector, political parties and think tanks to obtain a broader view of economic developments in Turkey. The Turkish finance ministry criticized the IMF delegation's meetings, which it said took place without notice, and said it found it inappropriate for IMF to conduct other meetings in Turkey without knowledge of the ministry.

"Eyes on U.S. prize, Primark considers Central American suppliers",Sep 22 2019,"LONDON () - Confident it can crack the $300 billion U.S. clothing and shoes market where many other foreign retailers have failed, Britain's Primark is ready to raise its bet on the country by securing new sources of fast fashion in central America. Primark, whose trendy clothes at rock-bottom prices have taken UK shoppers by storm, opened in Boston in 2015 and now has nine stores in the northeast, all served by a warehouse in  Pennsylvania that could still serve three times as many stores. It has invested 250 million pounds ($313 million) in the United States, achieved a critical mass of sales and has a four-year education under its belt on a crowded market that is battling to stay afloat in the face of rapid e-commerce growth. Now its owner, London-listed conglomerate Associated British Foods (), is convinced Primark's disciplined store-by-store approach can succeed in a country that has been a graveyard for some of Britain's biggest retailers, including Marks & Spencer, Tesco and most recently Philip Green's Topshop. “I believe that the U.S. will be a winner for Primark,” John Bason, AB Foods' finance director, told . That confidence is underlined by a move to create a supply chain closer to the U.S. market. Primark currently sources all its clothes for the United States from its traditional supplier countries of China, India, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Vietnam and Turkey - a costly exercise as stock is freighted across the Pacific, through the Panama Canal and up the U.S eastern seaboard. The plan now is to tap suppliers from countries in central America, such as Guatemala, Costa Rica and Mexico. “We're getting to that point now, with the sales level that we've got in the U.S. already,” said Bason, a 20-year veteran of AB Foods. “Certainly countries in central America I think would really start to come through.” Founded by the late Arthur Ryan in Dublin in 1969, Primark trades from 373 stores in 12 countries, turning over 7.5 billion pounds and making 843 million pounds of profit in its 2017-18 financial year, a near fourfold increase in ten years - all achieved without venturing into online shopping. Primark, Britain's biggest fashion retailer by number of items sold, has made its mark on price, selling T-shirts and swimsuits for as a little as five pounds - its customers often laden with its trademark brown paper bags. Those economics make an online offer untenable. Primark contributes more than half of the total profit of its parent, which also owns major sugar and grocery arms and has a stock market value of 18 billion pounds. Some analysts believe Primark's combination of value, fashionability and breadth of range, means it could build a U.S. business over the next decade as big as its one in Europe. That would threaten value fashion retailers like Old Navy, American Eagle and Target on their own turf, and pitch it against Sweden's H&M, which trades from 578 stores in the United States, and Spain's Inditex, which has 102. Primark's tenth U.S. store will open at American Dream, New Jersey, this autumn, followed by one in Florida in 2020, its first outside the northeast corridor. Contracts have also been exchanged on a store in Chicago. Stores in highly populated cities on the eastern seaboard at locations with high footfall will follow. Bason said a decision to downsize three Primark stores - Freehold Raceway in New Jersey, Danbury Fair in Connecticut and King of Prussia in Pennsylvania - was critical to fine tuning its U.S. model. Sales levels were maintained from smaller footprints - sales densities went up, while operating costs went down, which meant profitability improved. Conversely the profitability of the Boston store was raised by increasing its size. “If you talk about learnings, that really was the key, it's the big one,” said Bason. “You add more stores and each one a profitable store, then the overall profitability will increase ... now you are in a virtuous circle.” AB Foods said this month that Primark was delivering strong sales growth in the United States and forecast a significantly reduced operating loss for 2018-19, which reflects the deliberate under utilisation of its warehouse. “At some point ... you would then put a second warehouse somewhere else, strategically placed, and start to add stores from that location,” said Bason, noting any move into California would necessitate a warehouse west of the Rocky Mountains. “The thing that goes to the heart of Primark is learn about the individual market - it was always Arthur's mantra.” ","{'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.865, 'pos': 0.112, 'compound': 0.996}",0.996
UPDATE 1-Britain's opposition Labour plans to abolish private schools,Sep 24 2019,"(Adds PM Johnson response) BRIGHTON, England, Sept 23 () - Britain's main opposition Labour Party has agreed to abolish private schools, a move for which finance policy chief John McDonnell said on Monday the party would begin drawing up proposals. At its annual conference in the English seaside resort of Brighton, the Labour Party passed a motion supported by leftist groups to abolish private schools and integrate them into the state sector to help dismantle “the privilege of a tiny”. Labour is introducing new policies at its conference, hoping to present itself as a government in waiting to replace Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who went to the elite Eton school, at an election widely expected to come before the end of the year. About seven percent of British pupils are educated at private schools, but critics say they dominate places at top universities and are far overly-represented in senior roles in politics, law, media and business. Two-thirds of Johnson's cabinet of senior ministers attended private school and David Cameron, who was prime minister from 2010-2016, also went to Eton. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn spent some years of his education at a private school, and several members of his team of senior lawmakers sent their children to fee-paying schools. “Now the discussions will take place exactly how that will work. You can see this developing over time,” finance policy chief John McDonnell told Sky News. “What we're saying is ‘let's have one education service for everybody. Let's end these grotesque levels of inequality within our educational system'.” Johnson, who said he owed a lot to his education, described the move was “pointless attack on the education system” at a time when the government was seeking to boost education funding. “This would cost 7 billion pounds ($8.7 billion) of taxpayers money to educate at public expense all the pupils, all the children who would no longer be educated privately,” he told reporters on the plane to the UN General Assembly in New York. “It seems unbelievable to me that the Labour Party should now be setting out to abolish a load of schools.” ","{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.897, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': 0.85}",0.85
Russia to fund modernization of army in breakaway Georgian region: Putin,Sep 23 2019,"MOSCOW () - Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved a government proposal to bankroll the modernization of the armed forces in the breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia, a government document published online showed on Monday. Georgia lost control of the Black Sea region of Abkhazia after an inter-ethnic conflict which followed the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Russia is one of only a handful of countries to recognize Abkhazia's independence, something it decided to do in 2008 after it won a short war against Georgia over the fate of another Georgian breakaway region.    Russia, which has its own troops on the ground, will sign an agreement to finance the modernization of Abkhazia's armed forces after detailed negotiations are over, the government document said. Georgia condemned the move and called the agreement between Russia and Abkhazia illegal. “This is another illegal step by the Russian Federation to integrate the Georgian regions into the Russian political and military space, which is a continuation of Russia's annexed policy,” said Vladimer Konstantinidi, Georgia's foreign ministry spokesman. Georgia, which aspires to join the European Union and NATO, has not had diplomatic relations with Russia since 2008. It wants to get back control of Abkhazia and another breakaway region, South Ossetia, and for Russian troops to leave. ","{'neg': 0.1, 'neu': 0.834, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': -0.7845}",-0.7845
Incoming ECB President Lagarde: Trade tensions biggest threat to global economy,Sep 23 2019,"WASHINGTON () - Threats to trade are the biggest hurdle for the global economy, but the U.S. economy, the world's largest, remains in a good place, Christine Lagarde, incoming president of the European Central Bank, told CNBC in an interview broadcast on Monday. Lagarde, who headed the International Monetary Fund since 2011, told CNBC that tariffs imposed by the United States and China were expected to shave 0.8% off global economic growth in 2020, weighing like a “big, dark cloud on the global economy.” At the same time, Lagarde said in an interview taped on Friday that the U.S. economy was “in a very good place.” The European Parliament last week backed Lagarde as the next president of the European Central Bank, the first woman in the post. Lawmakers voted 394 in favor, 206 against and with 49 abstentions on Sept. 17. EU leaders selected the former antitrust lawyer in July to replace Mario Draghi from Nov. 1 at the helm of the bloc's most powerful financial institution. EU leaders will formalize her appointment in mid October for an eight-year term. Lagarde expressed optimism about Europe's economic prospects given what she called massive changes since 2011 in terms of increased supervision of financial institutions, better capitalization and lower financing costs. But she noted policymakers now had less space to make fiscal and monetary adjustments, adding economic risks would come from “somewhere where we don't anticipate them.” Lagarde said Europe would be in “good shape” if the euro area moved to create a real banking union and strengthen capital market, and there were indications this was in process. “If the euro area can strengthen, and there are indications that this could be on the short term horizon, with a real banking union, with a better capital market which has euro area dimensions and good depth, and if there is more of a joint effort to steer the economy of Europe, I think that region of the world will be in good shape,” she said. Addressing complaints about the slow the pace of change in the euro zone, she said decisions take longer there because policy must be coordinated among 19 countries.  “My hope is that it's not just about monetary (policy), it's also about fiscal, it's also about structural reforms, in order to unleash the potential, in order to help enterprise, in order to help households to develop, to hire, to invest,” she said.

"Graphic: 'Quitaly'? - How 'last year', say markets",Sep 23 2019,"LONDON () - The risk of the euro zone breaking up, which preyed on investors' minds in 2018, has fallen to the lowest level in over a year, market gauges show, as Italy's new government allays fears of “Quitaly”, the possibility of Rome exiting the single currency bloc. Italian bond yields have slid to record lows below 1%, galvanized by the formation of a new coalition government comprising the 5-Star Movement and the pro-European Democratic Party. With the League - a party with a strong eurosceptic element - now out of government, the risk of Italy leaving the euro zone has tumbled. “All that matters ultimately for Italian government bonds is whether Italy leaves the euro (or the euro zone breaks up),” said Mike Riddell, head of UK fixed income at Allianz Global Investors. “The Italian government is arguably now the most market friendly in its history, and we therefore see a negligible risk of Italy wanting to leave the euro (or a euro zone breakup) over the next 12 months.” Euro break-up risk has been a key driver of Italian bonds in recent years, and the easing of such risks boosts the appeal of one of the few positive-yielding debt markets in the bloc. Indicators closely tracked by analysts support this view: 1/ Take the performance of Italian bonds denominated in dollars versus those issued in euros.  The yield on a 15-year euro-denominated Italian bond, or BTP, hit a record low in early September IT15YT=RR, while the yield on a similar maturity bond denominated in dollars is near seven-week highs IT016409294=. (Graphic: Italy's ""dollar"" bonds underperform as ""Quitaly"" fears fade, ) Investors believe dollar bonds, governed by New York law, would offer stronger protection against debt restructuring, including currency redenomination, than the euro issues governed by Italian law. So, whenever concern over Italy arises, dollar-denominated BTPs outperform their euro peers. That happened after the 2016 Brexit vote in Britain, in 2017 when anti-euro far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen surged in opinion polls ahead of elections, and last year when Italy's government quarreled with the EU over spending policy. While the dollar bonds' recent underperformance is down partly to speculation of a new dollar issue, investors said the removal of “Quitaly” risks was crucial, especially as other indicators too suggest a reduced risk of Italy exiting the euro. For most of last year, Italian bonds linked to local inflation performed better than those linked to euro zone inflation - the view was a return to the lira would result in significant currency devaluation, and subsequently, higher inflation. These fears accelerated after the League proposed issuing short-term bills known as mini-BOTs to settle state arrears. These could become a parallel currency and represent a de facto step toward leaving the euro, markets believed. But with the League no longer in power, the yield on an Italian bond maturing in 2023 and linked to euro zone inflation, IT532934= has fallen almost 90 bps since early August. A similar maturity bond linked to local inflation has seen yields slip 71 bps IT525367=. “The key really is the fact that (Matteo) Salvini and the League are not involved and this has been a turning point for Italian politics,” said Mohammed Kazmi, a portfolio manager at UBP.  “It has meant that investors have become more relaxed somewhat on fearing market unfriendly headlines whether that's something negative on the euro or something very expansionary on fiscal policy.”  Italy's new finance minister, Roberto Gualtieri, has signaled that he wants to avoid a clash with the EU. (Graphic: Italian BTP linked to euro zone inflation outperforms as ""Quitaly"" fears fade, ) Kazmi said the sharp fall in insurance that investors take out against a sovereign default and a tightening in the Italian/German bond yield gap perhaps offer the best evidence that investors are more relaxed about “Quitaly” and a euro breakup. Italy's 10-year bond yield premia over Germany has tumbled almost 200 basis points from highs above 300 bps reached late last year DE10IT10=RR. Five-year credit default swaps earlier this month fell to their lowest since just before the May 2018 bond rout ITGV5YUSAC=MG All that, alongside new ECB asset purchase plans and sliding debt-servicing costs, are easing concerns about Italy's credit rating outlook. Michele Napolitano, head of the western European sovereign ratings team at Fitch, said more detail on  fiscal policy was needed before any improvement in the BBB rating - two notches above junk. But he told a conference last week: “Any EU exit is off the table.”     (Graphic: Market indicators show ""Quitaly"" risk ebbing, ) ","{'neg': 0.08, 'neu': 0.854, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': -0.7549}",-0.7549
NY Fed's Williams says NY Fed actions had desired effect of reducing market strains,Sep 23 2019,"NEW YORK () - New York Federal Reserve President John Williams on Monday defended the bank's handling of volatility in money markets last week, saying officials anticipated the liquidity crunch and were successful in easing the markets.  Williams also emphasized the need for urgency for financial firms to move away from using Libor, a benchmark that is being phased out in a few years. The bank president spoke in New York at a Treasury markets conference attended by regulators, financial firms and other market experts. “We were prepared for such an event, acted quickly and appropriately, and our actions were successful,” Williams said. His remarks followed a week of unusual volatility in the overnight lending markets for cash - a typically sleepy part of financial markets.  The New York Fed had to intervene and inject billions of dollars of cash into the financial system to address a shortage in the cash available to help banks finance their short-term funding needs. The repo rate, a key measure of liquidity in the global banking system, shot up to 10% on Tuesday, or more than four times the federal funds rate.  Williams said on Monday that officials anticipated some developments that were expected to reduce liquidity, including quarterly corporate tax payments and the settlement of Treasury auctions, but said the reaction in the repo market was “outside of recent experience.” Repo rates returned to more normal levels after the Fed made  multiple rounds of repo operations. On Friday, the bank said it would keep pouring tens of billions of dollars a day into the U.S. banking system through early October.  “These actions had the desired effect of reducing strains in markets,” he said. Williams also urged financial firms to finalize their plans for replacing Libor, a benchmark that is linked to $200 trillion in financial contracts. The rate, which was tainted after it was revealed that financial firms rigged the rate to steal billions of dollars in profits, could be eliminated by the end of 2021 but banks have been slow to move to a replacement benchmark.  “We are now 831 days away from that world, and while some institutions are making good progress, others are sticking their metaphorical heads in the sand, hoping the issue will go away,” Williams said.  The central bank official said the New York Fed is taking steps to make it easier for firms to potentially use the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as a replacement benchmark. The New York Fed is preparing a SOFR index and aims to publish average SOFR rates daily by the middle of next year. The SOFR rate, which measures the costs of borrowing cash overnight, is viewed by some investors as a more reliable benchmark because it is based on more volume of trading than the Libor. Williams stressed that banks should not wait to adjust the loans and investments that are tied to Libor.  “There's no one-size-fits-all approach for closing out or converting existing LIBOR positions so market participants need to get ahead of this issue,” he said. “A lot of progress has been made, but there's still much to do.”  ","{'neg': 0.033, 'neu': 0.896, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': 0.9581}",0.9581
Climate activists hold event to mark vanishing Swiss glacier,Sep 22 2019,"Mels, Switzerland () - Hundreds of climate activists paid their respects to a Swiss glacier on Sunday that is due to disappear over the next decade, the victim of a warming environment. The Pizol glacier, now at less than a tenth of a square km, in the Glarus Alps in eastern Switzerland has been retreating as temperatures climb. Located about 2,600 meters (8530 ft) above sea level, the glacier is due to vanish completely by 2030. “I have climbed up here countless times,” said Matthias Huss glaciologist at ETH Zurich university, addressing the people who joined the march. “It is like the dying of a good friend.” At roughly 0.06 square km (0.02 square miles), the glacier is just a fraction of its area in 1987 when scientists recorded it at 0.32 square km. Just four years ago, its area was put at 0.1 square km, according to the Global Glacier Change Bulletin.  The gathering in Switzerland, which has about 1,500 glaciers, mirrors an action in August when activists and others in Iceland commemorated a melted glacier there. In Switzerland, climate change activism has been rising, including action this year in which dozens of people were arrested after blocking entrances to Swiss banks some people blame for their role in financing energy projects that are reliant on fossil fuels. Moreover, the country famous for its direct democracy may soon vote on going climate neutral, after organizers of a petition drive called “the Glacier Initiative” collected 120,000 signatures needed to put the measure on the ballot.  “We can't save the Pizol glacier anymore,” said Huss. But if people acted now, many of the negative effects of climate change could be contained. “Let's do everything we can, so that we can show our children and grandchildren a glacier here in Switzerland a hundred years from now.” ","{'neg': 0.059, 'neu': 0.899, 'pos': 0.041, 'compound': -0.7599}",-0.7599
"Eyeing elections, Britain's Labour Party pledges more spending, less work",Sep 23 2019,"BRIGHTON, England () - Britain's Labour Party pledged on Monday to mobilize financial resources on a scale not seen since the country was rebuilt after World War Two, promising a four-day working week and to spend more on social services if it gets into power. Out of office for nearly a decade, Labour is hoping to use the Brexit chaos engulfing Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ruling Conservative Party to win control of the world's fifth largest economy at an election expected to be called later this year. Presenting himself as Britain's finance minister in waiting at Labour's annual conference in Brighton, veteran left-winger John McDonnell explained how he would reshape the pro-business, free-market orthodoxy that has guided the country for decades. “We're mobilizing financial resources on a scale not seen since the post-War reconstruction to achieve the twin goals of a sustainable future and a better today,” said McDonnell, who has spent a lifetime campaigning to rip up the capitalist system. With Johnson fighting to keep his divided party together over Brexit, and huge uncertainty over how, when, or even if, Britain will leave the European Union, the result of a national election is hard to predict. The Labour Party's plans for widespread nationalization, higher public spending, higher taxes and forcing large corporations to give workers shares, have provoked deep concern among investors and business lobby groups. “With Brexit and global trade uncertainty to contend with, Labour should be reaching for the carrot rather than the stick in its approach to business and economic growth,” said Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. In his speech, McDonnell also repeated Labour's promise to hold a second referendum on leaving the European Union, warning that Johnson's government was fuelling uncertainty and undermining democracy with its Brexit policy. FOUR-DAY WEEK? McDonnell's most eye-catching announcement was a pledge to reduce the average working week to 32 hours within a decade, from about 37 hours now, as measured by the Office for National Statistics.  “It will be a shorter working week with no loss of pay,” McDonnell said to loud cheers from party members gathered in the English seaside resort. Labour said this could be achieved by boosting the power of collective bargaining, creating an independent body to gradually raise holiday entitlements and ending a British opt out from EU directives on how many hours people can work per week. “Who would turn down a four day week on the same pay? But without productivity gains it would push many businesses into loss,” said Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI business lobby group. Polling firm YouGov said almost two thirds of businesses backed a four-day working week, citing a survey of 502 business managers in June and July, while separate data showed 63% of workers supported working fewer hours. McDonnell also pledged to pump billions into social care, primarily to provide the elderly with free assistance for basic tasks such as cooking and bathing. “Nothing is more important than dignity in retirement for those who have built our country and given younger generations the world we live in today,” McDonnell said. The care policy is estimated to cost 6 billion pounds ($7.5 billion) in 2020/21, rising to 8 billion a year by 2030/31. The party did not detail how it would be funded but pointed to its last election manifesto which said taxes would rise to boost spending on the wider social care system. McDonnell has already backed new taxes on Britain's financial services sector, and, in the 2017 election campaign, said he would raise income taxes on the highest earners. Labour's personal care policy addresses a sensitive subject for Britain's aging population - a demographic that votes in high numbers and can swing election outcomes.  In the 2017 election, a Conservative policy seen as unfairly penalizing dementia sufferers prompted a decline in the party's ratings and was cited as a major factor behind a disastrous result for then-prime minister Theresa May.

Pension funds and insurers pledge climate action at U.N. summit,Sep 23 2019,"UNITED NATIONS () - Insurers and pension funds managing $2.3 trillion pledged on Monday to shift their portfolios away from carbon-heavy industries in the hope of triggering snowballing climate commitments from other big investors. German insurer Allianz, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), and Swedish pension fund Alecta were among the founders of the new “Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance” launched at a United Nations climate summit. “Mitigating climate change is the challenge of our lifetime. Politics, business and societies across the globe need to act as one to rapidly reduce climate emissions,” Oliver Baete, chief executive of Allianz, said in a statement. As accelerating climate impacts become increasingly apparent via heatwaves, wildfires and receding coastlines, the financial sector is under growing pressure from activists, shareholders and regulators to respond. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who organized Monday's summit to try to boost stalling international efforts to control emissions, sees insurers and pensions funds as a crucial lever to transition the global economy off fossil fuels. These types of companies — called “asset owners” because they are the principal holders of retirement savings, or are investing customers' insurance premiums — represent some of the world's largest pools of capital.  Members of the new grouping pledged to align their portfolios with a goal enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming to limit the increase in average temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The importance of this target was underscored late last year when a report by the U.N.-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change spelled out the catastrophic consequences for people and nature if the world is allowed to get much hotter. Under current emissions pledges by governments, the Earth is on track for well over 3 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century — an outcome that scientists say could put the survival of modern industrial societies at risk. “CalPERS recognizes that climate change poses urgent and systemic risk given our responsibility to protect our members' financial assets and provide the long-term returns that can pay pensions for this and coming generations,” said Marcie Frost, chief executive of CalPERS. The pension funds and insurers said they would rebalance their portfolios to ensure their investments were carbon neutral by 2050, with intermediate targets set for 2025, 2030 and 2040. They also pledged to make regular public progress reports. The nucleus of founding members hope they will influence an ever-growing proportion of the world's other big pension funds and insurers to push high-carbon companies towards more sustainable economic activities. But members of the new grouping said they might also have to divest from heavily-polluting industries as a last resort if they proved unwilling to change their business models so they no longer pose a danger to the stability of the climate.  Michael Sabia, the chief executive of Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), one of Canada's biggest pension funds, said there could be huge opportunities for investors willing to finance a fast transition to clean energy.    “There's a lot of people who don't get it, but I do think it's moving – the issue is whether it's moving fast enough,” Sabia told . “It's speed that matters here.” The new coalition was organized by groups including the Geneva-based United Nations Environment Finance Initiative and Mission2020, a network to spur faster climate action led by Christiana Figueres, a former U.N. climate chief. Among the other founding members are PensionDanmark, Swedish pension manager AMF, Nordea Life & Pension, Norwegian insurer Storebrand (), and Swiss RE ().

Factbox: Lessors scramble to recover dozens of jets from Thomas Cook,Sep 23 2019,"() - Aircraft leasing companies are launching moves to recover dozens of Airbus passenger planes after the collapse of British travel group Thomas Cook TCG.L, market sources said. The overall group operates a fleet of 85 Airbus planes and 31 Boeing jets, or a total of 116 aircraft based across Europe, according to data from UK-based aviation consultancy IBA.  All except five are leased from a total of 38 leasing companies or investment vehicles led by top names in aviation finance. The fleet includes 63 Airbus aircraft that are potentially directly affected by the collapse. They are operated by three 100% Thomas Cook subsidiaries in the UK, Scandinavia and Spain.

"""Flash Boys"" exchange IEX drops out of corporate listings",Sep 23 2019,"NEW YORK, Sept 23 () - U.S. stock exchange operator IEX Group said on Monday it was exiting corporate listings to focus on other areas of its business after failing to make inroads on the incumbent listings exchanges, Nasdaq Inc and Intercontinental Exchange Inc's New York Stock Exchange. The listings business is fiercely competitive and IEX has won only a single listing, Interactive Brokers Group Inc , since it became an exchange in 2016. Interactive Brokers said it plans to move its stock back to Nasdaq, where it was listed before switching to IEX last year. “It's a business where the big exchanges are entrenched,” Brad Katsuyama, chief executive officer of IEX, said in an interview. New York-based IEX was thrust into the spotlight in 2014 when its founders were featured in the controversial book “Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,” which claimed that the markets were rigged to favor high-speed traders. The author, Michael Lewis, followed IEX's founders as they set out to build an exchange they believed would level the playing field for all traders. There was a lot of interest from companies about potentially listing on IEX after “Flash Boys” was released, but that momentum waned, Katsuyama said. Closely held IEX has recently been hitting record stock trading volumes, at just under 3% market share, as well as record revenues and profits, but listings have been a drag on that profitability, he said. IEX also recently launched a developer platform called IEX Cloud, a data normalization and storage business known as IEX Astral, and a data distribution service in areas outside of finance called IEX Event Stream. “It was a good time to kind of like think about what businesses we wanted to be and which ones we didn't,” said Katsuyama.

"Turkey could miss out on 700,000 tourists a year after Thomas Cook collapse: hotel federation",Sep 23 2019,"ISTANBUL () - Turkey could miss out on 600,000-700,000 tourists a year following the collapse of British tourism agency Thomas Cook TCG.L on Monday, the head of Turkey's Hoteliers Federation (TUROFED) said. TUROFED chairman Osman Ayik said the estimate was based on the number of tourists that had come to Turkey with Thomas Cook in recent years. He said those tourists may now decide against returning with other travel agencies. The world's oldest travel firm collapsed on Monday, stranding more than half a million holidaymakers around the globe and sparking the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history. Ayik said there were currently 45,000 tourists in Turkey from the United Kingdom and other European countries who had traveled with Thomas Cook. Dalaman Airport's website showed at least seven flights to several UK destinations scheduled to depart on Monday had been canceled. Tourism is a major source of income for Turkey, helping to shore up its current account deficit, especially in the summer months. About 40 million tourists visited in 2018, bringing in a revenue of $29.5 billion, according to official data.  “There are a large number of small businesses whose fates depend on Thomas Cook, especially in Mugla, Dalaman and Fethiye,” Ayik told , referring to popular destinations on Turkey's western coast. He said Thomas Cook owed 100,000-200,000 pounds each to some small hotels, which could suffer as a result of the travel agency's collapse.  Turkey's Tourism Ministry said earlier that it was working with the Finance Ministry to extend a loan support package to businesses that were affected.

"Swiss probe incident involving ex-Credit Suisse banker Khan, private detectives",Sep 23 2019,"ZURICH, Sept 23 () - Zurich prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into an incident last week in which private detectives allegedly shadowed ex-Credit Suisse banker Iqbal Khan and his wife, the district attorney's office said on Monday Khan, due to take up leadership of UBS's wealth management unit next month just three months after leaving Credit Suisse, filed a criminal complaint alleging threats and coercion in the Sept. 17 confrontation. Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung, without citing its sources, reported that Credit Suisse had hired three detectives to investigate whether Khan was seeking to lure its employees to UBS. The situation escalated when one of the men sought to take Khan's phone after he tried to take a photograph of the detectives' car, the newspaper reported. “As a result of a criminal complaint (by Khan)...the Zurich District Attorney has opened a criminal investigation into coercion/threat,” a prosecutors office spokesman said in an email. “We cannot give further details because this is an ongoing investigation.” Credit Suisse did not respond to questions from . Khan, via a spokesman, denied trying to poach Credit Suisse workers for his new employer. “Suspicions that he was trying to hire people away from Credit Suisse are absurd,” the spokesman said on Monday. Khan is a rising star in Swiss finance, the son of Pakistani immigrants who came to Switzerland when he was just 12 and who grew up in the Zurich suburbs to become one of the nation's top bankers. He has been mooted as a candidate to eventually lead one of the country's big banks, including Sergio Ermotti-led UBS. Swiss media, including financial industry website Inside Paradeplatz, reported that the incident last week began when the 43-year-old Khan and his wife were tailed in their automobile by another vehicle. Near the Swiss National Bank building in the heart of Zurich's financial district, Khan stepped from his car and attempted to photograph the other vehicle with his cell phone. The occupants fled after passers-by noticed the altercation, the SonntagsZeitung reported, adding the three men were eventually located and detained for questioning. Financial institutions including in Switzerland are covetous of their client-employee relationships, and sometimes place employees or ex-employees under intense scrutiny to ensure they do not violate non-compete clauses or other contractual obligations. “Mostly, such practices never meet the light of day,” Swiss reputation consultant Bernhard Bauhofer told Swiss tabloid Blick. Still, other experts said the tactics described in Khan's situation were “mafia methods” that had no place in the industry. “I can't remember anything similar in my long career,” former UBS and Credit Suisse CEO Oswald Gruebel told the newspaper. Khan announced his resignation from Credit Suisse in July “to pursue other opportunities”. In late August, Credit Suisse's arch rival UBS said Khan would co-head its flagship wealth management business starting on Oct. 1 as part of a broader shake-up of its executive board.

Danish pension funds back 'green transition' with $50 billion,Sep 23 2019,"COPENHAGEN () - Danish private pension funds on Monday pledged to invest more than $50 billion in green assets over the next decade to fight climate change, as part of Denmark's ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70% in 2030. The funds will invest 350 billion Danish crowns ($52 billion) in energy infrastructure, green stocks and bonds and energy efficient construction up to 2030, Danish pensions industry association Insurance and Pension Denmark said in a statement. The investment was first announced on Sunday by Denmark's prime minister Mette Frederiksen at a news conference in New York before the summit. Frederiksen recently took office on promises of setting a 70% reduction target in greenhouse gas emissions, one of the world's most ambitious, by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.  “Now we need to work on getting international investors on board. That is imperative to realize the green transition globally,” Frederiksen said in a statement.  The funds will bring the total green investments to 511 billion crowns. Danish private pension funds, which doesn't include public pension fund ATP, currently hold assets worth 3,100 billion crowns. Environmental groups say the New York climate summit is coming at a crucial time, as extreme weather events and spiking temperatures affect more people in more parts of the globe. Denmark's biggest private pension provider, PFA Pension, which manages more than 600 billion Danish crowns, will focus investments in offshore wind farms and photovoltaic energy as well as climate-friendly properties and energy storage.  “There are quite big financing needs in many energy projects,” Allan Polack, PFA's chief executive told  and said PFA would invest in both shares and bonds as well as stakes in unlisted companies and projects. “But the exciting thing about the energy sector is the transformation. We are trying to get BP, Shell and Total and others to adapt and become far more climate friendly in their energy production,” Polack said. More than 90 big companies, including Denmark's wind turbine maker Vestas and wind farm developer Orsted, both market leaders, have promised to slash emissions in a new campaign launched ahead of Monday's climate summit.

UK households' money worries greatest in nearly six years: IHS Markit,Sep 23 2019,"LONDON () - British households are more worried about their financial prospects now than at any time since 2013, partly because of concerns about the economic and political outlook as the country prepares to leave the European Union, a monthly survey showed on Monday. The IHS Markit Household Finance Index sank to a four-month low of 43.1 in September from August's 43.6, as households' relatively upbeat assessments of their current situation was undermined by darker future prospects. Willingness to make major purchases such as cars or holiday bookings was the lowest since December 2013, and the assessment of their financial situation in 12 months was the most negative since November 2013. “Political and economic uncertainty had caused nervousness surrounding job security,” IHS Markit economist Joe Hayes said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is determined to take Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31, without a transition agreement if necessary, despite opposition from parliament. Although unemployment is low and wage growth is at an 11-year high, Britain's economy shrank in the last quarter and subsequent business surveys have been weak, as companies blame the United States-China trade conflict and no-deal Brexit risks. “(The) latest data suggest that the robust performance of the UK labor market may not be sufficient to dispel the pessimistic financial outlook, which could ultimately see weaker consumption trends at a time where the economy hinges on domestic resilience,” Hayes said. Britain's Thomas Cook TCG.L, the world's oldest travel company, collapsed on Monday after struggling to pitch itself to a new generation of tourists. Despite their gloomier mood, households' expectations of Bank of England policy were little changed. Some 23% think the BoE will cut interest rates from the current 0.75% during the next 12 months, unchanged from August. Almost 60% think it will increase rates, up from 58%. Unlike their counterparts in the United States and euro zone, Britain's central bankers say they still intend to gradually raise rates if the government concludes a Brexit deal and the economy picks up.

"RPT-Global aviation leaders gather amid climate protests, MAX safety talks",Sep 23 2019,"(Repeating Sept. 22 story with no changes to text) By Allison Lampert MONTREAL, Sept 22 () - Global aviation leaders will be under pressure to deepen efforts to tackle airline emissions as they gather this week under the shadow of protests led by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. The 16-year-old, who inspired a ‘flight-shaming' protest movement against aviation and sailed across the Atlantic rather than board a plane, is expected to join a march on Friday in Montreal as 193 nations meet at the U.N. aviation agency. The International Civil Aviation Organization holds its assembly every three years and its 75th-anniversary gathering starting on Tuesday comes at a time of growing concerns about climate change and a six-month-old grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX jetliner. On Monday, the head of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, Steve Dickson, will brief global regulators about delayed progress in approving MAX flights, which were halted in March following two fatal crashes. The grounding is not on the agenda of the Sept. 24-Oct. 4 assembly but regulators will be anxious to avoid divisions on the sidelines over actions needed to restore the jet to service. The debate over aviation's impact on the environment will be a major topic for the public side of the talks, however. Commercial flying accounts for 2.5% of carbon emissions. But with passenger numbers forecast to double to 8.2 billion by 2037, experts say emissions will rise if no action is taken. At its last full meeting in 2016, ICAO fostered the first global industrial climate initiative with a medium-term scheme to help airlines avoid adding to their net emissions from 2020. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) requires most airlines to limit emissions or offset them by buying credits from environmental projects. The industry says around $40 billion in climate financing will be generated between 2020 and 2035. The move eased the threat of a trade war after the European Union initially imposed its own emissions scheme unilaterally, but environmentalists say it did not go far enough. The EU, some campaigners and the industry itself want ICAO to commit now to setting longer-term goals at its 2022 assembly - though they may well differ sharply over what they should be. Andrew Murphy, aviation manager at the Brussels-based campaign group Transport & Environment, said climate protests led by Thunberg may put more pressure on the assembly. “Discussions in ICAO on boosting climate ambitions have been stuck in neutral for years - Greta's presence could inject much needed urgency to the debate,” he told . ICAO secretary general Fang Liu said she would be open to meeting Thunberg in Montreal. “Our goal is the same goal as Greta's,” she said. The aviation industry has committed to a target of halving net emissions by 2050, compared to 2005 levels, but there is no comparable long-term climate target for aviation set by countries in any international agreement, including the 2016 Paris accord. The industry and others believe ICAO can help come up with such a goal. The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), which commissioned research that led to the ‘Dieselgate' auto industry scandal, said last week emissions from commercial flights are rising up to 70% faster than predicted by the United Nations. Airlines insist they can't tackle the problem alone and are pushing for government help for technology such as alternative fuels.

Britain's opposition Labour plans to abolish private schools,Sep 23 2019,"BRIGHTON, England, Sept 23 () - Britain's main opposition Labour Party has agreed to abolish private schools, a move for which finance policy chief John McDonnell said on Monday the party would begin drawing up proposals. At its annual conference in the English seaside resort of Brighton, the Labour Party passed a motion supported by leftist groups to abolish private schools and integrate them into the state sector to help dismantle “the privilege of a tiny”. Labour is introducing new policies at its conference, hoping to present itself as a government in waiting to replace Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who went to the elite Eton school, at an election widely expected to come before the end of the year. About seven percent of British pupils are educated at private schools, but critics say they dominate places at top universities and are far overly-represented in senior roles in politics, law, media and business. Two-thirds of Johnson's cabinet of senior ministers attended private school and David Cameron, who was prime minister from 2010-2016, also went to Eton. “Now the discussions will take place exactly how that will work. You can see this developing over time,” finance policy chief John McDonnell told Sky News. “What we're saying is ‘let's have one education service for everybody. Let's end these grotesque levels of inequality within our educational system'.” ","{'neg': 0.02, 'neu': 0.908, 'pos': 0.072, 'compound': 0.7845}",0.7845

"Spain's bond yields fall after ratings upgrade, PMIs, Draghi in focus",Sep 23 2019,"* Euro zone periphery govt bond yields  By Dhara Ranasinghe LONDON, Sept 23 () - Euro zone bond yields dipped on Monday ahead of key business activity surveys and testimony by ECB chief Mario Draghi to the European parliament, with sentiment towards Spain buoyed by an upgrade to its credit rating by S&P Global. S&P on Friday lifted Spain's credit rating to A from A-, citing economic resilience and an improving budgetary position. It changed the country's rating outlook to stable from positive. Rival ratings agency DBRS also changed the outlook on Spain's rating to positive from stable, which suggests the next move could be an upgrade. It rates Spain at A. In early trade, Spain's 10-year bond yield fell 2.5 basis points to 0.216%, its lowest in over a week. It outperformed Italian and Portuguese peers. The 10-year bond yield spread over top-rated Germany was at around 73 basis points. The gap has narrowed more than 40 bps this year as weak economic growth and expectations for monetary stimulus pushed bond yields across the single currency bloc sharply lower. Jim McCormick, global head of desk strategy at NatWest Markets, said Spain's average ratings score is now the highest in seven years. “Spain's fundamentals already look more semi-core than peripheral,” he said. “Importantly, this is slowly bringing Japanese investors into the market in bigger size.” Japanese investors bought a net 33.8 billion yen of Spanish bonds in July according to data from Japan's Ministry of Finance. Analysts said the positive ratings news for Spain could help offset political uncertainty ahead of snap elections in November. Spain's Socialist party would win a November election and gain more seats, two polls showed on Sunday, but it would fall short of a majority and will still need support from other parties to form a government. Elsewhere, most 10-year euro zone bond yields were a touch lower on the day ahead of the “flash” or first reading of business activity surveys in the region for September. European Central Bank chief Draghi speaks to the European Parliament later in the day. Earlier this month, the ECB unleashed a fresh wave of stimulus measures including rate cuts and asset purchases to boost economic growth and inflation.

"RPT-Eyes on U.S. prize, Primark considers Central American suppliers",Sep 23 2019,"(Repeats SEPT 22 story. No change to text.) * Owner AB Foods has fine-tuned Primark model in U.S. * Is confident Primark will be a winner in U.S. * Looking to central America for clothing supplies * Has invested about 250 mln stg so far By James Davey LONDON, Sept 23 () - Confident it can crack the $300 billion U.S. clothing and shoes market where many other foreign retailers have failed, Britain's Primark is ready to raise its bet on the country by securing new sources of fast fashion in central America. Primark, whose trendy clothes at rock-bottom prices have taken UK shoppers by storm, opened in Boston in 2015 and now has nine stores in the northeast, all served by a warehouse in Pennsylvania that could still serve three times as many stores. It has invested 250 million pounds ($313 million) in the United States, achieved a critical mass of sales and has a four-year education under its belt on a crowded market that is battling to stay afloat in the face of rapid e-commerce growth. Now its owner, London-listed conglomerate Associated British Foods, is convinced Primark's disciplined store-by-store approach can succeed in a country that has been a graveyard for some of Britain's biggest retailers, including Marks & Spencer, Tesco and most recently Philip Green's Topshop. “I believe that the U.S. will be a winner for Primark,” John Bason, AB Foods' finance director, told . That confidence is underlined by a move to create a supply chain closer to the U.S. market. Primark currently sources all its clothes for the United States from its traditional supplier countries of China, India, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Vietnam and Turkey - a costly exercise as stock is freighted across the Pacific, through the Panama Canal and up the U.S eastern seaboard. The plan now is to tap suppliers from countries in central America, such as Guatemala, Costa Rica and Mexico. “We're getting to that point now, with the sales level that we've got in the U.S. already,” said Bason, a 20-year veteran of AB Foods. “Certainly countries in central America I think would really start to come through.” Founded by the late Arthur Ryan in Dublin in 1969, Primark trades from 373 stores in 12 countries, turning over 7.5 billion pounds and making 843 million pounds of profit in its 2017-18 financial year, a near fourfold increase in ten years - all achieved without venturing into online shopping. Primark, Britain's biggest fashion retailer by number of items sold, has made its mark on price, selling T-shirts and swimsuits for as a little as five pounds - its customers often laden with its trademark brown paper bags. Those economics make an online offer untenable. Primark contributes more than half of the total profit of its parent, which also owns major sugar and grocery arms and has a stock market value of 18 billion pounds. Some analysts believe Primark's combination of value, fashionability and breadth of range, means it could build a U.S. business over the next decade as big as its one in Europe. That would threaten value fashion retailers like Old Navy, American Eagle and Target on their own turf, and pitch it against Sweden's H&M, which trades from 578 stores in the United States, and Spain's Inditex, which has 102. Primark's tenth U.S. store will open at American Dream, New Jersey, this autumn, followed by one in Florida in 2020, its first outside the northeast corridor. Contracts have also been exchanged on a store in Chicago. Stores in highly populated cities on the eastern seaboard at locations with high footfall will follow. Bason said a decision to downsize three Primark stores - Freehold Raceway in New Jersey, Danbury Fair in Connecticut and King of Prussia in Pennsylvania - was critical to fine tuning its U.S. model. Sales levels were maintained from smaller footprints - sales densities went up, while operating costs went down, which meant profitability improved. Conversely the profitability of the Boston store was raised by increasing its size. “If you talk about learnings, that really was the key, it's the big one,” said Bason. “You add more stores and each one a profitable store, then the overall profitability will increase ... now you are in a virtuous circle.” AB Foods said this month that Primark was delivering strong sales growth in the United States and forecast a significantly reduced operating loss for 2018-19, which reflects the deliberate under utilisation of its warehouse. “At some point ... you would then put a second warehouse somewhere else, strategically placed, and start to add stores from that location,” said Bason, noting any move into California would necessitate a warehouse west of the Rocky Mountains. “The thing that goes to the heart of Primark is learn about the individual market - it was always Arthur's mantra.” ","{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.862, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': 0.9966}",0.9966

Poorest people getting world's small change to cope with climate crisis,Sep 23 2019,"BARCELONA (Thomson  Foundation) - The world's poorest people, increasingly buffeted by storms, floods and droughts, have been getting less than 1 cent a day each in international help to protect them from wild weather and rising seas as the Earth heats up, aid group Oxfam said Monday. Its analysis of global funding for developing countries to adapt to climate change was released as world leaders gathered in New York for a U.N. summit where they have been asked to set out how they will do more to rein in global warming. Poorer nations - many in places where climate change effects are hitting the hardest - have long demanded more financial support so they can build stronger homes, plant hardier seeds on farms, put in irrigation and warn citizens of dangerous weather.  “Millions of people are already living with the threat of deadly storms, rising floodwater and failed crops,” said Danny Sriskandarajah, chief executive of Oxfam GB.  “Wealthy nations ... should take urgent action to reduce emissions and provide financial support to the poorest communities to cope with the impact of climate change,” he added in a statement. In the past year, drought in the Horn of Africa has left more than 15 million people in need of aid in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya, while in Mozambique, 2.6 million require essentials after two powerful cyclones caused devastation, Oxfam said.  Yet cash for poor communities and countries to stay safe from weather shocks including storms and floods, and to cope with chronic stresses like drought has been slow to come. Oxfam calculated that, after excluding loans that must be repaid, the 48 least-developed countries received $2.4 billion-$3.4 billion in both 2015 and 2016 - the latest data available - equaling $2.50-$3.50 per inhabitant per year. In 2009, wealthy countries at U.N. talks agreed to channel $100 billion annually by 2020 to help poor nations develop in a low-carbon way and adapt to growing climate change impacts.  This month, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said donor governments had raised just over $71 billion in 2017, up from nearly $59 billion in 2016, including investment they helped secure from the private sector. OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría said the goal of reaching $100 billion by 2020 was still attainable.  “But we must urgently step up our efforts,” he added. Another issue is that calls from developing states and aid groups for half of international climate funding to back projects to adapt to a warmer world have gone largely unheeded.   Estimates of international climate finance from the OECD and others show adaptation finance stuck at barely more than a fifth of the total, with the bulk going to efforts to cut emissions. Leonardo Martinez-Diaz, director of sustainable finance at the World Resources Institute, said adaptation was “woefully under-funded”, and overall “a last big push” would be needed to ensure next year's $100 billion promise was met. “Getting to the $100 billion isn't just an arithmetical exercise to get the box ticked,” he said, explaining the money was vital for developing countries to implement more ambitious national climate plans. Many are looking to Monday's U.N. climate summit to send a strong signal that money is coming, and offer a platform for governments to make new financing commitments. The Green Climate Fund (GCF), set up under U.N. climate talks, is replenishing its coffers this year, and is hoping for fresh contributions in New York.  So far, five large donor countries have promised to put in nearly $6 billion more - and up to 10 governments, including Sweden, are expected to step up with new pledges on Monday. A GCF spokesman said those could help build confidence among developing states that they could afford to ramp up their national climate plans in 2020, as countries are supposed to do. At the summit, the least-developed countries - including Bhutan, Ethiopia, Gambia, Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda - plan to ask for $450 million in investment over 10 years for a new adaptation initiative as part of a “2050 Vision” to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and boost climate resilience. And at a meeting on Tuesday, governments are due to announce new contributions to the Least Developed Countries Fund, which helps vulnerable nations adapt to climate change, the Global Environment Facility said. Nonetheless, Niranjali Amerasinghe, executive director of ActionAid USA, said rich countries were still “nowhere near close to pulling their weight” on climate finance. She noted - as did Oxfam's report - that the bulk of money is being given as loans that must be paid back. “Many developing countries are already heavily in debt, so giving them more debt in order to address climate change is not a viable solution in the long run,” she told journalists.

"RPT-China needs to change way it finances economy, think tank says",Sep 23 2019,"(Repeats story issued late on Sunday) HANGZHOU, China, Sept 22 () - China needs to develop a better system for financing small businesses that drive innovation in the economy but currently struggle to access the funds they need for growth, a leading Chinese think-tank said in a report published Sunday. China's economic development over the past 40 years has taken place through a financial system that has high government intervention and is “absolutely dominated by banks”, the China Finance 40 Forum said in an annual report. Such a model, however, tends to distort financial resources in favour of large companies, the report said. That comes at the expense of smaller firms, which are the main drivers of innovation in the economy but usually lack the necessary assets for collateral or government guarantees to secure finance for growth. Financial regulators have also failed to prevent certain financial risks, the report said. The current financial system “is clearly not well suited to the core task of current high-quality economic development. Therefore, an important task of financial reform should be to adjust the financial structure,” the report said. China Finance 40 Forum is a think tank that focuses on economics and finance policy research and comprises members from regulators, universities and financial institutions. China's reliance on technological innovation for future economic growth has made changing the structure of the financial system an urgent matter, said Huang Yiping, the report's leading author and a professor of economics at the National School of Development of Peking University. Policymakers need to develop a multi-layered financing structure and reduce control over capital markets to open funding channels for innovative firms, Huang said. Only about 10% of total financing for Chinese companies comes directly from the financial markets, well below 43% for the United States and 23% for Britain, Huang said. Banks should be encouraged to link small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with the country's capital markets, said Yang Kaisheng, a consultant for the think tank and former president of China's largest lender Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.  Yang said there was also a need to set up a policy bank focused on SMEs involved in technology and innovation. Policymakers should also temper their current crackdown on shadow banking, it added.

"Eyeing elections, Britain's Labour plan care spending boost",Sep 23 2019,"BRIGHTON, England, Sept 22 () - Britain's opposition Labour Party will on Monday set out a 6 billion pound per year plan to help look after elderly people, as it pitches its economic agenda for a socialist-run country at the party's annual conference. Labour is hoping to use the Brexit chaos engulfing Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government to win control of Britain's $2.8 trillion economy at an early election expected to be called later this year. Presenting himself as Britain's finance minister in waiting, veteran left-winger John McDonnell will set out a series of policies to reshape the pro-business, free-market orthodoxy that has guided the British economy for decades. Extracts of the speech released late on Sunday highlighted a pledge to pump billions into the country's social care system, aimed primarily at providing the elderly with free assistance for basic tasks like cooking meals and bathing. “Nothing is more important than dignity in retirement for those who have built our country and given younger generations the world we live in today,” McDonnell will say. The 68 year-old, once considered on the extremes of Britain's political spectrum after a lifetime spent campaigning to tear up the capitalist system, is now seen by investors as a possible custodian of the world's fifth largest economy. The care policy is estimated to cost 6 billion pounds in 2020/21, rising to 8 billion pounds per year by 2030/31. The party did not explicitly set out how this would be funded, but pointed to its manifesto at the last election which set out tax rises to pay for more funding for the wider social care system. McDonnell has already backed new taxes on Britain's financial services sector, and, in the 2017 election campaign, said he would raise income taxes on the highest earners. “We're going to re-shape the economy,” McDonnell told an anti-austerity rally in Brighton on Sunday on the eve of his speech, promising to have a budget and legislative agenda ready if Labour wins power. “I think this must be the important one (election) that we'll face in generations. Both in terms of how we overturn all the austerity measures of the last nine years, and also in terms of how we take control of our economy.” The Labour party's plans for widespread nationalisation, higher public spending, higher taxes and forcing large corporations to give workers shares, have provoked deep concern among investors and business lobby groups. But, with Johnson fighting a battle to keep his divided party together over Brexit and huge uncertainty over how and when Britain will leave the EU - if it ever does - the result of a national election is hard to predict. The personal care policy strikes at a raw nerve for Britain's ageing population - a demographic that votes in high numbers and has the power to swing election outcomes.

"Oman not in talks with Gulf countries for financial aid, sees growth at 1.1%",Sep 23 2019,"KUWAIT () - Oman is not in discussions with Gulf countries for any aid package, an official said, despite a large fiscal deficit and expectations of a slowdown in economic growth this year. “Not from our side. I have not discussed anything,” Tahir Al Amri, executive president of the central bank, told reporters in Kuwait ahead of a banking conference this week.

"Global aviation leaders gather amid climate protests, MAX safety talks",Sep 23 2019,"MONTREAL () - Global aviation leaders will be under pressure to deepen efforts to tackle airline emissions as they gather this week under the shadow of protests led by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. The 16-year-old, who inspired a ‘flight-shaming' protest movement against aviation and sailed across the Atlantic rather than board a plane, is expected to join a march on Friday in Montreal as 193 nations meet at the U.N. aviation agency. The International Civil Aviation Organization holds its assembly every three years and its 75th-anniversary gathering starting on Tuesday comes at a time of growing concerns about climate change and a six-month-old grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX jetliner. On Monday, the head of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, Steve Dickson, will brief global regulators  about delayed progress in approving MAX flights, which were halted in March following two fatal crashes. The grounding is not on the agenda of the Sept. 24-Oct. 4 assembly but regulators will be anxious to avoid divisions on the sidelines over actions needed to restore the jet to service. The debate over aviation's impact on the environment will be a major topic for the public side of the talks, however. Commercial flying accounts for 2.5% of carbon emissions. But with passenger numbers forecast to double to 8.2 billion by 2037, experts say emissions will rise if no action is taken. At its last full meeting in 2016, ICAO fostered the first global industrial climate initiative with a medium-term scheme to help airlines avoid adding to their net emissions from 2020.   The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) requires most airlines to limit emissions or offset them by buying credits from environmental projects. The industry says around $40 billion in climate financing will be generated between 2020 and 2035. The move eased the threat of a trade war after the European Union initially imposed its own emissions scheme unilaterally, but environmentalists say it did not go far enough.  The EU, some campaigners and the industry itself want ICAO  to commit now to setting longer-term goals at its 2022 assembly - though they may well differ sharply over what they should be. Andrew Murphy, aviation manager at the Brussels-based campaign group Transport & Environment, said climate protests led by Thunberg may put more pressure on the assembly. “Discussions in ICAO on boosting climate ambitions have been stuck in neutral for years - Greta's presence could inject much needed urgency to the debate,” he told . ICAO secretary general Fang Liu said she would be open to meeting Thunberg in Montreal. “Our goal is the same goal as Greta's,” she said.      The aviation industry has committed to a target of halving net emissions by 2050, compared to 2005 levels, but there is no comparable long-term climate target for aviation set by countries in any international agreement, including the 2016 Paris accord. The industry and others believe ICAO can help come up with such a goal.   The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), which commissioned research that led to the ‘Dieselgate' auto industry scandal, said last week emissions from commercial flights are rising up to 70% faster than predicted by the United Nations. Airlines insist they can't tackle the problem alone and are pushing for government help for technology such as alternative fuels. “We can't wait until 2049 to take action,” said Michael Gill, director of the industry-led Air Transport Action Group.

"Make climate fight 'sexy,' says Japan's new environment minister",Sep 23 2019,"NEW YORK () - Japan's new environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, pledged on Sunday to mobilize young people to push his coal-dependent country toward a low-carbon future by making the fight against climate change “sexy” and “fun.” Koizumi was speaking on the eve of a United Nations climate summit in New York where activists plan to float a blimp showing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe emerging from a bucket of coal to protest Japan's pans to build new coal-fired power plants. “In politics there are so many issues, sometimes boring. On tackling such a big-scale issue like climate change, it's got to be fun, it's got to be cool. It's got to be sexy too,” Koizumi told a news conference in New York. “We are committed to realizing a decarbonised society, and we are ready to contribute as a more powerful country in the fight against climate change,” he said. Japanese students in Tokyo were among the millions of young people who took to the streets on Friday to express the fear and outrage they feel over the failure of governments to control greenhouse gas emissions, which hit a record high last year. Considered a rising star on Japan's political scene, Koizumi, 38, became the third youngest lawmaker to join a post-World War Two Japanese cabinet when Abe announced a reshuffle this month. The son of charismatic former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, he is regularly rated by voters as the lawmaker they would most like to see in the top job when Abe steps down.  Although Japan is not due to speak at the climate summit on Monday, Koizumi said he was in New York to learn more about the state of negotiations on global greenhouse gas emissions and meet Japanese students. He was speaking alongside Christiana Figueres, an architect of the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb global warming, who had invited him to meet various companies and banks aiming to accelerate investment in clean energy projects in Asia.  “It behooves the rest of the world to come together to support Japan, as well as the other Asian countries, to move beyond coal,” said Figueres, a Costa Rican diplomat who now leads Mission 2020, a campaign to accelerate climate action. “We need to make an extraordinary effort that will favor the new fuels that we all need to move in to,” she said. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has told governments they should only turn up to the summit if they came armed with more ambitious plans to cut carbon emissions under the Paris accord, which enters a crucial implementation phase next year. Guterres has also urged governments not to build any new coal power plants after 2020 - setting him at odds with Japan, which is the only G7 country to be adding coal-fired power generation capacity. Japan's government and banks also play an important role in financing new coal plants elsewhere in Asia. Nevertheless, Koizumi said he wanted Japan to do more on climate, invoking his country's role in forging the Kyoto Protocol, a climate treaty agreed in the Japanese city of Kyoto in 1997.  “We haven't taken the strong action and powerful leadership since then, but from now on, from today, we want to do more,” Koizumi said, without giving details. Koizumi sparked controversy shortly after being appointed when he told his first news conference that he wants Japan to close down nuclear reactors to avoid a repeat of the Fukushima catastrophe in 2011. Isshu Sugawara, newly-appointed as trade minister, responded by saying it would be unrealistic to rid Japan of nuclear power. Koizumi reiterated his opposition to nuclear power on Sunday. “I want to realize a society, a country, with no fear about the nuclear crisis,” he said. “But it isn't easy, it's a complicated issue. But I'll try my best to reduce the nuclear power in the future.” ","{'neg': 0.061, 'neu': 0.865, 'pos': 0.074, 'compound': -0.3766}",-0.3766
Banks worth $47 trillion adopt new U.N.-backed climate principles,Sep 23 2019,"UNITED NATIONS () - Banks with more than $47 trillion in assets, or a third of the global industry, adopted new U.N.-backed “responsible banking” principles to fight climate change on Sunday that would shift their loan books away from fossil fuels. Deutsche Bank (), Citigroup () and Barclays () were among 130 banks to join the new framework on the eve of a United Nations summit in New York aimed at pushing companies and governments to act quickly to avert catastrophic global warming. “These principles mean banks have to consider the impact of their loans on society – not just on their portfolio,” Simone Dettling, banking team lead for the Geneva-based United Nations Environment Finance Initiative, told . Under pressure from investors, regulators and climate activists, some big banks have acknowledged the role lenders will need to play in a rapid transition to a low-carbon economy. Financing for oil, gas and coal projects has come under particular scrutiny as climate scientists step up calls to change the global economy's deep reliance on fossil-fuels to avert disastrous warming. The principles, drawn up jointly by U.N. officials and banks, require lenders to: - Align their strategies with the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb global warming and U.N.-backed targets to fight poverty called the Sustainable Development Goals - Set targets to increase “positive impacts” and reduce “negative impacts” on people and the environment - Work with clients and customers to encourage sustainable practices - Be transparent and accountable about their progress. The principles' main backers say the norms will encourage banks to pivot their loan portfolios away from carbon-intensive assets and redirect capital to greener industries. Critics argue that banks should go much further by explicitly committing to phasing out financing for fossil fuel projects and agribusiness that drive deforestation in the Amazon, Southeast Asia and other regions. However, the new standards could also force participating banks to choose between foregoing business from clients in high-carbon sectors and the risk of being accused of backsliding on the principles if they continue to finance such firms. Although the initiative is voluntary, Dettling, who played a central role during 18 months of negotiations with a core group of 30 founding banks, said lenders would be reluctant to accept the reputational risk of losing their signatory status.  “They need to demonstrate that they are making progress — and progress within a given timeline,” Dettling said.  “Ultimately, banks that are not in line with their commitments and do not make progress can be stripped of their signatory status,” she said. Banks in Europe, in particular, also face growing regulatory pressure to disclose their exposure to the potential impact of climate-related disasters and a low-carbon energy transition on their asset base. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who has joined counterparts in France and the Netherlands to push for better supervision of climate risk, was due to address the U.N. climate summit on Monday, according to a draft agenda. Other banks to join the “Principles for Responsible Banking” initiative included Danske Bank (), ABN Amro (), BNP Paribas (), Commerzbank (), Lloyds Banking Group () and Societe Generale (), according to a statement.

"Box Office: 'Downton Abbey' Reigns Over 'Ad Astra,' 'Rambo: Last Blood' With $31 Million Debut",Sep 22 2019,"LOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - In a box office win fit for a queen, Focus Features' “Downton Abbey” ruled over the competition in North America. The big-screen continuation of the popular British TV show beat expectations with $31 million when it debuted in 3,079 theaters, setting a new opening weekend record for the studio. “Downton Abbey” easily surpassed newcomers “Ad Astra” and “Rambo: Last Blood,” which are in a close race for second place. Overseas, the royal period drama has collected $41 million to date for a worldwide tally of $61.8 million. Series creator Julian Fellowes wrote “Downton Abbey,” while Michael Engler directed. Much of the cast from the TV show — including Hugh Bonneville, Elizabeth McGovern, Michelle Dockery and Maggie Smith — returned for the film adaptation. Moviegoers, consisting mostly of older females, awarded the film with an A CinemaScore — the highest grade among this weekend's new offerings. For comparison, “Ad Astra” landed a B- and “Rambo: Last Blood” secured a B. As for “Downton Abbey,” 74% of ticket buyers were female and 60% were over the age of 35. “Audiences were clearly ready to come back to Downton and visit the Crawleys and all the familiar faces upstairs and downstairs,” said Lisa Bunnell, Focus Features president of distribution. “At its core, it's a story about family and audiences, both original fans and newcomers, are uplifted by that laughter and joy of the film.” Meanwhile, “Ad Astra” looks to have pulled slightly ahead of “Rambo: Last Blood” in North America, arriving on the higher end of projections with $19.2 million from 3,450 venues. Still, the astronaut drama starring Brad Pitt and directed by James Gray will need to have a long journey in multiplexes to justify its $80 million price tag. “Ad Astra” follows Roy McBride (Pitt), an astronaut on a mission across time and space to uncover the truth about his missing father. The cast also includes Tommy Lee Jones, Ruth Negga, Liv Tyler and Donald Sutherland. Though “Rambo: Last Blood” was forecasted to lead box office charts, the final chapter in Sylvester Stallone's action franchise should finish the weekend in third place. The film earned $19.015 million from 3,618 locations, in line with studio expectations and slightly ahead of 2008's “Rambo” ($18.2 million), the latest entry to grace the silver screen. Adrian Grunberg directed the film, which was co-written by Stallone. “Rambo: Last Blood” is expected to be Stallone's final go-around as John Rambo, a character first introduced to audiences in the 1980s. To no surprise, older men accounted for majority of opening weekend crowds: 66% of opening weekend crowds were male, while 42% were over the age of 30. After two weeks atop domestic box office charts, Warner Bros.' “It: Chapter Two” slid to No. 4. The sequel, based on Stephen King's terrifying novel, pulled in $17.2 million during its third outing for a domestic tally of $179 million. Rounding out the top five is STX's “Hustlers” with $17 million, an especially promising figure considering three new films debuted this weekend. After two weeks of release, “Hustlers” has amassed $62 million in North America and $9.84 million overseas for a worldwide haul of $72 million. The film — directed by Lorene Scafaria and starring Jennifer Lopez, Constance Wu, Keke Palmer and Lili Reinhart — cost $20 million to produce.

Indian shadow bank Altico says evaluating options after default,Sep 22 2019,"MUMBAI () - India's Altico Capital said on Sunday it was evaluating options to resolve its liquidity issues, following its recent default on an interest payment that was due earlier this month. Altico, backed by Clearwater Capital Partners and Abu Dhabi Investment Council, said it defaulted on the interest payment after a rating downgrade prompted several of its lenders to recall a substantial amount of debt causing it to face a liquidity squeeze. “This lack of capacity led Altico to pause further debt repayments in order to maintain itself as a going concern and to protect the interests of all stakeholders,” the company said in a statement on Sunday. Altico said it needed time from stakeholders to craft a plan that might “maximize asset value” and called on all stakeholders to “refrain from actions that exacerbate the liquidity problem.” “Altico has held a series of meetings with its creditors, with a view to agreeing a way forward that the company expects will allow it to meet its financial commitments,” it said, adding that it had appointed financial and legal advisors to support the discussions. Non-banking financial companies and housing finance companies have been stung by liquidity crisis after the collapse of behemoth Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd late last year.  That has led to a contagion effect on players in the shadow banking sector with funding drying up and borrowing costs surging, and, experts say, is partly responsible for the ongoing economic slowdown in the country.

Deutsche Bahn sees big windfall from climate change package,Sep 22 2019,"BERLIN () - Germany's Deutsche Bahn [DBN.UL] expects the government's 50 billion euro climate change package to generate the railway company's biggest growth spurt in its 180-year history, the state-owned firm's boss said on Sunday. In a telephone press conference, Richard Lutz said the measures announced on Friday, including a cut in value-added tax (VAT) on train tickets, would give it an additional 20 billion euros in revenue by 2030. Although the package, in response to growing public concern about the impact of climate change, disappointed climate activists, individual measures such as surcharges on domestic flights and the VAT cut are expected to have an impact on the companies concerned.  “We are now on the attack and rebuilding,” he said. Europe's railway companies are expected to be major beneficiaries of a shift away from car and air transport toward public transportation offerings that emit proportionally less carbon. The company planned to buy 30 new high-speed trains by 2023 to cater for the expected growth in passenger numbers, a one billion euro bonanza for train-building companies. The railway's current ICE-4 trains are built by Siemens () and Bombardier (), but Lutz said the new units would not be of the same type. France's Alstom () is another potential supplier. Financially strained Deutsche Bahn, which has been under fire over delays and for having insufficient capacity, said it would invest 11 billion euros of the extra cash in recapitalizing. Despite running at a profit, the company has had to take on extra debt to finance investment. Deutsche Bahn operates Europe's largest railway by track length, though at 39,000 km it is far shorter than at its peak length of 58,000 km.

Germany's Greens promise to strengthen climate plan after protests,Sep 22 2019,"BERLIN () - Germany's Greens said on Sunday they planned to use their strength in the upper house of parliament to sharpen a government climate protection package that disappointed many activists.     The party's Winfried Kretschmann - the popular premier of Baden-Wuerttemberg, one of Germany's richest and most industrialized states - said the package had been dominated by piecemeal measures and failed to take the key step: introducing an “honest and ambitious carbon price”. The climate package, unveiled on Friday after extensive haggling between Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and her Social Democrat coalition partners, set an initial carbon price of about 10 euros per ton, well short of the 40 euros many activists were hoping for. The Federal Council, Germany's upper house, represents the governments of the 16 states of the federation, in nine of which the Greens are a governing party, meaning they have an influence over an absolute majority of seats in the chamber. Annalena Baerbock, the Greens' co-leader, said the government had “wasted a historic opportunity”. “We will use every means to get more done to protect the climate,” she told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper. The Federal Council can veto or amend laws that affect states' finances and refer back all other laws to the lower house for reconsideration. The 50 billion euro package, setting out a roadmap for the greening of Europe's largest economy over coming decades, included incentives to buy electric cars, surcharges for domestic flights and extra money for the national railway. But the carbon price, rising from 10 euros to 35 euros by 2025, was received with widespread disappointment. “The proposals are completely inadequate,” climate economist Volker Quaschning told RTL. “The government is acting as if we had 200 years. If we did, then the measures would be fine, but not when we only have 15.” With environmental concerns surging up the list of voters' priorities after two unprecedentedly warm summers, a spate of forest fires and the chord struck by Great Thunberg's Fridays for Future movement, the Greens are soaring in polls, and are now vying with the conservatives for the top slot nationally. The party looks set to enter its 10th state government within coming weeks after elections led to talks in Brandenburg, the state surrounding Berlin, on forming a coalition of the SPD, conservatives and Greens.

"China needs to change way it finances economy, think tank says",Sep 22 2019,"HANGZHOU, China () - China needs to develop a better system for financing small businesses that drive innovation in the economy but currently struggle to access the funds they need for growth, a leading Chinese think-tank said in a report published Sunday. China's economic development over the past 40 years has taken place through a financial system that has high government intervention and is “absolutely dominated by banks”, the China Finance 40 Forum said in an annual report. Such a model, however, tends to distort financial resources in favor of large companies, the report said. That comes at the expense of smaller firms, which are the main drivers of innovation in the economy but usually lack the necessary assets for collateral or government guarantees to secure finance for growth. Financial regulators have also failed to prevent certain financial risks, the report said.  The current financial system “is clearly not well suited to the core task of current high-quality economic development. Therefore, an important task of financial reform should be to adjust the financial structure,” the report said.  China Finance 40 Forum is a think tank that focuses on economics and finance policy research and comprises members from regulators, universities and financial institutions. China's reliance on technological innovation for future economic growth has made changing the structure of the financial system an urgent matter, said Huang Yiping, the report's leading author and a professor of economics at the National School of Development of Peking University. Policymakers need to develop a multi-layered financing structure and reduce control over capital markets to open funding channels for innovative firms, Huang said. Only about 10% of total financing for Chinese companies comes directly from the financial markets, well below 43% for the United States and 23% for Britain, Huang said. Banks should be encouraged to link small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with the country's capital markets, said Yang Kaisheng, a consultant for the think tank and former president of China's largest lender Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.  Yang said there was also a need to set up a policy bank focused on SMEs involved in technology and innovation. Policymakers should also temper their current crackdown on shadow banking, it added. Though loosely regulated, the shadow banking sector serves as a supplement for traditional lending methods, said Xiao Gang, a senior researcher at the think tank and former chairman of China's securities regulator.

Only 1 in 2 Singaporeans feels fulfilled in life with finances seen as biggest obstacle: AXA survey,Sep 24 2019,"SINGAPORE - One in two Singaporeans does not feel fulfilled in life with finances cited as the biggest obstacle to achieving life goals, according to a survey commissioned by insurer AXA. For the inaugural AXA Better Life Index 2019, released on Tuesday (Sept 24), research firm Nielsen polled 1,008 Singaporeans aged 18-65 across four generations: Gen Z (18-24 years old), millennials (25-39), Gen X (40-54), and baby boomers (55-65). The survey evaluates the overall journey towards a better life among Singaporeans, taking into account three components: realisation, empowerment, and achievement. Across all four generations surveyed, wealth-related goals ranked high for both short-term and long-term goals. When questioned about the struggles faced in reaching goals, money-related matters such as the increasing cost of living (51 per cent), and the inability to save enough money (35 per cent) came up as the most common concerns. Overall, Singaporeans have a Better Life Index score of 50.4, with 41 per cent saying they are not happy with their lives currently, AXA said. Millennials (54.8) seem to be the most driven to achieve their goals in life, having scored the highest among the four generations. Jean Drouffe, chief executive officer of AXA Insurance Singapore, said: ""Self-belief fuels one's journey in life. That is why we strive to play a part in helping our customers feel confident that they can achieve their goals. With the AXA Better Life Index, we want to understand Singaporeans' progress towards achieving their better life, and how they can be encouraged as they work towards it."" The survey also found that while a majority of Singaporeans have set short-term (78 per cent) and long-term (56 per cent) goals, at least three in 10 have not set a clear timeline to achieve them. Unsurprisingly, younger Singaporeans held a higher regard for money as part of their life goals, while older age groups were more concerned with their health in the long run. Baby Boomers (57 per cent) were found to be the most fulfilled in their achievements, relationships and other aspects of life, while Generation Z (40 per cent) was the least fulfilled.","{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.849, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.9139}",0.9139

12 global initiatives to beat back climate threats,Sep 24 2019,"BARCELONA () - Close to 30 global initiatives to ramp up action on climate change were unveiled or expanded at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York, the United Nations said. Bringing together governments, businesses, development banks, cities and green groups, they cover everything from zero-carbon buildings to cleaning up air pollution and a platform for poor countries to access international finance for clean energy. Here are 12, announced alongside commitments by about 65 countries to upgrade their climate plans, with the aim of upping the world's chance of reducing planet-warming emissions to net zero by mid-century and meeting agreed temperature limits: 1. Almost 90 companies with a market capitalisation of more than US$2.3 trillion (S$3.17 trillion) and annual direct emissions equivalent to 73 coal-fired power plants pledged to take action to align their business plans with scientific targets laying out what is needed to keep global warming to 1.5 deg C. 2. The Powering Past Coal Alliance said it had added seven new members, to include 32 nations, 25 states or regions, and 34 companies committed to phasing out coal power generation and ending the building of new coal power plants by 2020. 3. The Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance, a group of the world's largest pension funds and insurers - which together manage US$2.3 trillion in investments - agreed to make their investment portfolios carbon-neutral by 2050. 4. The International Development Finance Club, a leading group of 24 national and regional development banks, set a goal of raising US$1 trillion by 2025 for climate action in poorer countries, with an increasing share of that going to work to help them adapt to climate threats and build greater resilience. 5. The City Climate Finance Gap Fund backed by the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, together with Germany and Luxembourg, said it would provide up to 50 million euros (S$75.7 million) in grants to develop low-carbon, climate-safe infrastructure projects in cities. It hopes to be able to double the grants to unlock at least 4 billion euros in investment, and will work with at least a dozen cities per year. 6. The Zero Carbon Buildings for All Initiative pledged to ensure new buildings produce no more climate-changing emissions than they can absorb by 2030, with existing buildings meeting that goal by 2050 in member countries around the world, which include Kenya, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Britain. 7. A new Climate Investment Platform will enable developing countries to access finance for clean energy investment more easily. Support for other areas of climate action, such as adaptation, land use, cities and infrastructure, would be added in 2020, its backers said. 8. The ""Three Per cent Club"", a coalition of 15 countries, as well as businesses and institutions, said it would work to drive a 3 per cent annual global increase in energy efficiency, up from 1.3% in 2018, by including measures in national plans and sharing expertise. 9. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank, the European Commission, Britain, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden and Germany promised to invest more than US$650 million in the CGIAR group of agricultural research centres over the next three years to help 300 million smallholder farmers in developing countries adapt to climate pressures. The funding is part of a broader commitment of more than US$790 million to address the impact of climate change on food and agriculture. 10. The Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment - a group of 34 companies and organisations managing assets worth US$5 trillion - said it aims to ensure that finance for infrastructure takes into account climate risks, leading to more robust roads, bridges, energy, telecoms and other key services. 11. The Clean Air Initiative will urge governments at national and local level to commit to achieving air that is safe and healthy, and to align their climate change and air pollution policies by 2030. A Clean Air Fund - with US$50 million in initial funding - also was launched to tackle outdoor air pollution and reduce related deaths.

Asia-Pacific's new climate reality: China Daily contributor,Sep 24 2019,"BEIJING (CHINA DAILY/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - On Monday (Sept 23), world leaders   to increase ambition and accelerate action in the face of a mounting climate emergency. For many, this means increased ambition and action to enable countries to de-carbonise their economies by the middle of the century. But that is only half the equation. Equally ambitious plans are also needed to build the resilience of vulnerable sectors and communities being battered by climate related disasters of increasing frequency, intensity and unpredictability. Nowhere is this reality starker than in the Asia-Pacific region which has suffered another punishing year of devastation due to extreme events linked to climate change. Last year, Kerala, a province in southern India,  . The floods in Iran in April this year were unprecedented. And   caused widespread destruction and loss of life. In several South Asian countries, immediately following a period of drought, weeks of heavy monsoon rains this month unleashed floods and landslides. Across Northeast and South Asia, record high temperatures have been set. Research from the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific show that intense heat waves and droughts are becoming more frequent; unusual tropical cyclones originate from beyond the traditional risk zones and follow tracks not been seen before; and unprecedented floods are occurring throughout the region. Science tells us that the impacts are only going to increase in severity and frequency as greenhouse gas emission concentrations in the atmosphere continue to rise. The poor and vulnerable are taking the biggest hit. Disasters cost lives and damage livelihoods and assets. Increasing exposure to disasters are increasing child malnutrition and mortality, and forcing poor families to take children out of school - entrenching inter-generational poverty. And they perpetuate inequalities within and between countries. A person a small island state in the Pacific is three to five times more at risk of disasters than a person elsewhere in our disaster-prone region. Vanuatu has faced annual losses of more than 20 percent of its GDP. In Southeast Asia, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam have all faced losses of more than 5 percent of their GDP. In short, disasters are slowing down and often reversing poverty reduction and widening inequality. But amid this cycle of disaster and vulnerability lies a golden opportunity for careful and forward-looking investment. The Global Commission on Adaptation has found that there will be more than US$7 trillion (S$9.6 trillion) in total net benefits between now and 2030 from investing in early warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, improved dry-land agriculture, mangrove protection, and in making water resources more resilient. So where can countries in the Asia-Pacific make a start? First, by providing people with the means to overcome shocks. Increasing social protection is a good start. At present, developing countries in the Asia-Pacific spend only about 3.7 percent of GDP on social protection, compared with the world average of 11.2 percent, leaving people vulnerable in case they fall sick, lose their jobs, become old or are hit by a disaster. In the aftermath of Typhoon Hyan in the Philippines, we saw the effectiveness of social protection, especially cash transfers, but those were only possible because the government could use the conditional cash transfer system and mechanism already in place for poor and vulnerable people. Second, by lifting the financial burden off the poor. Disaster risk finance and insurance can cover poor and vulnerable people against climate shocks and help them recover from a disaster, such as Mongolia's index-based insurance scheme to deal with the increased frequency of dzud (a severe winter in which a large number of livestock die due to starvation mainly because they cannot graze). Disaster risk finance can also help countries pool the risks as is happening through the emerging ASEAN Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance program. Third, by increasing investment in new technologies and big data. Artificial intelligence driven risk analytics, as well as a fast combination of sensor and geospatial data, can strengthen early warning systems. Big data, including from mobile phones, can help identify and locate vulnerable populations in risk hotspots which have been the hardest to reach so far, ensuring faster more targeted help after disasters. Experience around the region has already shown the potential. In India, a combination of automated risk analytics, geospatial data and the digital identity system has helped been designed to identify and deliver assistance to millions of drought-affected subsistence farmers. But much more investment is needed to make technology an integral part of disaster risk response and resilience building. Climate related disasters are likely to increase in the Asia-Pacific. This is our new climate reality.","{'neg': 0.177, 'neu': 0.759, 'pos': 0.065, 'compound': -0.9983}",-0.9983

These are: Turnover, profitability, business expansion, capital investment, hiring, capacity utilisation, and access to financing.

Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  Overall, the index fell from 50.8 to 50.6, reversing the uptrend last quarter. A reading above 50 indicates that companies expect business to improve in the next six months, while a reading below 50 indicates that they expect lower business activity. All seven sub-indicators saw declining expectations in the latest survey, said SBF and Experian on Monday (Sept 23). They added that the slowing economy has contributed to declines in expectations in turnover, profitability, business expansion, capital investment and hiring. The manufacturing sector in particular saw negative turnover expectations as a result of a global slowdown in demand for manufactured goods. Profitability expectations fell as well, marking five consecutive quarters of negative expectations. There was also a decline in hiring expectations among manufacturing SMEs, likely due to adjustments in firms' expansion and hiring plans amid a more subdued global outlook, the survey found. Lenders appear to be more wary in extending loans to these firms, with the sector seeing the biggest drop in expectations for access to financing. Manufacturing is not the only sector that has seen dampened sentiment. With no apparent end in sight for the US-China trade war, SMEs in the commerce and trading sector are looking to lower trade volumes, leading to negative profitability and turnover expectations. This represents the fourth straight quarter of negative profit growth expectations for SMEs in the sector. These firms are showing less investment appetite as well, suggesting they are ""scaling back growth prospects and doubling down on existing resources"" to tide through the period. While SMEs in the retail and food and beverage sector have displayed the most optimism in turnover expectations, they too saw an overall decline in sentiment. The sector, which registered the biggest slide in optimism around business expansion, appears to be managing aspirations as well in view of a challenging environment for the foreseeable future. ""This is supported by the sector's decline in capital investment expectations, reversing three consecutive quarters of growth,"" they said. Only the construction sector emerged unscathed, registering positive gains in several indicators. SBF and Experian attributed this to ""strong public sector construction activities"", with about 60 per cent of construction demand in 2019 expected to come from the public sector. Mr James Gothard, Experian's general manager for credit services and strategy in South-east Asia, called the decline in optimism among SMEs in the retail and food and beverage sector ""troubling"", noting it could point to how economic uncertainty has impacted consumer sentiment, affecting domestically-oriented sectors. He added that SMEs should adjust their strategies to ""future-proof themselves"", such as by embracing digital solutions to boost efficiencies or diversifying their target markets to improve competitiveness. SBF chief executive Ho Meng Kit said: ""Our SMEs are expecting a tighter credit environment which may impact cashflow.","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.825, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.9865}",0.9865
Pension funds and insurers pledge climate action at UN summit,Sep 23 2019,"UNITED NATIONS () - Insurers and pension funds managing US$2.3 trillion (S$3.1 trillion) pledged on Monday (Sept 23) to shift their portfolios away from carbon-heavy industries in the hope of triggering snowballing climate commitments from other big investors. German insurer Allianz, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), and Swedish pension fund Alecta were among the founders of the new ""Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance"" launched at a United Nations climate summit. ""Mitigating climate change is the challenge of our lifetime. Politics, business and societies across the globe need to act as one to rapidly reduce climate emissions,"" Mr Oliver Baete, chief executive of Allianz, said in a statement. As accelerating climate impacts become increasingly apparent via heatwaves, wildfires and receding coastlines, the financial sector is under growing pressure from activists, shareholders and regulators to respond. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who organised Monday's summit to try to boost stalling international efforts to control emissions, sees insurers and pensions funds as a crucial lever to wean the global economy off fossil fuels. These types of companies - called ""asset owners"" because they are the principal holders of retirement savings, or are investing customers' insurance premiums - represent some of the world's largest pools of capital. Members of the new grouping pledged to align their portfolios with a goal enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming to limit the increase in average temperatures to 1.5 deg C. The importance of this target was underscored late last year when a report by the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change spelt out the catastrophic consequences for people and nature if the world is allowed to get much hotter. Under current emissions pledges by governments, the Earth is on track for well over 3 deg C of warming by the end of the century - an outcome that scientists say could put the survival of modern industrial societies at risk. ""CalPERS recognises that climate change poses urgent and systemic risk, given our responsibility to protect our members' financial assets and provide the long-term returns that can pay pensions for this and coming generations,"" said Ms Marcie Frost, chief executive of CalPERS. The pension funds and insurers said they would rebalance their portfolios to ensure their investments were carbon neutral by 2050, with intermediate targets set for 2025, 2030 and 2040. They also pledged to make regular public progress reports. The nucleus of founding members hope they will influence an ever-growing proportion of the world's other big pension funds and insurers to push high-carbon companies towards more sustainable economic activities. But members of the new grouping said they might also have to divest from heavily polluting industries as a last resort if they proved unwilling to change their business models so they no longer pose a danger to the stability of the climate. Mr Michael Sabia, the chief executive of Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec (CDPQ), one of Canada's biggest pension funds, said there could be huge opportunities for investors willing to finance a fast transition to clean energy. ""There's a lot of people who don't get it, but I do think it's moving - the issue is whether it's moving fast enough,"" he told . ""It's speed that matters here."" The new coalition was organised by groups including the Geneva-based United Nations Environment Finance Initiative and Mission 2020, a network to spur faster climate action led by Ms Christiana Figueres, a former UN climate chief.","{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.891, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': 0.9637}",0.9637

Tax rate cut gives Modi sales pitch boost on US trip,Sep 22 2019,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in the United States yesterday for a seven-day visit, bringing to American investors the pitch that his country now boasts a corporate tax rate that is among the lowest in the world. Analysts say recent reforms will help attract foreign investment and improve business sentiment at a time of slowing growth in the South Asian country that early this year lost the title of fastest-growing economy to China. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had last Friday announced a slashing of the base corporate tax rate from 30 per cent to 22 per cent for all companies, in a move that saw the Sensex, the benchmark index of the Bombay Stock Exchange, climb 4.5 per cent. For manufacturing companies incorporated after Oct 1, the corporate tax rate was cut from 25 per cent to 15 per cent. The cuts put India among countries with a low corporate tax rate. The corporate tax rate in the US is 27 per cent, China 25 per cent, Malaysia 24 per cent and Singapore 17 per cent. Professor N. R. Bhanumurthy of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy in Delhi, said: ""It will help in reviving investment demand. More importantly, it should help in attracting foreign investment. Right now, the economy is slowing down at a much faster pace than the government expected. The slowdown is both cyclical and structural. This should help the structural component."" Mr Modi was scheduled to take part in a round-table meeting with chief executives of energy companies. He will address an Indian diaspora event called Howdy Modi today, joined by United States President Donald Trump. On Wednesday, he will deliver a keynote address at the plenary of the Bloomberg global business forum and participate in an investment round-table with over three dozen American corporate leaders. Mr Trump, who has called India ""tariff king"", removed the South Asian country in June from a list of beneficiary developing nations under the Generalised System of Preferences programme that allows duty-free entry for up to US$5.6 billion (S$7.7 billion) worth of its annual exports to the US. The issue of tariffs is expected to come up in talks. But the cut in corporate tax, experts said, has given Mr Modi a chance to sell India as an investment destination. ""The reduction in corporate taxes will bring long-term FDI (foreign direct investment) into the country as India is now one of the lowest corporate tax countries in Asia and it will help Mr Modi make a powerful pitch to long-term investors in the US to set up industry under Make In India,"" said Mr Rishi Sahai, managing director of Cogence Advisors, an investment bank. Make In India is a government initiative to push the Indian manufacturing industry. ""Even with an expected 5.5 per cent GDP (gross domestic product) growth in the current year, India is still the one bright spark for international investors in the global economy,"" added Mr Rishi. Besides the cut in corporate tax rates, the government has, over the past two weeks, also announced a series of measures to stimulate the economy. These included a rollback of super-rich surcharge, including for foreign portfolio investors, and a US$1.4 billion fund for stalled real estate projects. Business houses and corporate honchos welcomed the move, but also expressed hopes of further reforms.","{'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.894, 'pos': 0.076, 'compound': 0.962}",0.962
China must not resort to massive stimulus to deal with economic slowdown: Central Bank chief,Sep 24 2019,"BEIJING - China must not adopt a massive stimulus package to provide a boost to its softening economy, but instead focus on keeping debt levels sustainable and reducing costs for businesses, said its central bank chief on Tuesday (Sept 24).Tan Dawn Wei The economy is still on track and there is still ample room for policy manoeuvres, he added. China is in no rush to act, like some other countries which have adopted drastic quantitative easing policies or cutting interest rates, said Mr Yi Gang, governor of the People's Bank of China. ""Our monetary policy must remain prudent and this is the course we must continue to follow,"" he said at a news conference to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China next Tuesday (Oct 1). Despite China's growth hitting a new low in nearly three decades and  , Beijing has held back from rolling out a hefty stimulus programme, in favour of a more targeted approach, for fear of exacerbating debt risks. It has cut banks' reserve ratios, or the amount of cash banks have to hold as reserves, three times this year to inject more money into the economy. Other central banks have been more aggressive. The European Central Bank recently slashed interest rates to a record low and introduced a new round of quantitative easing while the US Federal Reserve cut rates twice this year.

Retail sales have also weakened in the latest round of economic data, prompting speculation that Beijing will have to resort to greater stimulus. State planner vice-chair Ning Jizhe told the news conference the government will try to maintain a steady economic growth by promoting investments and job creation, as well as encourage consumers to upgrade their purchases such as by easing restrictions on car-buying. Finance Minister Liu Kun, who was also at the same news conference, said tax cuts would also be bigger than expected this year, with manufacturers the main beneficiary.

Aesthetics doctor Georgia Lee made secret profits from minority shareholder's investment,Sep 24 2019,"SINGAPORE - Instead of using $2 million that an investor had injected into her skincare companies as working capital, aesthetics doctor Georgia Lee turned the funds into loans and secretly profited by earning interest on them.Selina Lum In a written judgment released on Tuesday (Sept 24), the High Court found that Dr Lee had put herself in a conflict of interest and breached her fiduciary duties to movie and TV producer Anita Hatta, who had invested the money in exchange for a 5 per cent stake in the skincare companies. However, the court dismissed Ms Hatta's claims that Dr Lee had misled her into investing the $2 million by painting a rosy picture of her skincare business, which in fact had been making losses. Ms Hatta  , that sales had exceeded $5 million, and that the companies were worth $40 million. Dr Lee denied making the representations. Justice Valerie Thean concluded that Dr Lee had only made the misrepresentation with regard to the amount she had invested. Regardless, the judge said Ms Hatta had not relied on any of the alleged misrepresentations in making the investment. The judge said Ms Hatta's failure to request financial documentation of any kind indicated that she was not concerned about the representations. Ms Hatta also did not ask any questions about the sales volume or value of the companies. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  But the judge ordered Dr Lee to buy out Ms Hatta's shares at a price to be determined by an independent valuer, as Dr Lee's breaches of her fiduciary duties by misusing the investment amounted to commercial unfairness. Ms Hatta, who has produced shows such as Asia's Next Top Model, filed a lawsuit in 2017 against Dr Lee, founder of aesthetic clinic TLC Lifestyle Practice, for misrepresentation and minority oppression. She sought either a return of her investment or a buyout of her shares in three companies set up by Dr Lee to package, market and sell her line of DrGL products. The companies are DRGL, DRGL Spa and Ciel. Ms Hatta's investment was carried out in a way that Dr Lee admitted in court was unnecessarily convoluted. Businessman Frank Cintamani, a friend of Dr Lee's, set up an events company with Ms Hatta called Fide Productions, which agreed to pay Dr Lee's companies $4 million for the exclusive rights to produce events for the DrGL brand. Ms Hatta said $2 million was her investment and the additional $2 million a separate loan she had extended to Fide. But Dr Lee said Ms Hatta wanted to invest $4 million in two tranches. Separately, three share transfer forms were signed, stating that Ms Hatta paid a total of $3 for 5 per cent of the shares in the companies. Ms Hatta's cheque for the investment was issued to Fide. Mr Cintamani later issued a cheque to Dr Lee from his personal account. Without Ms Hatta's knowledge, Dr Lee loaned the $2 million to DRGL and Ciel, charging interest. The agreements for two of the loans stated that the interest amounts were $240,000 and $100,000. Up till Jan 31, 2017, interest amounting to $90,000 and about $39,000 were paid by DRGL and Ciel respectively. Justice Thean said this put Dr Lee's personal financial interests and those of the companies in conflict. ""The $2m capital ought to have been injected directly into the companies... By imposing a loan, Dr Lee placed herself in a conflict of interest and the secret profit made thereby was in breach of her fiduciary duty,"" said the judge. Dr Lee had also used the companies, which were technically insolvent, to borrow money from finance companies in order to repay a $300,000 loan that TLC had extended to DRGL. She conceded that although the loan was stated to be interest-free, TLC received about $58,700 in interest payments from DRGL. ""She placed herself in a conflict of interest with the companies but did not disclose the profit she earned through interest payments,"" said the judge.

"Transcorp assessing going-concern ability after Fuji Xerox's claim, lapse of share placement",Sep 23 2019,"SINGAPORE - Catalist-listed Transcorp Holdings, which sells and rents cars, on Sunday (Sept 22) night announced that its board is assessing the group's ability to operate as a going concern, in light of a $48,736 claim it received from Fuji Xerox Singapore as well as the lapse of its proposed share placement. Transcorp had on July 20 proposed to raise $550,000 through a placement of 110 million new shares at the issue price of 0.5 cent apiece to two private investors. The completion of each placement agreement was conditional upon the fulfilment or waiver of certain conditions precedent. On Sunday, the company said the long-stop date for the agreements had lapsed, as the conditions precedent were not fulfilled or waived within 60 days. Transcorp and the placees will not proceed with the placement. Transcorp said its board continues to seek out and engage potential investors as part of its efforts to improve the company's cash flow and financial resources through third-party funding. The lapse of the placement agreements is not expected to have any material impact on Transcorp's consolidated net tangible assets (NTA) or earnings per share (EPS) for fiscal 2019 ending Oct 31. Separately, the company also received a writ of summons from Fuji Xerox Singapore for a claim of $48,736 in the State Courts of Singapore on Sept 9, in relation to rental arrangements for two photocopiers. The company said it is seeking legal advice on this matter, and is also investigating the circumstances surrounding the photocopiers' rental arrangements. The claim is not expected to have any material impact on the company's consolidated NTA or EPS for the fiscal year ending Oct 31, notwithstanding the lapse of the placement agreements, based on the group's latest audited financial statements for fiscal 2018 and the first half ended April 30, 2019. Transcorp's board is assessing the group's going concern basis premised on the successful raising of capital through corporate actions, as well as the follow-on business plans that will generate sufficient cash flows from the group's operating activities and financing plans, to allow the group to ramp up its operations and meet its obligations for the foreseeable future. The company said it will make announcements as and when there are material developments on potential investments and the Fuji Xerox claim. In the meantime, shareholders are advised to exercise caution when dealing with the company's securities. Transcorp requested a trading halt on Sept 19 before trading hours. Its shares last changed hands on Sept 10 at 0.4 cent. Transcorp had announced previously that it would have a going-concern issue if it did not manage to raise funds by the end of June. On July 9, it said it was in talks with various groups of investors. Transcorp also noted on July 9 that it had spoken to professional services firms on its winding up process in the worst case scenario, in the event that Transcorp is not able to successfully raise funds.","{'neg': 0.018, 'neu': 0.896, 'pos': 0.087, 'compound': 0.9785}",0.9785
Sia and Sound of Music: Hong Kong rallies showcase satirical remixes,Sep 23 2019,"HONG KONG (AFP) - The ever-evolving soundtrack to Hong Kong's summer of rage has been bolstered by three new songs that take satirical aim at the police - the most popular being a remix of Australian singer Sia's hit Chandelier. Hong Kong has been rocked for more than three months by huge and sometimes violent protests pushing for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability. The movement represents the biggest challenge to Beijing's rule since the international finance hub was handed back by Britain in 1997. Throughout the rallies, music has played a crucial role. In the early days, the Christian hymn Sing Hallelujah To The Lord and Do You Hear The People Sing? from the musical Les Miserables were the two most popular tunes sung by the defiant crowds. Then earlier this month,   went viral, and was chanted at flash mob gatherings in malls, from the tops of some of the city's best known peaks and at football matches. But the latest numbers to rise to the top of the protest charts are aimed at making people laugh - and skewering the city's police force who have become public enemy number one to those on the streets. Keep up with the latest in the region with the ST Asian Insider newsletter, delivered to your inbox every weekday By signing up, you agree to our   and  The most commonly heard song in recent days takes Sia's 2014 hit Chandelier, famous for its dramatic chorus, and replaces the lyrics with anti-police rhetoric. ""Bloody corrupt cops/Not responsible at all/Won't even try to improve,"" the chorus begins in Cantonese. ""Bloody corrupt cops, why?/How can they not apologise/Harming people's children."" The song is a vivid illustration of how Hong Kong's online community plays a huge role both in organising the largely leaderless protests and the meme-heavy culture behind them. The Sia remix began life with an emotional and fiery speech in support of the police by Maria Cordero, a singer, actress and chef originally from Macau who is dubbed ""Fat Mama"" by her fans. The speech was given in July to a large pro-police rally, part of a series of rallies by government loyalists where pro-China celebrities have been used to bolster support. The Cordero speech was widely shared among both democracy protesters and police supporters. But in recent weeks an anonymous person remixed her words to make it sound like she was condemning the police and then used auto-tuning software to bend her pitch to Sia's Chandelier. The track dropped online and an instant hit was born. At recent rallies the song - titled Fat Mama Has Something To Say - has become a new rallying cry, shouted at police by largely young crowds of masked protesters before inevitable clashes. Another track that has proved popular uses the tune from The Sound of Music's Do-Re-Mi. Sung in English, the lyrics take a popular protest slogan that is chanted on the streets and sprayed on walls. ""If we burn, you burn with us/Burn the popo (police) into dust/If we burn, you burn with us/Burn Chinazi until bust."" The third song is sung to the tune of the traditional English nursery rhyme London Bridge Is Falling Down and is particularly insulting towards the police, describing them as ""dogs who beg"" and ""chickens who want to be hawks"". Hong Kong's protests were ignited by a now-abandoned plan to allow extraditions to mainland China. But after Beijing and city leaders took a hard line, the movement snowballed into a much wider expression of rage at the local government and life under Chinese rule.

Three radicalised Indonesian maids detained under Internal Security Act,Sep 23 2019,"SINGAPORE - Three Indonesian domestic workers have been issued detention orders under the Internal Security Act and are being investigated for financing terrorism.Linette Lai They are Anindia Afiyantari, 33, Retno Hernayani, 36, and Turmini, 31. All three had been working in Singapore for between six and 13 years at the point of their arrest, said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in a statement on Monday afternoon (Sept 23). They are the first foreign domestic workers to be issued such detention orders. A fourth maid was also arrested as part of the investigation. Although she did not subscribe to these radical beliefs, she was aware that the others had been radicalised and did not report them. She has since been repatriated to Indonesia, the MHA said. The three maids became radicalised last year after viewing online material on terror group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Their convictions deepened after they joined multiple pro-ISIS social media chat groups and channels. Subsequently, they set up multiple social media accounts to post pro-ISIS material. ""The three of them actively galvanised support online for ISIS,"" the ministry said. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  ""They also donated funds to overseas-based entities for terrorism-related purposes, such as to support the activities of ISIS and JAD,"" it added. The three also became strong supporters of terrorist group Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), an Indonesia-based ISIS affiliate that has been banned by Jakarta. The MHA said the domestic helpers were initially drawn to the violent visuals disseminated on pro-ISIS platforms. These included bomb attacks and beheading videos by the terrorist group, as well as ""recycled propaganda"" on its past battlefield victories. It added that they were also influenced by online sermons from radical Indonesian preachers such as Aman Abdurrahman and Usman Haidar bin Seff. Aman was the de facto leader of JAD, and was sentenced to death in June last year for inciting others to commit terrorist attacks in Indonesia. JAD was responsible for several recent terrorist attacks and foiled plots, including the 2018 Surabaya suicide bombings. Meanwhile, Usman was a member of regional terrorist group Jemaah Islamiah (JI), and was sentenced to three years' jail in 2004 for harbouring a senior JI member following the 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing in Jakarta. In January, he uploaded several videos calling for the release of jailed JI founder and radical preacher, Abu Bakar Bashir. The MHA said the three maids became acquainted with one another around the time that they became radicalised. Anindia and Retno first met at a social gathering in Singapore, while Turmini connected with them on social media. Over time, they developed a network of pro-militant foreign online contacts. These included online ""boyfriends"" who shared their ideology. Anindia and Retno both intended to travel to Syria to join ISIS. Anindia was prepared to become a suicide bomber. Retno aspired to live among ISIS fighters in Syria and believed that Muslims were duty-bound to travel to conflict zones outside Syria - such as Palestine and Kashmir - to fight against ""the enemies of Islam"". Their online contacts also encouraged them to join pro-ISIS groups in southern Philippines, Afghanistan or Africa. All three women also donated funds to overseas groups for terrorism-related purposes, and Turmini believed that doing so would earn her a place in paradise. Singapore has identified a total of 19 radicalised foreign domestic workers since 2015. All have been repatriated apart from Anindia, Retno and Turmini, who are still being investigated. ""None were found to have had plans to carry out acts of violence in Singapore, but their radicalisation and association with terrorists overseas had rendered them a security threat to Singapore,"" the MHA said. It added that Singapore faces a persistent terrorist threat, fuelled by propaganda from groups like ISIS. ""The fact that all three individuals in the present case were radicalised in 2018, at a time when ISIS' physical territory was already significantly diminished, highlights the enduring appeal of ISIS' violent ideology,"" it said. The MHA also said that the Government takes a serious view of any form of support for terrorism here, whether by Singaporeans or foreigners. It urged the public to exercise caution when viewing radical material online, including sermons by extremist preachers. People should report possible signs of radicalisation in friends, colleagues or family members as soon as possible, the ministry added.

"Singapore banks' South, South-east Asia exposure raises risks: Fitch Ratings",Sep 23 2019,"SINGAPORE - When it comes to risks from markets outside Singapore, the Republic's three major banks DBS, UOB and OCBC experienced more asset-quality issues in South and South-east Asia. This is compared with other regions like China or the rest of the world, a new Fitch Ratings report has found. The global credit rating agency on Monday added that this is ""not surprising"" as these regions felt more volatility than other regions in the past decade. This included a fallout in the oil and gas sector which saw banks' loan quality taking a step back in 2015 to 2017. Examples include DBS being affected by its India middle market portfolio which declined in 2013 to 2014, and UOB classifying some of its shipping accounts as impaired loans. Although Singapore banks have since introduced enhancements to their credit assessment and monitoring following these incidences, Fitch Ratings said it ""remains to be seen"" how this would minimise credit quality slippage in certain events. These events include economic deterioration in key jurisdictions or another commodities sector downturn such as in coal, crude palm oil or oil and gas. That being said, the credit ratings agency believes Singapore banks will focus on organic growth in the region, although it does not rule out the possibility of an acquisition should the opportunity arise. ""We believe acquisitions are likely to be moderate rather than franchise-transforming undertakings. We expect the banks to remain disciplined and maintain sound financial buffers,"" the report added. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  When it comes to the China market, the report said the banks' loan quality in this region has been ""generally sound"" with impaired loan ratio ranging from 0.2 per cent to 1.4 per cent in the last decade. ""Fitch believes the underlying loan quality has yet to be fully tested in a broad downturn, while the exposure has increased in size,"" the ratings agency added. Singapore banks' China risk appetite lies mainly in targeting top-tier and ""systemically important"" state-owned enterprises, as well as large local and foreign corporations - which include large and well-capitalised Singapore corporations operating in China. A large chunk of the banks' exposure in China is short-term trade loans, which generally bear low risk, the report said. As for the rest of the world, the underlying exposure of Singapore banks has ""likely changed"" since the large corporate defaults seen from 2009 to 2012. This saw DBS being hit by Dubai-linked entities in 2009, and UOB impacted by a large transportation-related account in Australia. The change has likely come from banks focusing on financing investment flows to and from developed markets, through global investment and property funds, along with multinational corporations. These loans are also denominated mainly in US dollars. Fitch Ratings said the credit strength of these loans are likely to be ""robust and most likely to be tested in the event of economic stress"". This was after growing at a rapid 15 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over 2014 to the first half of 2019 - although off a small base compared with the banks' South-east Asia and China exposures. Credit risk is further allayed by hard asset collateralisation, however, valuations of these assets could be dented in a sharp property market downturn, Fitch added. Fitch Ratings said it regards the overseas operating environments of the three major local banks to be of higher risk than that of Singapore. Thus, a downward adjustment of its operating environment assessment of DBS, UOB and OCBC may be triggered by a ""meaningful and sustained increase in exposure"" to these volatile markets. ""This would increase the likelihood of negative rating action, unless mitigated by stronger loss-absorption buffers,"" Fitch Ratings said, adding that positive rating action is ""improbable"", as the ratings are already ""among the highest"" of banks rated by Fitch globally. Fitch Ratings had revised its outlook on the operating environment (OE) of the three major banks from ""negative"" to ""stable"" on May 7. The midpoint - kept unchanged - was consistent with the implied 'aa' category OE score, and was supported by Singapore's high GDP (gross domestic product) per capita and 2018 99.5 percentile ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business index. However, the implied score does not take into account the banks' rising exposure in the region. ""We would therefore assess the score at 'aa-'/Stable for banks whose operations are concentrated mainly in Singapore. Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore) at 'A/Stable/a' is one case in point,"" it added. The revision to the OE outlook captured the banks' increasing exposure to lower-rated jurisdictions in the faster-growing, but higher-risk emerging markets of China, and South and South-east Asia.

US senator Mark Warner urges international partnership to counter China,Sep 24 2019,"WASHINGTON - Left unopposed, China's threat to global norms and values jeopardises not just America's position in the world, but risks undermining the free inquiry, free travel, free enterprise and other values that have animated decades of global stability and prosperity, Senator Mark Warner told an audience in Washington on Monday (Sept 23).Nirmal Ghosh But he added that he was ""deeply concerned by the Trump administration's erratic and incoherent approach” - and warned against a new Cold War.  The Democrat Senator from Virginia is a leading China hawk. He is vice chair of the Senate's Select Committee on Intelligence, and also sits on committees on International Trade, Customs, and Global Competitiveness, and National Security and International Trade and Finance. He has co-authored legislation targeting China, including, in January, a Bill that would establish an Office of Critical Technologies at the White House, responsible for developing a strategy to protect against state sponsored threats to critical American supply chains and technologies. Also last year, the Senator supported banning the use of components from Chinese companies ZTE and Huawei in government systems. The Trump administration's unilateral approach to the challenge was not producing success, he said in the talk at the US Institute for Peace (USIP), a think tank.    China posed a challenge not just to the US or the West, but to “all nations committed to democracy, individual liberty, an independent judiciary, and the rule of law,” he said. “Countries like Japan, South Korea, Australia, India, and others… we all face these same challenges.” “Yet rather than building a coalition to confront this shared issues, President Trump has alienated our closest allies,” he said. “Instead of building a values-based international coalition to stand up to China, the President has minimised the importance of human rights and representative Government.” “The President's insistence on framing this as a conflict between our two countries has resulted in little tangible gain,” Mr Warner said. “We cannot afford to frame this strategic challenge in simplistic, Cold War terms — dividing the world in two and fighting for a bigger half.” China's economic integration meant it was the top trading partner for more than two-thirds of the world, he said, warning that “The stakes are too high for each country to simply retreat into its own corner.""  Yet the US needed to secure supply chains, especially for military platforms and equipment, he said, pointing to another Bill that would establish a National Supply Chain Security Center in the office of the Director of National Intelligence. “We should get serious about securing our telecommunications systems, especially when it comes to 5G. That means relying on trusted companies to build our telecommunication infrastructure, and it means setting standards that adhere to our democratic values,” he said. “Another item I am working on is much-needed beneficial ownership legislation, so that the Chinese government and other bad actors cannot hide investments in anonymous shell Companies,” he said, adding that there should be “clear consequences for American companies and citizens that enable China's bad behaviour.” “I've become increasingly disturbed that the U.S. business and academic community has deepened partnerships with China to gain short-term market opportunities,” he said.  “Equally troubling, we've seen American investors pour money into Chinese companies that advance the PRC's military capabilities. We've also seen American companies develop technologies that directly enable the censorship, surveillance, and social control efforts of China and other authoritarian regimes.” “These efforts may be good for business, but they directly support China's efforts to rewrite global norms and rules,” he warned. American should take the China threat as a wake-up call, he said. “As we look ahead to the technologies of the future, we need to step up our commitment to funding scientific research if we hope to compete in the decades ahead.” “Our defense budgets need to better align with the fact that the “battlefield” might not be the South China Sea,” the Senator argued. ""It could be the networks behind our power grid or our financial sector."" ""We are investing in the best 20th century military money can buy, when much of our conflict will happen in 21st century domains like cyber, space, and misinformation (and) disinformation. And in many of these areas, such as satellites, China is rapidly becoming our peer.” Where the Trump administration has got it wrong, he said, was to underestimate the importance of partners in advancing the US's most fundamental interests. “Our efforts to convince allies to adopt alternatives to Huawei have been constantly undermined — particularly when the President keeps hinting that restrictions on Huawei could be a bargaining chip in the context of a wider trade deal,” he said. “We should instead be working closely with our allies and partners to create a market for competitors to Huawei that abide by basic security and privacy standards,” he said. “(And) we should be coordinating with our allies on export controls and the screening of foreign investment… and coordinating with our allies to research and innovate together.” On security, he said the US must deepen cooperation with allies and partners like South Korea, Japan, Australia, and India, and expand its network of alliances in the interest of a free and open Indo-Pacific. He added : “As co-chair of the India Caucus, I see real opportunities to increase our engagement with India on a set of shared strategic interests, such as maritime cooperation, cybersecurity and counterpiracy.” ","{'neg': 0.086, 'neu': 0.746, 'pos': 0.168, 'compound': 0.998}",0.998

He was speaking to The Straits Times after the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) announced that three radicalised Indonesian maids had been issued detention orders under the Internal Security Act while investigations into their terror financing activities are ongoing. They had actively galvanised support online for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and donated funds to overseas-based entities for terrorism-related purposes. Dr Noor Huda said many terrorist groups hook new members by initially appearing to espouse mainstream versions of Islam and offering recruits a sense of belonging.

Grab and Tesla cabs head for face-off in Indonesia taxi war,Sep 24 2019,"JAKARTA • In 2015, the shares of Indonesia's largest cab company were soaring, while its revenue reached a record high. Then came Uber, followed by Grab and Gojek, South-east Asia's answers to the revolutionary ride-hailing app. Competition from the technology titans wiped out US$1.7 billion (S$2.3 billion), or almost 80 per cent, of Blue Bird's market value from a peak. Revenue plunged 23 per cent in three years and the latest quarterly earnings fell to a record low. But rather than give up, the 54-year-old cab operator is seeking to turn the tide. Leading the effort is Ms Noni Purnomo, who succeeded her father in May as president. Four months into her new job at the Jakarta-based company, Ms Purnomo is banking on technology to transform the flagging business her late grandmother started in 1965. Her plans include focusing on electric vehicles (EVs) made by Tesla and BYD to cut fleet ownership costs and improve efficiency using data. ""We decided to take a huge leap,"" Ms Purnomo, 47, said at her office in Jakarta last week. ""With this leap, we hope we can address our shortcomings"" and catch up with rivals. While sustainability is her immediate priority, Ms Purnomo's goal eventually is to beat the ride-hailing giants that have upended what was once an industry renowned for its steady revenue and dominated by small owners and families like Ms Purnomo's. She is up against Singapore-based Grab, the regional giant that bought Uber's South-east Asian operations last year. Ms Purnomo's toughest challenge yet may be to convince investors that her company is here to stay and thrive. Blue Bird's shares traded at 2,590 rupiah in Jakarta on Friday. They reached an all-time high of 12,500 rupiah in January 2015, months after Blue Bird raised a modest US$200 million from an initial public offering. Ms Purnomo has already added about two dozen EVs to Blue Bird's almost 30,000-strong fleet of cabs that operate in the cities of Java, Sumatra, Bali, Lombok and Batam. Eventually, the plan is to have 2,000 of the zero-emission taxis from Tesla and Chinese maker BYD, she said. GEARING UP FOR COMPETITION ANALYST KENNY LIEW, at Fitch Solutions. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  EVs may give her company an edge as initial data has shown encouraging signs, she said. The vehicles cost 40 per cent less to operate than fossil fuel-powered cars, and generate 30 per cent more revenue, according to her. Besides, her rivals cannot replicate this model easily, she said. Their asset-light model would require drivers to bear the financing costs of an expensive EV, a risky proposition for most individuals, she added. (A representative for Grab did not respond to a request for comments.) ""We have a different business model and the company can take the risk instead of the individual,"" Ms Purnomo said. The lack of charging infrastructure in the South-east Asian country could pose a hurdle. Right now, Blue Bird has facilities at its main office in Jakarta, while there is one available at the city's airport. President Joko Widodo's government is trying to ramp up charging stations in malls and other public places to help boost sales of EVs. Blue Bird will also invest in the Internet of Things - an emerging technology that links machines and gadgets and likely to get a boost with the roll-out of 5G wireless networks. IoT will help Blue Bird collect data and improve operational efficiency and help implement dynamic pricing, a variable fare model popular with the likes of Uber, Lyft and Grab. Ms Purnomo said the company now has the technical capability to fight back and the financial resources to challenge them, without elaborating on how she plans to raise capital. On the other hand, Grab has money to burn. Valued at US$14 billion, it is planning to raise more than US$4.5 billion in its latest funding round. ""Gojek and Grab's low fares have caused a major churn for these taxi companies,"" said Fitch Solutions analyst Kenny Liew. ""The taxi companies need to look at new business models, even partnerships with ride-hailing players, to stay relevant."" Blue Bird already has an alliance with Gojek that allows its fleet to be available on the Gojek app. While it opens up the customer base, it also has the disadvantage of lower margins, Mr Liew said. Gojek offers both motorcycle and cab rides. A representative for Gojek said the company has also started a pilot project for electric motorcycles and cars in Indonesia. If the vehicles can save costs, that will help drivers, she said in an e-mail. Ms Purnomo started working at Blue Bird in the mid-1990s. Groomed by her father for a key role in the family business, the engineering graduate held positions in maintenance, customer service and sales before taking a break to finish her master's in business administration at the University of San Francisco. Competition brought about by ride-hailing companies in the traditional taxi business is ""nearing equilibrium"", Ms Purnomo said, adding that some customers and even drivers who previously left Blue Bird to try out at rivals have returned. While investors have pummelled Blue Bird's shares, analysts have been more optimistic. All six tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying it. ""The worst appears to be behind them,"" said Sinarmas Sekuritas analyst Richard Suherman. ""Their transformation, including their plan to build up a better technology platform and dynamic pricing, should help their competitiveness and profitability.""

3 radicalised Indonesian maids detained under ISA,Sep 24 2019,"Three Indonesian maids have been issued detention orders under the Internal Security Act (ISA) and are being investigated for financing terrorism.Linette Lai They are Anindia Afiyantari, 33, Retno Hernayani, 36, and Turmini, 31. The three had been working in Singapore for between six and 13 years at the point of their arrests, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said in a statement yesterday. These are the first foreign domestic workers to be issued such detention orders. A fourth maid was also arrested as part of the investigation. Although she did not subscribe to these radical beliefs, she was aware that the others had been radicalised and did not report them. She has since been repatriated to Indonesia, MHA said. The three maids, who were arrested in August, had become radicalised last year after viewing material online on terror group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Their convictions deepened after they joined pro-ISIS social media chat groups and channels. Subsequently, they set up multiple social media accounts to post pro-ISIS material and donated funds to groups such as ISIS and Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), the ministry added. JAD is an Indonesia-based ISIS affiliate that has been banned by Jakarta. MHA said the three women were initially drawn to the violent visuals disseminated on pro-ISIS platforms. These included bomb attacks and beheading videos by the group, as well as propaganda on its past battlefield victories. The three were also influenced by online sermons from radical Indonesian preachers such as Aman Abdurrahman and Usman Haidar Seff. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  Aman was the de facto leader of JAD, and was sentenced to death last June for inciting others to commit terrorist attacks in Indo-nesia. JAD was responsible for several recent terrorist attacks and foiled plots, including last year's Surabaya suicide bombings. Usman was a member of regional terrorist group Jemaah Islamiah (JI), and was sentenced to three years in jail in 2004 for harbou-ring a senior JI member following the 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing in Jakarta. MHA said the three maids became acquainted with one ano-ther around the time that they became radicalised. Anindia and Retno first met at a social gathering in Singapore, while Turmini connected with them on social media. They developed a network of pro-militant foreign online contacts. These included online ""boyfriends"" who shared their ideology. Anindia and Retno both intended to travel to Syria to join ISIS, and Anindia was prepared to become a suicide bomber. All three women also donated funds to overseas groups for terrorism-related purposes, and Turmini believed that doing so would earn her a place in paradise. Singapore has identified a total of 19 radicalised foreign domestic workers since 2015. All have been repatriated apart from Anindia, Retno and Turmini, who are still being investigated. ""None was found to have had plans to carry out acts of violence in Singapore, but their radicalisation and association with terrorists overseas had rendered them a security threat to Singapore,"" MHA said. It added: ""The fact that all three individuals in the present case were radicalised in 2018, at a time when ISIS' physical territory was already significantly diminished, highlights the enduring appeal of ISIS' violent ideology.""

Grab contributed $8b to South-east Asia economy in a year,Sep 24 2019,"SINGAPORE - Grab said it contributed US$5.8 billion (S$8 billion) to South-east Asia's economy in the 12 months leading up to March 2019, through driver, delivery, merchant and agent incomes and sales generated through its platform and Grab unit Kudo. In its inaugural social impact report released on Tuesday (Sept 24), Grab said that there were about nine million micro-entrepreneurs on its platform as at Aug 31 this year. That means one in 70 South-east Asians have earned an income through the Grab platform. Just a year and a half ago, the number of micro-entrepreneurs on the platform was 2.6 million, according to data as at March 2018. Grab, which offers financial products through its unit Grab Financial, also estimates that one in four drivers who have received financing products from the group would have been turned down by traditional banks. Reasons for rejection include failing to meet an income threshold and the lack of supporting documents. Independent consultancy firm Dalberg advised the methodology for analyses on key social impact metrics in the report, while Grab's financial statement auditor KPMG independently verified the social-economic calculation based on agreed upon procedures. At its social impact conference in Jakarta, Grab announced three goals to be achieved by 2025 under its ""Grab for Good"" programme. The company wants to bring digital literacy and greater inclusion to three million South-east Asians through partnerships with governments, private companies and non-profit organisations. The three million comprise micro-entrepreneurs with Grab. The firm also aims to help over five million more traditional businesses and small merchants to digitise their workflow and processes.

"Capability of firms, workers can buffer against present economic challenges: DPM Heng",Sep 24 2019,"SINGAPORE - Singapore is vulnerable to uncertainties in the global environment and its buffer against present headwinds are companies and workers' capabilities, which will enable it to ride the eventual upturn, said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Tuesday (Sept 24).Seow Bei Yi ""But capabilities can only be built if we have strong partners who have confidence in us, and who are willing to stick with us through business cycles,"" he added at the Distinguished Partner in Progress Award ceremony at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. Companies such as US firm Applied Materials, which supplies equipment and software for the manufacturing of semiconductor chips, is one such example. Its commitment here is a ""vote of confidence in Singapore"", said Mr Heng, who conferred this year's award to the firm. It has invested over $100 million here over the past decade. The award, which was last given out in 2016, recognises companies that have contributed significantly to Singapore's economic growth, and promoted the country's interest in the social and community arena. This is at least the third time in over a month that Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, is shoring up confidence in the Republic's semiconductor sector, as   by trade war worries, lower demand and slowing economic growth.

By signing up, you agree to our   and  ""We were able to achieve this, because world-leading semiconductor equipment original equipment manufacturers have built up a significant presence in Singapore,"" said Mr Heng, adding that Applied Materials stands out among them. About half of the company's global semiconductor equipment is manufactured in Singapore. It is also the single largest employer in the semiconductor equipment industry here, accounting for over 10 per cent of a 9,000 workforce. Meanwhile, the overall semiconductor industry makes up about 7 per cent of Singapore's economy, accounting for 11 per cent of global market share. But business sentiment in the manufacturing sector has taken a hit in recent months amid expectations of a prolonged trade war, with firms in the semiconductor industry saying they are freezing headcount. On Tuesday, Mr Heng urged companies here to tap programmes that help them deepen industry partnerships, noting that Applied Materials has worked with both small and medium-sized enterprises and public research institutions. These have helped boost local capabilities. ""Building win-win partnerships with world-leading companies, such as Applied Materials, is how we have grown our semiconductor industry,"" he said. He stressed that manufacturing remains a key pillar of the economy, with advanced manufacturing critical to the sector's transformation and productivity growth. To this end, the Government has committed $19 billion over five years  , which includes advanced manufacturing as a key thrust. It is in the early stages of working on a new plan for the five years after 2020. With Applied Materials planning to transform its facility at Changi into a smart factory, marking its first dedicated advanced manufacturing initiative, Mr Heng said he hopes its lessons can be scaled globally and that other companies can take on similar moves. Past winners of the award include medical technology firm Becton, Dickinson in 2016. It had been in Singapore for three decades and sited its regional headquarters here, along with its largest manufacturing site and research hub in Greater Asia. The Economic Development Board, which administers the award, said Applied Materials' support and partnership continue to create good business and job opportunities here. At the event, EDB chairman Beh Swan Gin outlined Applied Materials' growth in Singapore, from its set-up in 1991 to the opening of its US$60 million (S$82.6 million) Singapore operations centre in 2010. This is its largest manufacturing facility outside of the United States, supported by close to 50 suppliers, both foreign and local. ""I believe the close partnerships with the supplier ecosystem is one of the contributing factors to Applied Materials' continuing growth in Singapore,"" he said. Dr Beh added that at least five new products from the company's etch and deposition product lines were designed and developed from Singapore, showing the value public research players bring to industry, and the importance of partnerships. Applied Materials' chief executive and president Gary Dickerson said its relationship with Singapore is at the foundation of future infrastructure for the data economy – which some say will create over US$10 trillion in economic value. Beyond manufacturing, new areas for collaboration could include life sciences, he said. He added that the safe environment and access to talent here make it among the best places for collaboration.

Criminal probe opens into Credit Suisse allegedly hiring private detectives to shadow ex-star banker ,Sep 24 2019,"ZURICH () - Prosecutors have opened a criminal probe into an incident in which Credit Suisse allegedly hired private detectives to shadow the Swiss bank's ex-wealth management head, Iqbal Khan, the Zurich attorney's office said on Monday (Sept 23). Khan, a rising star in Swiss finance, is moving to rival bank UBS to head its wealth management unit in October, just three months after  .

Asian states urged to promote regional trade liberalisation,Sep 22 2019,"Former Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan slammed protectionism and called on Asian countries to work together towards regional trade liberalisation and to push for World Trade Organisation (WTO) reform to better protect developing countries.Goh Sui Noi Dr Zhou, who was speaking at the Singapore Summit yesterday, did not refer to the United States by name but pointed out that trade disputes ""are seriously threatening global trade and economic growth"". He added that trade sanctions ""imposed unilaterally by one WTO member against others"" have seriously undermined the authority and efficacy of the world body. ""As beneficiaries, developers and contributors to the international trade rules and the global monetary and financial order, Asian countries may take concerted actions."" These included building a stronger WTO to keep abreast of the times, Dr Zhou said. He added: ""WTO rules fall short of addressing challenges of the 21st century concerning economic globalisation. They have also been inadequate in terms of protecting the interests of developing countries, especially those that are relatively impoverished."" While the best choice is to have full global multilateral rules, if this is not possible because of friction, ""we can have a smaller scope of global multilateral rules"", he said. If such a global trade regime were to cover five billion or six billion of the world's population of 7.5 billion, ""it's still a large system and still a very good choice"", he said. ASIA MUST ACT IN UNISON DR ZHOU XIAOCHUAN, former Chinese central bank governor, on how Asia must push for World Trade Organisation reform. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which brings together Asean and six other countries, and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which gathers 11 Asia-Pacific countries, can together form a regional multilateral trade and investment group. It could expand to include Europe and Africa to enhance trade and economic efficiency and investment opportunity. Asked about calls from the US for China to open up its financial markets and better protect intellectual property rights, Dr Zhou said China would deepen these reforms because of internal needs, not outside pressure. At the same time, China is deeply involved in the global economy and needs to consider international rules, just as its sports teams need to play by international rules when taking part in competitions even if they think these rules are not optimal, he said. China needs to examine what kind of reform it needs to implement to participate deeper in the global economy, he said. Dr Zhou added that the tech war between China and the US is a ""more serious matter"" than global rules for trade, but noted 80 per cent of technology is tradable and can be acquired by investment. ""You can buy the patents, pay for user licences, invest in R&D and buy companies that have specialist technology,"" he noted. Given China's ability to do all these now and that there are many academic conferences and publications, ""it's a little bit naive to think that the blockage of technology exchange and technology transfer can be effective"", Dr Zhou said. The annual summit brings together business and thought leaders from Asia and around the world to discuss global trends in business, finance and geopolitics. Among the challenges facing Asia that were discussed was the decoupling of the US and Chinese economies that is spilling over into geopolitics and could lead to two overlapping geopolitical orders. This is not what people want as the consequences will be that the conditions that have made ""this fantastic growth"" in Asia possible over the last few decades are going to be affected, noted Mr Shivshankar Menon, a former national security adviser of India. However, he is not entirely pessimistic, saying that there would not be another Cold War and that there was a limit to decoupling.","{'neg': 0.059, 'neu': 0.819, 'pos': 0.122, 'compound': 0.9923}",0.9923
"Umno, PAS talk up pro-Malay economic plan after unity pact",Sep 22 2019,"Leaders from Malaysia's two biggest parties yesterday stressed the need to continue affirmative action for the Malay Muslim majority, claiming the community is still worse off than its fellow citizens. Sworn enemies for decades, leaders from the Malay nationalist party Umno and Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS), along with hundreds of their supporters, sat side by side at a forum, as they discussed the New Economic Policy (NEP) - a race-based policy that has grown contentious but which the two parties broadly agree upon. Fresh from signing a political unity pact just a week ago at Umno headquarters where the forum was also held, the two new allies put their best arguments forward to woo more Malays against pronouncements by the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government to dismantle the NEP. Umno and PAS, which together attracted 75 per cent of the Malay vote in the general election in May last year, are banking on their formal pact to win the next polls that must be held by 2023. Speakers at the forum, Challenges of the New Economic Policy in Malaysia Baru, argued that while the pro-Malay restructuring of Malaysia's economy under the NEP had weaknesses, it simply needed to be updated for the present context. ""Bumiputeras must still be given advantages, not because of inequality, but because it is due from the Constitution,"" said PAS vice-president Samsuri Mokhtar, who is also Terengganu Chief Minister. Bumiputeras refer to Malays and other indigenous races in Malaysia. The NEP was introduced in 1970 - a year after deadly race riots followed an electoral setback for the Umno-led government. Although planned to last 20 years, much of the pro-Malay quotas and privileges in business, education and property ownership have remained in place. Keep up with the latest in the region with the ST Asian Insider newsletter, delivered to your inbox every weekday By signing up, you agree to our   and  Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who also led the country from 1981 to 2003, has said the NEP had failed to uplift the Malays despite the abundant opportunities offered to them. But former finance minister Johari Abdul Ghani, who is from Umno, said yesterday that the policy's failure to create capable Malay entrepreneurs was due to a rush to meet the 30:40:30 equity target among bumiputeras, other Malaysians and foreigners, respectively, in only two decades. The result, he said, was widespread ""Alibaba"" practices, where a government project won by a Malay company was contracted out to a firm owned by Chinese Malaysians who would carry out the project. Ethnic Chinese still dominate Malaysia's marketplace. Today, Malay equity in business is estimated at 23 per cent, with calls by PH politicians for the government to move to needs-based measures, rather than race-based affirmative action. Former Selangor Menteri Besar Khalid Ibrahim, who began supporting Umno and PAS after he was removed from his post in 2014 by Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim's Parti Keadilan Rakyat, pointed out that the NEP's main success was poverty eradication. Nearly two-thirds of Malays were poor in 1970, compared with a quarter of Chinese, but the figures dropped to less than 21 per cent and 6 per cent respectively in 1990, he said. ""NEP debates centre too much on equity and quotas. It was about sharing a growing cake and not just redistribution,"" Tan Sri Khalid said. Despite the collective support for pro-Malay measures, some in the audience were unconvinced that Umno and PAS have a concrete plan to improve their lot. ""We want to know what PAS and Umno can do for the grassroots, not just theories,"" said Mr Azizan Taib, 66, from Perak. ""We should refer back to Islamic economic policies like Islamic banking, which Malays favour."" Datuk Seri Samsuri promised the two parties would formulate substantive policies ahead of the next election. ""Our experts can put forward a game-changing policy. With the two biggest parties in the country, we will have a far better policy than the current government."" The Mahathir administration has responded to economic anxiety, especially from Malays, by unveiling a 10-year Shared Prosperity vision. As of 2016, bumiputera households continue to earn less than other Malaysians, making an average RM6,300 (S$2,080) monthly, compared with RM8,750 for the Chinese.

Trump calls China 'threat to the world' ahead of trade talks,Sep 22 2019,"WASHINGTON • US President Donald Trump has said that China is a ""threat to the world"" and suggests that Beijing is eager to make a trade deal because his tariffs are hurting the Chinese economy, coarsening his tone as the two countries prepare to resume negotiations. The Trump administration has closely tied economic policy and national security and, in remarks at the White House last Friday, Mr Trump said China is using money pilfered from the United States through unfair trade practices to build up its military. The comments came as mid-level officials from both countries wrapped up talks in Washington last week - which the Xinhua news agency yesterday called ""constructive"" - ahead of a planned meeting between senior trade negotiators next month. ""Obviously, China is a threat to the world in a sense, because they're building a military faster than anybody,"" Mr Trump said. ""I view China in many different ways. But, right now, I'm thinking about trade. But, you know, trade equals military."" Mr Trump also tried to put to rest speculation that he might settle for an interim deal to give markets a lift ahead of the presidential election next year. ""I'm looking for a complete deal, I'm not looking for a partial deal,"" Mr Trump said during a joint news conference with Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia. ""We're looking for the big deal."" Mr Trump has imposed tariffs on US$360 billion (S$495 billion) worth of Chinese goods and plans to tax nearly all imports from China by the end of the year. WRONG RATIONALE MR CUI TIANKAI, China's ambassador to the United States. He said that the tariffs have not had an impact on the US economy, despite vocal complaints from American businesses, who say their costs are going up and their supply chains are being disrupted. Many of those businesses have applied to the US Trade Representative for relief from the tariffs and, last Friday, the administration excluded hundreds of products from being taxed. Despite Mr Trump's renewed criticism of China, the two countries have been taking steps to ease tension in recent weeks as they try to resolve a dispute that has cast a cloud over the global economy. China has recently allowed its companies to resume purchases of some American farm products after Mr Trump agreed to delay increasing tariffs on another batch of Chinese imports by two weeks, to Oct 15. As part of a deal, China wants the US to roll back the tariffs that it imposed and lift restrictions on American companies doing business with Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant. In addition to buying more American agricultural products, the US wants China to make sweeping changes to its industrial policy, protect American intellectual property and open its market to American businesses. But it remains evident that mending the relationship between the US and China will not happen easily. Sources familiar with the just-ended two-day talks in Washington said that the Chinese delegation's leader, Vice-Finance Minister Liao Min, laid out China's demands that any deal must remove all US tariffs and be balanced so that it is not all concessions from Beijing and none from Washington. During a speech in New York last week, Mr Cui Tiankai, China's ambassador to America, squarely blamed the US for the trade war. ""The trade war the US launched and repeatedly escalated was based on a wrong rationale in the very beginning, and its negative impact has now hit both countries and spilled over to the whole world,"" he said. A Chinese delegation, led by Minister for Agriculture Han Changfu, was planning to visit farms in Montana tomorrow and Tuesday. But, last Friday morning, the Montana Farm Bureau was alerted that the visit had been cancelled because the group had to return early to China, according to Mr Scott Kulbeck, director of membership development at the bureau. Last Friday, Mr Trump insisted that even though the relationship between the US and China has soured on his watch, he continues to have fond feelings for China's leader Xi Jinping. ""My relationship with President Xi is a very amazing one, very good one,"" he said. ""But we have, right now, a little spat.""

Tackling ageing issues: Turning silver into gold as Singaporeans live longer,Sep 22 2019,"Singapore now has the world's longest-living population, stealing the crown from long-reigning champion Japan. While the coveted spot is testament to the rising standards of living and healthcare here, longevity comes with its own issues, such as the need for more retirement savings, and rising medical costs.Vanessa Liu In the Healthy For 100 roundtable discussion presented by Prudential Singapore, The Straits Times tackles the following questions with the help of guest panellists: Should people continue working past retirement age? Will insurance premiums skyrocket as healthcare costs rise? What must be done so that we do not only live long, but live well too? Ageing should be looked on as ""silver dividends to be reaped"" instead of a ""silver tsunami to be feared"", noted Senior Minister of State for Health Amy Khor as she opened the discussion, although she agreed that the picture was not all rosy. ""We need to acknowledge that there are challenges to ageing... If not, some people would not have referred to it as a silver tsunami,"" she said. On the bright side, older people are a ""very precious resource"" to be tapped, in employment, volunteering and caregiving, said Associate Professor Lim Wee Shiong, senior geriatric consultant at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. ""In a workforce, we need the vibrance, the energy and the creativity of young people, but having older ones around with experience, perspective and their mentoring is also important,"" he said. He cited a US-based literacy programme where volunteers aged 50 and above tutored vulnerable children who were struggling in school. The schools that ran this programme became popular because of its success. Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Health Mr Wilf Blackburn, chief executive of Prudential Singapore Associate Professor Lim Wee Shiong, senior geriatric consultant at Tan Tock Seng Hospital Ms Rachel Ngo, deputy director of the healthy ageing division at the Health Promotion Board Ms Salma Khalik, senior health correspondent at The Straits Times Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  The panellists also sought to turn the definition of ""old"" on its head. Prof Lim pointed out that until recently, demographic data grouped by age bands would categorise everyone in five-year bands, but those above 65 were lumped into the same band. Now, there is greater segmentation of older people into further sub-groups. ""I think we're increasingly recognising there are many segments: People in their 60s have different needs from people in their 90s,"" he noted. ""Sometimes it's just the simple things like remembering to break down the data and not lump everybody together. That will start to change attitudes."" Ms Rachel Ngo, deputy director of the healthy ageing division at the Health Promotion Board, said what is important is not so much age, but that one should be well enough to ""continue to do what you want to do for as long as you can"". ""It's not just about when you can start drawing down from CPF, or when you can start getting your ez-link card for senior concession,"" she said. As Singaporeans live longer, many will need to keep working to finance a retirement that could stretch to four decades. But employment brings other benefits besides income, such as a sense of fulfilment, a boost to self-esteem and the chance to contribute to society, noted Dr Khor. Prof Lim noted that work helps people to stay meaningfully engaged, which may in turn help to fend off neuro-degenerative diseases common among the elderly, such as dementia. Other ways include volunteering and taking on caregiving roles, he noted. The Silver Volunteer Fund was launched in 2015 as part of the Government's plans to encourage active ageing. The fund is used to support voluntary welfare organisations that develop programmes providing volunteering opportunities and training to seniors. Dr Khor said that as of last month, more than 6,900 new senior recruits had benefited from the fund. INCREASED SUBSIDIES DR AMY KHOR, Senior Minister of State for Health. MANAGING TRANSITIONS ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR LIM WEE SHIONG, senior geriatric consultant at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. BEING AN ATTRACTIVE EMPLOYER MR WILF BLACKBURN, chief executive of Prudential Singapore. TAKING PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY TOO MS RACHEL NGO, deputy director of the healthy ageing division at the Health Promotion Board. An older workforce is inevitable, given the country's low total fertility rates. By 2030, one in four people will be 65 and above. ""Allowing older workers who wish to work and are able to do so really does help our employers address some of these manpower challenges,"" said Dr Khor. Last year, 43.8 per cent of people here between 65 and 69 were employed, compared with 25.7 per cent in 2007, according to figures from the Ministry of Manpower. Over 90 per cent of eligible private sector employees who wished to continue working were offered re-employment at age 62, and two-thirds of them were able to continue on their existing contracts, without a specific end date. In October last year, Prudential Singapore became one of the companies that allow their employees to continue working beyond age 62 with no change to their terms. The oldest employee at Prudential Singapore is 64. Prudential Singapore chief executive Wilf Blackburn said the move made commercial sense in an intensely competitive labour market like Singapore. ""Because people don't stop being able to do their jobs well just because they hit their 62nd or 65th birthday,"" he noted. ""For me, it's an obvious thing to do, particularly as the population ages, to make ourselves attractive as an employer to more senior people."" Mr Blackburn offered assurances to younger employees who fear they may not move up the ladder if older staff members remain in their positions. He said many of Prudential's older employees want to keep working but not always at the same level of responsibility. Some senior Prudential employees have stepped down from their management roles to be part of the team, while others took on alternative roles within the organisation. Dr Khor agreed that many seniors might prefer to work on a part-time or ad-hoc basis or take on alternative roles as mentor or consultant to junior employees. With ""clever and conscientious"" job redesign, Dr Khor said, employers can continue tapping their strengths, while younger employees do not have to worry about their chances of progression. Mr Blackburn added that a work environment that offers flexibility and no symbols of status will also help senior workers to be comfortable in reduced roles. ""In an environment where nobody has an office and everyone has the same facilities, nobody feels bad if they take on a lower level of responsibility, and I think everyone feels more comfortable in that situation,"" he noted. But an optimistic outlook for ageing can be very quickly reversed by poor health, and a study out earlier this year showed that while Singaporeans are living longer, they also spend correspondingly more years in disability and illness. The average person has a life expectancy of 84.8 years, but despite enjoying the longest healthspan of 74.2 years in the world, he will spend 10.6 years in ill health and grapple with chronic conditions such as diabetes and dementia. The prevalence rate of chronic conditions such as diabetes for Singaporeans aged 18 to 69 years old increased by 4 per cent between 2010 and 2017, while the rate for hypertension rose 14 per cent. Figures from the Ministry of Health showed that about two-thirds of Singapore residents between 65 and 74, and 70 per cent of those aged 75 years and above were reported to have at least one known chronic condition - diabetes, high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol - last year. Prof Lim noted that the healthcare system, while having done a ""very good job for the past 30 or 40 years"", was designed largely for episodic care, or acute illnesses, in younger people. With more older patients suffering from multiple interacting diseases, there is a need to review the system so that it adapts to changing needs, he added. Dr Khor said if chronic conditions were not properly managed, serious conditions will follow that will impact quality of life. Ms Ngo noted, however, that it is possible to continue to function and be productive at work if chronic conditions are managed well. She urged people to plan to age in good health and act on it as early as possible, adopting habits such as exercise, a good diet and regular check-ups before health problems start surfacing. The paradox is that people who are well tend to take good health for granted, even though they would ""reap the biggest dividends"" if they were to invest in a healthier lifestyle, said Prof Lim. ""Exercise is king. Nutrition is queen. Together they make a kingdom,"" he added. Another crucial factor in physical health is psychological well-being, said Prof Lim, citing a study of nonagenarians which found that psychological factors such as resilience, optimism and neuroticism played a part in determining whether seniors aged well or not. He added that society needs to look at properly managing major life transitions - such as retirement, stepping into a caregiving role and bereavement - as these events have an impact on mental well-being.

Living longer can also mean living well,Sep 22 2019,"It should not be seen as a silver tsunami, but as silver dividends to be reaped. This comment from Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Health, sums up what the panellists at the Healthy For 100 forum earlier this month felt about the increasingly long lifespans here. While living till 100 might be fantasy in some countries, it is rapidly becoming real for Singaporeans, whose life expectancy has gone up by three years every decade since independence in 1965. If this trend continues unabated, life expectancy here will be hitting 100 by 2070. Singapore already has more than 1,300 centenarians. What is the country going to do with all these elderly folk? Living longer sounds great, but does it also pose problems? Looking at it rationally, there appears to be only positives. Singapore has been struggling with low birth rates for a long time. As a result, the number of younger, working-age people has shrunk as a percentage of the population - not a good thing for the economy. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  In recent years, the Government has been raising the spectre of a declining old-age support ratio. This is the number of 20-to 64-year-olds ( the working-age group) supporting those who are 65 years and older (the dependent group). The ratio has fallen from a high of 13.5 in 1970 to just 4.8 last year. In other words, where there used to be 13.5 people working to support one elderly person then, there are now only 4.8 people working to support one retiree. Those poor younger people need to work much harder to garner wealth for themselves. But between 1970 and today, life expectancy for Singaporeans has also increased by 15 years. This has major implications. If we continue expecting people aged 20 to 64 to support those aged 65 and older, the burden does not just come from there being more people in the older group. They are also living longer, and hence need to be ""supported"" for more years. In 1970, 65-year-olds could expect to live an average of 8.4 more years. Last year, they had an average of 21.1 years more to live. Today, older folks need to be ""supported"" for 12.7 years more than they did in 1970. This is a truly daunting task. So let us turn to the silver lining in Singapore's ageing population. The 15 years of added life are not all sick years. It is common to hear today that 60 is the new 40, which suggests that a 60-year-old now is as fit as a 40-year-old in years gone by. That may well be true, which also means they may not need support from the age of 65. It was in recognition of this that the Government announced that the retirement and re-employment ages would be raised to 65 and 70 years. This still lags behind the retirement ages in many developed countries with older populations. The retirement age in Norway, Israel and Italy is 67, while Japan has plans to raise it to 70, or even 75. If one expects to live to 100 years or more, 65 and 70 years may still be too young to retire. Fortunately, there are already companies employing people who are much older. The option to remain gainfully employed, so long as a person is able and willing to work, will help both the economy and those who need to finance their decades of retirement. How will having people stay on their jobs for more years affect the career paths of younger cohorts? Will they be holding back the promotion of their younger colleagues? Fortunately, real life is not a zero sum game where benefits for one group negate those for another. As Dr Khor rightly pointed out, companies will maximise the abilities of all their workers. So younger workers who do well will be given their due rewards. Singapore has moved away from a salary structure based on age to one based on performance. So there should be little link between a person's age and the position he holds and the remuneration he gets. This brings up another point: It is important to stay healthy in old age in order to continue working, or just be able to make the most out of life. At age 65, men here can expect, on average, to suffer 4.5 years of poor health and women 5.8 years. In contrast, in Sweden at the age of 65, men face 3.2 unhealthy years and women 4.8 such years. Their life expectancy is only slightly shorter than that for Singaporeans. Surely Singapore can also reduce the number of years people here spend in ill health. Associate Professor Lim Wee Shiong, a senior geriatric consultant at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, said frailty and dementia are two sides of a coin. One is physical and the other mental, but both affect a person's ability to live independently. The solution to both is fairly similar, he said, and includes eating healthily, exercising regularly and being socially engaged. But to reduce the number of unhealthy years of life, people have to start young. This is something they have to commit to themselves. With any luck, this will result in Singaporeans not just living longer but, more importantly, living well too. As someone who, in two days, will officially move from the group providing support to the one receiving support - yup, I turn 65 on Tuesday - I can say with conviction it is time to reassess the contributions the latter can make.

The index was based on a survey of more than 3,600 SMEs between July 8 and Aug 16, and registers expectations in seven areas: Turnover, profitability, business expansion, capital investment, hiring, capacity utilisation and access to financing. The softer business outlook for the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year comes amid the Ministry of Trade and Industry's revision of Singapore's full-year forecast to between zero growth and 1 per cent. Overall, the index fell from 50.8 to 50.6, reversing the uptrend last quarter. A reading above 50 indicates that companies expect business to improve in the next six months, while a reading below 50 indicates that they expect lower business activity. All seven sub-indicators saw declining expectations in the latest quarterly survey, said SBF and Experian yesterday. The manufacturing sector in particular saw negative turnover expectations due to a global slowdown in demand for manufactured goods. Profitability expectations fell, marking five consecutive quarters of negative expectations. There was also a decline in hiring expectations. Lenders appear to be more wary in extending loans to these firms, with the sector seeing the biggest drop in expectations for access to financing. Manufacturing is not the only sector that has seen dampened sentiment. With no apparent end in sight for the US-China trade war, SMEs in commerce and trading are looking to lower trade volumes, leading to negative profitability and turnover expectations.

Mr James Gothard, Experian's general manager for credit services and strategy in South-east Asia, called the decline in optimism among SMEs in retail and F&B ""troubling"", noting that it could point to how economic uncertainty has impacted consumer sentiment, affecting domestically oriented sectors.

Only 1 in 2 Singaporeans feels fulfilled in life with finances seen as biggest obstacle: AXA survey,Sep 24 2019,"SINGAPORE - One in two Singaporeans does not feel fulfilled in life with finances cited as the biggest obstacle to achieving life goals, according to a survey commissioned by insurer AXA. For the inaugural AXA Better Life Index 2019, released on Tuesday (Sept 24), research firm Nielsen polled 1,008 Singaporeans aged 18-65 across four generations: Gen Z (18-24 years old), millennials (25-39), Gen X (40-54), and baby boomers (55-65). The survey evaluates the overall journey towards a better life among Singaporeans, taking into account three components: realisation, empowerment, and achievement. Across all four generations surveyed, wealth-related goals ranked high for both short-term and long-term goals. When questioned about the struggles faced in reaching goals, money-related matters such as the increasing cost of living (51 per cent), and the inability to save enough money (35 per cent) came up as the most common concerns. Overall, Singaporeans have a Better Life Index score of 50.4, with 41 per cent saying they are not happy with their lives currently, AXA said. Millennials (54.8) seem to be the most driven to achieve their goals in life, having scored the highest among the four generations. Jean Drouffe, chief executive officer of AXA Insurance Singapore, said: ""Self-belief fuels one's journey in life. That is why we strive to play a part in helping our customers feel confident that they can achieve their goals. With the AXA Better Life Index, we want to understand Singaporeans' progress towards achieving their better life, and how they can be encouraged as they work towards it."" The survey also found that while a majority of Singaporeans have set short-term (78 per cent) and long-term (56 per cent) goals, at least three in 10 have not set a clear timeline to achieve them. Unsurprisingly, younger Singaporeans held a higher regard for money as part of their life goals, while older age groups were more concerned with their health in the long run. Baby Boomers (57 per cent) were found to be the most fulfilled in their achievements, relationships and other aspects of life, while Generation Z (40 per cent) was the least fulfilled. That said, quizzed on whether they feel they are capable of achieving a ""better life"", millennials scored the highest, while baby boomers ranked bottom, suggesting that they are the age group that needs the most support, AXA said.

12 global initiatives to beat back climate threats,Sep 24 2019,"BARCELONA (REUTERS) - Close to 30 global initiatives to ramp up action on climate change were unveiled or expanded at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York, the United Nations said. Bringing together governments, businesses, development banks, cities and green groups, they cover everything from zero-carbon buildings to cleaning up air pollution and a platform for poor countries to access international finance for clean energy. Here are 12, announced alongside commitments by about 65 countries to upgrade their climate plans, with the aim of upping the world's chance of reducing planet-warming emissions to net zero by mid-century and meeting agreed temperature limits: 1. Almost 90 companies with a market capitalisation of more than US$2.3 trillion (S$3.17 trillion) and annual direct emissions equivalent to 73 coal-fired power plants pledged to take action to align their business plans with scientific targets laying out what is needed to keep global warming to 1.5 deg C. 2. The Powering Past Coal Alliance said it had added seven new members, to include 32 nations, 25 states or regions, and 34 companies committed to phasing out coal power generation and ending the building of new coal power plants by 2020. 3. The Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance, a group of the world's largest pension funds and insurers - which together manage US$2.3 trillion in investments - agreed to make their investment portfolios carbon-neutral by 2050. 4. The International Development Finance Club, a leading group of 24 national and regional development banks, set a goal of raising US$1 trillion by 2025 for climate action in poorer countries, with an increasing share of that going to work to help them adapt to climate threats and build greater resilience. 5. The City Climate Finance Gap Fund backed by the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, together with Germany and Luxembourg, said it would provide up to 50 million euros (S$75.7 million) in grants to develop low-carbon, climate-safe infrastructure projects in cities. It hopes to be able to double the grants to unlock at least 4 billion euros in investment, and will work with at least a dozen cities per year. 6. The Zero Carbon Buildings for All Initiative pledged to ensure new buildings produce no more climate-changing emissions than they can absorb by 2030, with existing buildings meeting that goal by 2050 in member countries around the world, which include Kenya, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Britain. 7. A new Climate Investment Platform will enable developing countries to access finance for clean energy investment more easily. Support for other areas of climate action, such as adaptation, land use, cities and infrastructure, would be added in 2020, its backers said. 8. The ""Three Per cent Club"", a coalition of 15 countries, as well as businesses and institutions, said it would work to drive a 3 per cent annual global increase in energy efficiency, up from 1.3% in 2018, by including measures in national plans and sharing expertise. 9. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank, the European Commission, Britain, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden and Germany promised to invest more than US$650 million in the CGIAR group of agricultural research centres over the next three years to help 300 million smallholder farmers in developing countries adapt to climate pressures. The funding is part of a broader commitment of more than US$790 million to address the impact of climate change on food and agriculture. 10. The Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment - a group of 34 companies and organisations managing assets worth US$5 trillion - said it aims to ensure that finance for infrastructure takes into account climate risks, leading to more robust roads, bridges, energy, telecoms and other key services. 11. The Clean Air Initiative will urge governments at national and local level to commit to achieving air that is safe and healthy, and to align their climate change and air pollution policies by 2030. A Clean Air Fund - with US$50 million in initial funding - also was launched to tackle outdoor air pollution and reduce related deaths. The fund aims to raise a total of US$100 million. 12. The World Bank and Germany launched Progreen, a global partnership - involving agriculture, mining and other sectors, as well as governments - to boost efforts to curb deforestation and forest fires, restore degraded land and improve incomes in poor, rural communities. It will start with funding of 200 million euros from Germany and aims to ultimately raise about US$1 billion. ","{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.834, 'pos': 0.14, 'compound': 0.9971}",0.9971
Swiss financiers face Green backlash after election,Oct 21 2019,"ZURICH () - Switzerland's Greens took aim at the country's financial services sector after parliamentary election gains which shifted the balance of political power to the left. “We have to hold the financial center more accountable,” Greens leader Regula Rytz told Neue Zuercher Zeitung, adding that the sector, which accounts for 9% of the economy, had 20 times more impact on climate change than the Swiss population. “Do not invest any longer in coal or fossil energy. Renewable energies are the opportunity for the future,” Rytz said in an interview published on Monday after the Greens' best ever showing in Sunday's Swiss elections amid growing climate change concern. Switzerland's Greens gained a record 17 seats to hold 28 in the 200-seat lower house, putting them in fourth place. The more centrist and pro-business Green Liberal Party added nine seats to control 16, leaving the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) weakened but still parliament's biggest force. Rytz called for an all-party roundtable on the policy response to climate change in landlocked Switzerland, where temperatures are rising twice as fast as the global average. It was not immediately clear what steps Rytz had in mind for the finance sector, whose biggest players, including UBS and Credit Suisse have increasingly made sustainable investment a watchword. But they have faced protests by climate activists and UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti has advised caution on moving too quickly, citing risks that too abrupt a shift could wreak economic havoc on developing societies.  Marie-Claire Graf, 23, who helped organize climate strikes in Switzerland, has said activists may target investment policy. “Private banks are the main players but it will be easier to regulate the pension funds and the Swiss National Bank because they have a national mandate and are not in line with the Paris agreement so are working against our own values,” she said. Zurich Insurance and Swiss Re have pledged not to cover or invest in companies that generate more than 30% of their revenue from coal.  Environmentalists' gains boost chances that parliament will approve slapping a carbon surcharge on airline tickets. The government in August stepped up its climate ambitions, including reducing Switzerland's net carbon emissions to zero by 2050 to meet the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees. After the Fukushima disaster in 2011, Switzerland began phasing out nuclear power, which typically produces nearly 40% of electricity. Hydropower has a share of around 57%.

Canada's Trudeau retains power in election but will have minority government,Oct 21 2019,"MONTREAL () - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals held onto power after a closely fought election on Monday but were reduced to a minority government that will need the support in Parliament of a smaller left-leaning party. The vote showed a deeply divided country with the defeated Conservatives winning the popular vote, while a resurgent separatist Bloc Quebecois made big strides in the mainly French-speaking province of Quebec. The Liberals had won or were leading in 156 out of 338 seats in Monday's vote, according to Elections Canada. That put the Liberals far short of the 170 seats needed for a second straight majority government.  “You did it, my friends. Congratulations,” Trudeau told supporters in Montreal early on Tuesday, speaking as his main opponents were giving concession speeches. Trudeau, who took power in 2015 as a charismatic figure promising “sunny ways,” saw his popularity drop over old photos of him in blackface and his handling of a corporate corruption case. He will now have to rely on the New Democratic Party (NDP) to push through key legislation. Although the NDP had a disappointing night, with the 24 seats it had won or was leading in down sharply from the 2015 election when it won 44, the party could exercise significant influence over Trudeau's next government. “I think a Liberal government supported by the NDP is likely going to lean farther left,” said John Manley, a former Liberal finance minister who now works in the private sector. “It raises a series of issues about what are the demands that an NDP party would make. What's the price of governing going to be? I think businesses are going to be reluctant to make any moves until they get some satisfaction around that.”  NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said he had spoken with Trudeau and  told him his party would be “working hard to deliver on making sure we deliver the priorities that Canadians have.” Minority governments in Canada rarely last more than 2-1/2 years. Ahead of the vote, opinion polls showed a tight race between Trudeau and his main rival, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer. “Tonight we have put him on notice,” Scheer said in Regina, Saskatchewan, of Trudeau. “His leadership is damaged and his government will end soon and when that time comes, we will be ready and we will win. “We are the government in waiting,” added Scheer, 40, whose party won 122 seats. Trudeau, 47, who has championed diversity as prime minister, was endorsed by former U.S. President Barack Obama in the final stretch of the campaign and is viewed as one of the last remaining progressive leaders among the world's major democracies. But the son of the late Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau also had to overcome a sense of fatigue with his government. U.S. President Donald Trump, whose relationship with Trudeau has been testy at times, congratulated him “on a wonderful and hard fought victory” via Twitter. The Bloc Quebecois saw its support jump in Quebec, the only place where the separatist party contests elections. It was elected or ahead in 32 seats, more than three times what the party won in 2015. “Dear Quebecers, I heard your message tonight,” said Trudeau, who also addressed voters in two western provinces where Liberals were shut out of seats. “To Canadians in Alberta and Saskatchewan, know that you are an essential part of our great country. I've heard your frustration and I want to be there to support you. Let us all work hard to bring our country together,” he said. The Greens, who have assailed Trudeau for not doing enough to combat climate change, also made gains on Monday. The Canadian dollar was little changed after the Liberal win, holding at near three-month highs.     “Markets don't like uncertainty so it will all depend on what coalition they can come up with and how sustainable that will become,” said Greg Taylor, portfolio manager at Purpose Investments in Toronto. “The bigger problem is it seems that Canadians have never been more divided and the next government really needs to work to correct that. Alberta is at risk of a broader separatist movement and that would be a major negative for Canada.” Two Liberal Cabinet ministers lost their seats in western Canada, including veteran Ralph Goodale, the public safety minister. Anger at Trudeau has mounted in the oil-producing region over federal environmental policies that the energy industry says will harm output. The oil industry's top lobbying group has blamed Trudeau's policies for throttling investment in the sector, and some global energy companies have shed assets in the oil sands region of Alberta, the country's main oil-producing province.  Canada's economy, however, has been on a general upswing in 2019. The Canadian dollar has been the best-performing G10 currency this year, rising more than 4% against its U.S. counterpart, as the economy added jobs at a robust pace and inflation stayed closed to the Bank of Canada's 2% target.     The six-week official campaign period was a rough and meandering ride with dirty tactics on both sides in the G7 country. The liberal image of Trudeau, whose father opened the country to mass immigration, took a severe blow when pictures emerged early in the campaign of him wearing blackface in the early 1990s and in 2001. Trudeau had already been wrestling with the fallout from accusations he pressured his justice minister to help shield engineering firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc from corruption charges. In August, a top watchdog said Trudeau breached ethics rules. Scheer also proved to be a determined opponent, although his hopes for a major breakthrough were dashed. He had promised to balance the federal budget and eliminate a “carbon tax” on fossil fuels. “The Tories made a fundamental mistake by being opposed to the carbon tax,” said Hugh Segal, who was chief of staff to former Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. “I've often heard it said the worst mistake a party can make is to get sucked into its own low expectations of the population,” he said.

European shares rise amid Brexit tussle as focus shifts to earnings,Oct 21 2019,"() - European shares broke a three-day run of losses on Monday, as  investors stuck to hopes that Britain will avoid a disorderly exit from the European Union, while positive corporate updates and comments on U.S.-China trade talks added to the upbeat mood. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  ended the session 0.6% higher, barely budging on news House of Commons speaker John Bercow refused to allow a vote on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit divorce deal, saying the same issue had been discussed on Saturday. A spokesman said the government would now introduce Brexit legislation this week. Lawmakers on Saturday forced the British government to seek a delay to the Oct. 31 deadline, which analysts said reduced the chances of a no-deal Brexit. London's blue-chip FTSE 100  was up 0.2%, lagging the broader markets due to a strong pound, while the FTSE mid-cap index of domestically focused stocks  closed up 0.4%. “The chances of a deal one way or the other are higher than they were two weeks ago, which is why the market is not falling back,” said Rupert Thompson, head of research at Kingswood Group. “The way it would be, we're more than half way through if you actually saw the deal being approved by the Parliament.” Germany's GDAXI .DAX jumped 0.9%, leading gains among major regional indexes. Business software group SAP's () shares gained 2.5% after saying it had reached a three-year deal with Microsoft () to help its enterprise customers move their business processes into the cloud. The company also reiterated its forecast for the year and through to 2023. German payments company Wirecard () jumped 6% on news the firm was hiring KPMG to conduct an independent audit to address allegations in the Financial Times that its finance team had sought to inflate its reported sales and profits. Most sub-sectors were in the black, led by miners .SXPP and banks .SX7P, but defensive sectors including healthcare .SXDP and real estate .SX86P lagged the broader market. Aiding sentiment, a White House official said that U.S. tariffs scheduled for December on Chinese goods could be withdrawn if negotiations continue to go well. Investors will be scanning third-quarter report cards from European firms to assess their health amid lingering Brexit and trade uncertainties. UK-listed RBS () and Barclays () are scheduled to report this week, kicking off bank earnings. Companies listed in STOXX 600 are expected to report a 3.7% drop in third-quarter earnings, worse than the 3% fall expected a week ago, according to Refinitiv IBES data. However, early reports were positive, with shares of Swedish engineering firm Atlas Copco () jumping nearly 10% to the top of STOXX 600 after it reported forecast-beating third-quarter earnings and order bookings on strong demand from chipmakers. By contrast Smith+Nephew () sank 9% after the medical device maker said its Chief Executive Namal Nawana was stepping down after just 17 months in the role. Meanwhile, the Berlin government's move to freeze rents put real estate companies such as Deutsche Wohnen (), Ado Properties () and Vonovia () under pressure. Their shares fell between 1% and 2.6%.

"Facing protests, Lebanon approves emergency economic reforms",Oct 21 2019,"BEIRUT () - Lebanon approved an emergency reform package on Monday in response to protests over dire economic conditions, but the moves did not go far enough to persuade demonstrators to leave the streets or investors to halt a plunge in its bonds. Hundreds of thousands of people have flooded the streets since Thursday, furious at a political class they accuse of pushing the economy to the point of collapse. Roads were blocked for a fifth day across the country. Schools, banks and businesses were closed, and Banks are expected to remain shut on Tuesday.  Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, in a televised speech, said the new measures might not meet the protesters' demands but were a start towards achieving some of them. The government must work to recover trust, he said. “You are the compass and ... your movement frankly is what led us to this decision today,” added Hariri, who said big steps had been taken towards fighting corruption and waste. But despite the reforms, Lebanon's dollar-denominated bounds suffered hefty losses on Monday following sharp drops on Friday. Some sank to record lows. Investors said the turmoil showed Lebanon was running out of time to fix its economic problems. “It is just a mess - and it looks like it is more and more unsustainable. I don't think it is a final nail in the coffin - but it is looking ominous,” said Kevin Daly, Senior Investment Manager, Emerging Market Debt at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “There has been fiscal adjustment, but it has not been enough.”  The reforms included the symbolic halving of the salaries of ministers and lawmakers, as well as moves towards implementing long-delayed measures vital to putting the public finances on a sustainable path. Maya Mhana, a teacher listening to the speech in Beirut with other protesters, was not convinced. “We are remaining in the streets, we don't believe a single word he said,” she said. Protesters sang into the night in Beirut and continued to demonstrate in other parts of the country. “We don't believe that they can change in two days,” said Fadi Abou Dargham, a 55-year-old jeweler.  The protests have been extraordinary because of their size and geographic reach in a country where political movements are normally divided on sectarian lines and struggle to draw nationwide appeal. Lebanon has one of the world's highest levels of government debt as a share of economic output. The government includes most major parties, run by politicians widely perceived to have mobilized state resources and influence for their own gain. The economy has been hit by political paralysis and regional conflicts, compounded by strains in the financial system that have risen as inward capital flows have slowed. Unemployment among the under 35s runs at 37%.     Lebanese have started to feel pressures in the financial system more acutely of late, with dollars becoming harder to obtain at the official exchange rate. The pound, pegged at its current rate for two decades, has been under pressure. International donors last year pledged $11 billion to help Lebanon finance capital investment, conditional on reforms. Hariri said the new decisions would satisfy donors and the government would approve within three weeks the first phase of the capital investment program. The government approved a 2020 budget with no new taxes and a deficit of around 0.6% of national output, Hariri said, describing this as a historic achievement. The deficit for 2019 is around 7% of GDP. Lebanon's large banking sector would contribute 5.1 trillion Lebanese pounds ($3.4 billion) to deficit reduction, including through an increase in the tax on bank profits, Hariri said. Steps included abolishing the information ministry and some other state bodies. The government would accelerate the long-delayed reform of the state-run power sector, which drains $2 billion from the treasury per year while failing to deliver enough power for Lebanese who depend on private generators to fill the gap. Nassib Ghobril, Byblos Bank chief economist, said the reforms sounded good on paper but there were “a lot of question marks”. He criticized the increased taxes on banks, which were hit by a tax hike in 2018. Rampant evasion must be fought. “The approach seems to have not changed,” he said. “The government considers the private sector only as a source of tax revenues instead of working to improve the investment climate, the business climate and raising the economy's competitiveness.” (This story has been refiled to remove duplicate word “dollars” in paragraph 17)  ","{'neg': 0.125, 'neu': 0.8, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': -0.9904}",-0.9904
Chile's Pinera vows 'new social contract' amid massive marches against inequality,Oct 21 2019,"SANTIAGO () - Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Monday evening he would meet opposition leaders to forge a “new social contract” to alleviate inequality as thousands of Chileans defied a military curfew in protest marches around the capital.  Pinera struck a conciliatory tone in a national address from the Moneda Palace in Santiago after declaring on Sunday from the city's military barracks that the country was “at war” against vandals, a statement that sparked outrage in some quarters. “If sometimes I have spoken harshly... it's because it makes me indignant to see the damage and pain that this violence causes,” the 69-year-old conservative billionaire said. Thousands of Chileans poured into Santiago's central squares on Monday to protest high living costs after a weekend of looting, arson and clashes with security forces killed 11 people.  The crisis was sparked by protests over an increase in public transport fares but reflects simmering anger over intense economic inequality in Chile, as well as costly health, education and pension systems seen by many as inadequate. Throughout Monday demonstrators spread along main thoroughfares and bridges around the city, remaining on the streets until past 8 p.m., when an official military curfew came into force, before soldiers gradually dispersed them using water cannons, tear gas and verbal persuasion. Although he had described protesters as “delinquents” in previous statements, Pinera this time referred to “small groups” of vandals that had ransacked market stalls, supermarkets and small businesses, requiring a reconstruction plan that would cost “hundreds of millions of dollars”.   “We want to repair not only the physical damage but also the moral damage that these acts of violence have caused in the body and soul of our country,” he said.  He vowed to find ways to reduce the costs of basic services like electricity and highway tolls, improve the country´s pension offerings and reduce the price of medication and medical waiting lists. “I am very conscious that this is a first step and we have a long way to go,” he said.      Buses and metro networks were partially restored on Monday for people to return to work but many opted instead to join the biggest demonstrations in years in what is normally one of Latin America's most stable countries. Banging drums and pans, blowing whistles and waving signs calling for Pinera's ouster, the largely youthful and peaceful crowd filled Santiago's Plaza Italia and overflowed into surrounding streets, watched from the sidelines by soldiers and police, with helicopters hovering overhead.  “Pinera, listen! Go to hell!” the crowds chanted.  Jose Jimenez, 33, a filmmaker who had joined the protest, told  it was hard to predict what would come next.  “Something has broken,” he said. “The government has shown itself to be completely inept and until there's a way to respond to or contain this situation, I think it's only going to keep growing.”  Both the peso and the country's IPSA blue-chip stock exchange lost ground on Monday after the clashes.  Officials late Sunday said the country's copper mining industry, the world's largest, was operating normally, though the union of BHP's Escondida copper mine workers announced a daylong strike on Tuesday in solidarity with the protests. Finance minister Felipe Larrain said the civil unrest would “undoubtedly” have a “significant” impact on the economy. Dr. Jaime Manalich, the health minister, said 239 civilians had been injured in three days of unrest, while the death toll was raised to 11. Interior Minister Andres Chadwick said one man had died of gunshot injuries in the northern province of Coquimbo. Chile's Institute of Human Rights said it had made contact with 1,333 people detained in the protests, including 181 children and adolescents, along with 88 people who had been shot, five of whom were in serious condition and one in critical.  U.N. human rights boss Michelle Bachelet, a former president of Chile, called on Monday for independent investigations into the deaths in weekend protests, citing “disturbing allegations” of excessive use of force by security forces.

Ex-CEOs plead guilty to roles in U.S. college admissions scandal,Oct 21 2019,"BOSTON () - Four wealthy parents including the former chief executives of bond manager Pimco and specialty finance lender Hercules Capital Inc pleaded guilty on Monday to participating in a vast U.S. college admissions cheating and fraud scheme. Federal prosecutors in Boston say ex-Pimco CEO Douglas Hodge, Hercules Capital founder Manuel Henriquez and his wife, Elizabeth and onetime food manufacturer executive Michelle Janavs took part in a bribery scheme that helped their children gain admission to universities as fake athletic recruits. The four are among 52 people charged with participating in a vast scheme in which wealthy parents conspired with a California college admissions consultant to use bribery and other forms of fraud to secure the admission of their children to top schools. William “Rick” Singer, the consultant, pleaded guilty in March to charges he facilitated cheating on college entrance exams and helped bribe sports coaches at universities to present his clients' children as fake athletic recruits.  The 35 parents charged in the investigation include celebrities, such as “Desperate Housewives” star Felicity Huffman and “Full House” actress Lori Loughlin. Huffman reported to prison last week to serve a 14-day term after admitting she engaged in the cheating scheme. Loughlin has pleaded not guilty. Monday's pleas by the four parents came as another defendant, Martin Fox, who headed a tennis academy in Texas, agreed to plead guilty to helping facilitate the scheme and cooperate with investigators. Hodge, who was CEO of Allianz SE's Pimco from 2014 to 2016, admitted he paid $525,000 to facilitate the admission of his daughter and son to the University of Southern California (USC) as soccer and football recruits through the use of bribery. “I acted out of love for my children, but I know that this explanation for my actions is not an excuse,” Hodge said in a statement. The Henriquez couple turned to Singer to inflate fraudulently their two daughters' entrance exam scores and also paid him $400,000 to bribe a tennis coach to help their older daughter gain admission to Georgetown University, prosecutors alleged. Manuel Henriquez, who was chairman and CEO of Hercules prior to his arrest in March, in court disputed some of those claims but acknowledged he was guilty, adding he “never intended to hurt anybody.” Janavs conspired with Singer to pay $600,000 to facilitate  admission of two children to USC and Georgetown as athletes and paid another $100,000 to have a corrupt exam proctor correct her two daughters' answers on the ACT exam, prosecutors said.

Fallout from Trump's trade wars felt by economies around the world,Oct 20 2019,"WASHINGTON () - The collateral damage of the United States' trade wars is being felt from the fjords of Iceland to the auto factories of Japan.      Central bank governors and finance ministers traded grim tales of suffering economies at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank fall meetings in Washington this week. Some also  noted how far U.S. policy had shifted from the 1940s, when Washington co-founded the IMF. At that time, “the world economy had been hammered for over a decade by high tariff barriers, depression and war,” prompting then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau to champion a global economic system, World Bank President David Malpass told attendees at a session this week.  The U.S. message then, Malpass said, was: “First, there's no limit to prosperity. Second, broadly shared prosperity benefits everyone.”  As the IMF's gathering of 189 member-nations drew to a close, the unintended negative impacts of the trade wars were becoming clear, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said. “Everybody loses.” The United States, the world's largest importer, started a bitter tariff war with China, the world's largest exporter, 15 months ago. U.S. President Donald Trump is also in the midst of renegotiating, and sometimes upending, trade relationships with many of Washington's top trading partners. The fallout will slow global growth in 2019 to 3.0%, the slowest pace in a decade, the IMF estimated this week.  This pain is not being shared equally. The United States remains the least exposed of the world's 20 largest economies to a drop in exports in part because of its massive domestic consumer spending base.  (For a graphic that shows the impact of tariffs in the United States and around the world, click  ) The damage is being particularly felt in European countries which “rely on exports and are open to trade,” the European Union's Economic and Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said. More than 40% of Germany's GDP was derived from exports in 2018, the most of any major global economy. Uncertainty in the business community is widespread, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told reporters.  German trade group BGA recently revised down its growth forecast for German exports in 2019 to just 0.5%, from 1.5%. As a result, many companies are scaling back their investment plans, something that will have repercussions for years to come. Scholz said concerns over Britain's impending departure from the EU and the bloc's trade dispute with the United States were clearly dampening global economic growth.  “The most important problem remains those factors that we cannot measure – specifically the reluctance to invest,” Scholz said. The pain is being felt in countries that don't rely on exports too, such as Iceland, which became the first developed economy to seek aid from the IMF after a 2008 banking collapse. Since then, it has rebuilt its economy in what's been called a miraculous recovery. Now, that is threatened. “We have become dependent on tourism,” explained Ásgeir Jónsson, the governor of Iceland's central bank, with annual visitors growing five-fold to 2.5 million since the crisis. Foreign arrivals, however, have plummeted since the trade wars started, and are down 15.6% this summer from the year before.  Iceland, with a population of about 300,000, built foreign currency reserves on the back of the increase in visitors, he said, but those are dropping too.  Trade links between countries have led to a more peaceful world in recent decades, but recent experience shows “you can never take global trade for granted,” Jónsson said. On Friday, Japan's Cabinet Office, which helps coordinate government policy, downgraded its assessment of factory output in October.  The softness in production was largely due to car exports to the United States turning weaker, after growing steadily until the spring, a government official said at a briefing. “The pick-up in global growth is being delayed,” Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said. “Japan's economy is seeing exports weaken significantly and that's affecting factory output.” The United States hasn't been immune from the impact of the trade wars. American farmers have been particularly hurt by Chinese tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, prompting the Trump administration to give billions in aid to the farm belt.  Washington's imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs and uncertainty about passage of a new North American free trade deal - the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement - have also stalled local economic development. Christopher Cabaldon, the mayor of West Sacramento, California, said bids for a $100 million infrastructure project in the city came in 80% higher than expected in part because of construction firms' need to factor in higher costs and the risk of additional tariffs in the future. “Even in small cities like my own, we see the impacts of trade. We have come to realize the deep integration of our local economies in the global system,” Cabaldon told  ahead of the IMF and World Bank meetings. “Most of my economic development plans ... are playing out on a global stage, not down the freeway.” The trade tensions are helping to spur a push among African nations to create a more self-reliant continent. “We must take it upon ourselves to grow trade among ourselves,” said Ukur Yatani Kanacho, Kenya's acting cabinet secretary for treasury.  Abdoulaye Daouda Diallo, the finance minister of Senegal, told reporters the U.S.-China trade tensions would affect African nations in the energy sector and cut funds available on financial markets. The dispute underscored the importance of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, he said. Other emerging markets are also coming under pressure. “Ukrainian exporters faced worsened conditions in global commodity markets,” which drove down steel prices, said Kateryna Rozhkova, the deputy governor of the country's central bank.  Making matters worse, “the intensification of geopolitical conflicts led to rising oil and natural gas prices in the world,” she said. Bahrain's Finance Minister Sheikh Salman bin Khalifa Al Khalifa said the Gulf region was also affected by trade tensions and the resulting slowdown in investment, although geopolitical concerns – about Iran, for example – were another major factor. “Trade tensions create uncertainty and nobody is insulated from uncertainty,” he told .  Peru cut its 2019 economic growth estimate to 3% in August, from 4.2%, citing trade factors. Mexico is edging closer to a recession that its officials say might be more difficult to reverse than during the last downturn more than a decade ago. “The Great Recession basically caught everybody by surprise, but economies were willing to cooperate and work together to pull it out,” Mexican Finance Minister Arturo Herrera said. “This slowdown is taking nobody by surprise, but there is very little appetite for cooperation.” ","{'neg': 0.101, 'neu': 0.804, 'pos': 0.095, 'compound': -0.8794}",-0.8794
Italy's biggest bank wants to become less Italian,Oct 21 2019,"MILAN () - The chief executive of UniCredit () has a plan to revive his company's ailing share price - make it less Italian.  Italy's biggest bank is looking at whether it can distance itself from its home country's stagnating economy and fractious politics by putting some of its most prized assets under one roof in Germany, people familiar with the matter said. Jean Pierre Mustier will unveil on Dec. 3, as part of his new business plan, a scheme to set up a new sub-holding company in Germany to house the bank's foreign operations, the sources said. By keeping its assets in Germany, Austria, Eastern Europe and Turkey away from Italy, UniCredit could reduce their Italian identity - and associated credit rating - making their funding cheaper, the sources said. Mustier, a Frenchman appointed in July 2016 to reinvigorate the then weakly capitalized Milanese bank, has sold businesses, cut jobs and shut branches to strengthen UniCredit's balance sheet. Sources earlier this year said the bank had put on ice a possible bid for German rival Commerzbank (). But UniCredit, which describes itself as pan-European, operates in 14 countries and makes just over half of revenues outside Italy, is still essentially perceived by investors as a risky Italian institution.   The new plan is an indication of Mustier's belief that the Italian economy is holding back UniCredit's share price and risks pushing up the bank's funding even more if the economic outlook deteriorates.       “Who can say for sure that Italy's debt won't be downgraded to junk?” said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity and describing the corporate reorganization as an insurance policy if Italy's economy continues to perform poorly. “The bank has to be ready for that kind of possibility,” the person said, noting Moody's currently rates the euro zone's third biggest economy - burdened with the second highest debt to GDP ratio in the single currency bloc - just one notch above non-investment grade. Germany has a triple-A rating with all major credit ratings agencies.  Italian banks - which are struggling with bad loans, a sluggish economy and political instability - have traditionally been seen as a proxy for the country's sovereign debt because they hold vast amounts of government bonds. UniCredit trades at 0.5 times book value, among the lowest levels in the industry, despite having a better than average return on equity. Its share price has fallen 30% since April last year, wiping out much of the rally it had after Mustier took charge. To place a $3 billion, five-year bond in November last year, when a sell-off in Italian assets sent borrowing costs for the country's banks soaring and shut all but the strongest names out of the funding market, UniCredit had to pay a steep 7.8% coupon. “UniCredit is by size one of Europe's leading banking groups but, because of its Italian roots, investors associate it with the Italy risk to an extent which is in my opinion excessive given its geographical diversification,” Stefano Caselli, banking and finance professor at Milan's Bocconi University. “It's clear that UniCredit pays a price both in terms of regulatory capital and cost of funding for being Italian,” he said. “So a diversification strategy aimed at allowing the bank to link its cost of funding to the countries where it is present makes total sense.”  Some other Italian companies with big foreign operations, including car maker Fiat Chrysler () and broadcaster Mediaset (), have moved or are in the process of moving their legal headquarters to the Netherlands as part of a pivot away from Italy.   The European Central Bank would have to approve the plan to set up the holding company in Germany - where UniCredit already owns lender HVB - potentially taking at least a year, meaning the shift would not happen for sometime.  Mustier has repeatedly said that UniCredit will remain listed and headquartered in Milan and reiterated the bank's commitment to its home country. But since May he has steadily cut the bank's exposure to Italy, including by selling its stake in online broker FinecoBank () and announcing it would reduce its 55 billion euros ($61.37 billion) portfolio of Italian government bonds.  The bank is also considering cutting 10,000 jobs, or around 10% of its workforce, as part of the new 2020-2023 plan, almost all of them in Italy, sources said in July.  UniCredit has said any workforce reduction will be handled through early retirement. But the planned cuts, together with a wider management reshuffle earlier this year, have helped to create a perception among some employees and rivals that the bank is less focused on its Italian operations.  “You can tell that the Italian commercial business is not a priority for them, they are not aggressive, they are not chasing clients,” said the chief executive of another Italian bank. A UniCredit spokesperson said that figures from the bank's divisional database showed customer deposits for Italy's commercial banking operations rose by 4.3% in the second quarter of 2019 from a year earlier, while customer loans increased by 1.7% over the same period.

Sudan rebel leader says government agreed to open access for aid,Oct 21 2019,"JUBA () - Sudan has agreed to open humanitarian access to war-torn areas of the country for the first time in eight years as part of a new roadmap enabling suspended peace talks to resume, a rebel leader said on Monday.  “We are expecting that the humanitarian situation is going to improve in Darfur, Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile,” Yasir Arman, deputy head of a coalition of rebel groups, told .  The Sudanese government and major rebel groups agreed on Friday to the roadmap and signed a declaration confirming their commitment to it on Monday in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, which has hosted the talks for the past week. “Peace is the ultimate goal of the government of Sudan,” Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, a leading member of Sudan's transitional government, said after signing the agreement on Monday. “Peace will open a new path for the country. I appealed to the International Community to support the process.” The roadmap includes a cessation of hostilities agreement, which both parties have repeatedly broken in the past. The parties agreed on Monday to resume talks after a two-week break.  An end to multiple conflicts in Sudan is a prerequisite for the United States to remove the country from its list of sponsors of terrorism. Sudan is being led by a transitional government after a coup in April overthrew longtime autocrat Omar al Bashir after months of deadly protests. The agreement to open humanitarian access is something that Bashir's government refused to do for eight years, Arman said. “We believe we have a partner in Khartoum and there's a new environment created by the revolution,” he added. The new government in Khartoum is anxious to make peace. The government is cash-strapped and in need of debt relief and financing from multilateral lenders, but its designation as a state sponsor of terrorism has cut it off from such support.

Factbox: The reform plans agreed by Lebanese government amid massive protests,Oct 21 2019,"BEIRUT () - Lebanon's government on Monday agreed a package of long-stalled reforms to try to ease an economic crisis and defuse the biggest protests against the ruling elite in decades. The cabinet also approved a 2020 state budget that does not impose any new taxes on individuals and aims for a deficit of 0.6% of GDP, down from a previous target of around 7%. Commercial banks and the central bank are set to contribute to the deficit cut with 5.1 trillion Lebanese pounds ($3.4 billion), including through a tax hike on bank profits. Under pressure, Hariri and top officials drew up the package at the weekend, as hundreds of thousands of people flooded the streets to demand his government resigns.  Here is a list of the main plans the government agreed on: 1- A reduction of 1 trillion Lebanese pounds ($663 million) in the deficit in the power sector, which bleeds state funds while failing to meet the country's needs. Hariri said on Friday that covering the deficit of the state-owned electricity company costs the treasury $2 billion a year. 2- Speeding up the process of awarding contracts for the construction of new power plants to complete it within four months  3- Plans to approve, within three weeks, the first phase of a capital investment program that donors have pledged to finance with $11 billion, on condition of reforms 4- A 50% cut in the salaries of current and former presidents, ministers, and lawmakers 5- Appointing regulatory bodies for the power sector, telecommunications, and civil aviation “as soon as possible”  6- Scrapping the information ministry immediately and a number of obsolete government bodies  7- Setting up scanners at border crossings to combat smuggling and toughening punishments for smugglers 8- Providing an additional 20 billion Lebanese pounds ($13.3 million) to a program that supports poor families  9- Providing $160 million to back housing loans 10- Approving social security benefits for seniors by the end of the year. It was not clear how much this would cost.  11- Passing a law to create a national body to fight corruption by the end of the year 12- Drafting a law that seeks to restore stolen public funds 13- A 70% cut in the budgets of the state-run Council for Development and Reconstruction, the Central Fund for the Displaced, and the Council for South Lebanon 14- Launching investment projects for the northern and southern entrances of the capital Beirut 15- Approving a general amnesty law by the end of the year ","{'neg': 0.124, 'neu': 0.797, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': -0.9666}",-0.9666

Reckitt hires Ahold's Carr to take over as CFO in 2020,Oct 21 2019,"() - Reckitt Benckiser () named Ahold Delhaize () finance chief Jeff Carr as successor to Adrian Hennah, who is retiring as CFO of the British consumer goods company next year. The maker of Durex condoms and Lysol disinfectant said on Monday that Carr, who has been finance chief at Dutch-American supermarket operator Ahold since 2011, would bring “extensive experience across consumer and retail companies”. The appointment of Carr, who worked for Reckitt between 1994 and 2004, is its second big management change this year after replacing long-time chief executive Rakesh Kapoor with PepsiCo () executive Laxman Narasimhan as CEO. “Carr is known in the Food Retail industry as a CFO who has historically set conservative financial guidance, and successfully managed to meet or beat it,” Bernstein analyst Andrew Wood wrote in a note. “His reputation and conservative approach should help rebuild investor trust in the company,” Wood added. Shares in Slough-based Reckitt have slumped 16% over the past three years, during which it faced a safety scandal in South Korea, a failed product launch and a cyber attack.  This resulted in Kapoor's exit in September at a time when Reckitt is also battling broader industry challenges. Reckitt CEO Narasimhan said Carr, 58, had a record of building strong teams and capital allocation discipline. Carr, who began his career at Anglo-Dutch firm Unilever () and has held senior roles at companies including AB Foods () and easyJet (), will take over in April from Hennah, who will stay on until October 2020.  Carr would take over in April from Hennah, who will stay on until October 2020, completing seven years as CFO.     Reckitt said Carr be paid 680,000 pounds ($882,776) and have a pension allowance of 10% of his salary, as well as other benefits.  Reckitt is due to report third quarter results on Tuesday.

Negative rates forever? Central bankers look for an exit,Oct 20 2019,"WASHINGTON () - The world's most powerful policymakers are struggling to alleviate the pain of a slowing global economy with few levers left to pull and growing concern that one of them, negative interest rates, already is creating problems of its own. In an ideal world, elected officials would pull more of the weight with fiscal programs and structural reforms that would improve growth and allow interest rates to rise. But over three days of conversation here, the dilemma has become clear: Whether it is the U.S.-China trade war, tightfisted spending in Germany, or the drawn-out Brexit, broader government policies are moving in the other direction - driving central bankers to mount further rescue efforts, and likely leading to even more negative yielding debt.   “We still have tools which could be used as necessary,” said Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda. “I don't think the effect of monetary policy has declined significantly or materially.” Still, Kuroda said that a prolonged low interest rate situation could have “side effects on the financial system. You have to be careful.” Negative interest rates are now a fact of life in Europe and Japan, and multiple other countries including the United States are lowering their target policy rates. “It is not really clear how we are going to get out of this,” Stanford University economics professor John Taylor said at a meeting of the Institute of International Finance. He spoke at a central banking panel that showed just how much the landscape has shifted in the decade since the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis. Far from debate over whether unconventional policies are appropriate or not, the discussion is now about whether traditional central banking can even survive - or whether oddities like negative rates have become self-reenforcing, and whether central banks will need to begin overtly financing government programs to get the fiscal spending that may provide an exit from them. “We have got to make it easier for politicians to run fiscal policy when monetary policy is essentially not operating well,” said former Federal Reserve vice chair Stanley Fischer, now a senior adviser with investment management firm BlackRock. Conversation at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings this week was dominated by two concerns - a global economic slowdown driven by “policy shocks” that might have been avoided, and the risks to pension funds, banks, and overall financial stability posed by the roughly $15 trillion, estimated by the IMF, in bonds that now pay a negative interest rate.  With easier monetary policy being used to dampen the impact of the trade war and other risks, some analysts worry about the moral hazard of central bankers underwriting the very policies they feel are slowing growth. “There is a kind of benign view that central banks are just kind of doing their best to offset the damage done by one set of policymakers in one side of the government,” said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. “There is a real danger in misplaced faith in the capacity of central banks to fix all these growth challenges.” Yet they may have no choice.    IMF economists slashed their forecasts for global growth to the slowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, ahead of the conference, setting the tone for a somber mood. In a communique issued on Saturday, the IMF's steering committee said member countries should “employ all appropriate policy tools, individually and collectively, to mitigate risks.” With interest rates close to or below zero, asset purchases are now the main policy tool for some central banks. The ECB, for example, has cut its key rate to a record low of minus 0.5% and launched an indefinite bond buying program that will likely keep it in the market for years to come.  “The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside,” outgoing ECB President Mario Draghi said at the IMF meeting on Friday. “The Governing Council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments.” Beyond the euro zone, the United States and Japan, other nations are also easing rates. The Russian central bank, which has been cutting rates this year as economic growth slowed and inflation waned, will be ready to act “more decisively” when cutting interest rates, Governor Elvira Nabiullina said. Ukraine central bank Deputy Governor Kateryna Rozhkova said the bank intends to cut the key policy rate gradually.  While lower rates support growth, the consequence of ultra-accommodative policy is that it can breed higher risk taking, as investors search for yield, said experts.   “We do worry about the side effect, which is that investors are reaching for yield,” said Tobias Adrian, financial counselor and director of the IMF's monetary and capital markets department. “That is ultimately what is driving high yield bonds into negative territory in some parts of the world.”  Adrian pointed to leverage rising in the corporate sector and said the IMF saw stretched valuations in some equity markets, many corporate bond markets, and government bond markets around the world. Negative interest rates may be hiding “deep underlying problems,” said Ásgeir Jónsson, governor of the Central Bank of Iceland. They're a “sign of sickness for developed economies.” ","{'neg': 0.107, 'neu': 0.784, 'pos': 0.109, 'compound': -0.0422}",-0.0422
"Indonesian president taps opposition rival, tech CEO for reform cabinet",Oct 21 2019,"JAKARTA () - Indonesian President Joko Widodo asked opposition leader Prabowo Subianto on Monday to join his new cabinet for a second term, while the co-founder of tech start-up Gojek and a former chairman of Inter Milan soccer club were also tapped for posts.  Bringing on board Prabowo, who was Widodo's challenger in April's bitterly fought election, means the president can further strengthen his grip on parliament as he seeks to push through his reform agenda. The retired general's Gerindra party has the third most seats in the lower house. The make-up of the cabinet was being closely watched to see how many technocrats - who are more likely to fall in with Widodo's plans for boosting growth and investment - were included. Widodo had been expected to announce his full cabinet line-up on Monday, but this had been delayed until Wednesday, officials said. “I want appointed ministers to be figures who are innovative, productive, as well as be hard and fast workers. Figures who are not stuck in monotonous routines,” Widodo said in a Twitter message. A series of candidates visiting the presidential palace on Monday said Widodo had asked them to join the cabinet, but they declined to confirm the positions offered. Prabowo, 68, said after meeting the president he had been asked to help in the defense sector. Media reports have suggested he would serve as defense minister. His cabinet inclusion comes after he had initially refused to concede defeat in April's vote, going to the constitutional court citing systematic fraud and abuse of power. But after the court ruled against him the former special forces commander met Widodo on a number of occasions, including during a well-publicised ride on Jakarta's new subway system. Indonesian political parties tend to be divided more by the rival personalities at the helm rather than ideology, meaning they can more easily switch allegiances to get into power.  Nadiem Makarim, 35, the chief executive of Indonesian ride-hailing and payments firm Gojek, was another visitor at the palace.  “I have received a big honor to be able to join the cabinet of the president,” Makarim told reporters.  He has been linked to a possible post in a new digital economy ministry or in education. Gojek said the company's president Andre Soelistyo and its co-founder Kevin Aluwi would take over the leadership of the $10 billion unicorn.  Widodo's election campaign manager Erick Thohir, 49, the  chairman of media business Mahaka Media was also  interviewed for a post, sending shares in his company up 19%. Thohir, a former chairman of Italian soccer club Inter Milan who also has stakes in basketball teams, successfully led the team organizing the Asian Games hosted by Indonesia last year.  The billionaire businessman said he would step down from his company if appointed, noting the president had asked candidates to sign “an integrity pact” to avoid conflict of interests. Widodo has been besieged by “extremely intense” jockeying for posts as he sought to build a cabinet of technocrat ministers, a presidential adviser has said, declining to be named. While analysts welcomed some of the private sector picks, Arya Fernandes at the Jakarta-based Center for Strategic and International Studies cautioned that too many political appointments could undermine the cabinet's effectiveness. On Sunday, Widodo said around 16 ministers in the new cabinet would come from parties out of an anticipated 34 posts. Widodo, 58, has pledged to cut red tape and keep building infrastructure to underpin growth in Southeast Asia's largest economy, but also made improving education a top priority to encourage investment and create jobs for a youthful population of 260 million people. Airlangga Hartarto, the current industry minister and chairman of political party Golkar, was among a string of potential candidates meeting the president at the palace. He said he had discussed how to narrow Indonesia's trade deficit, without elaborating on any role. He has been linked in media to the job of coordinating minister for economic affairs.

"2020 hopeful Warren would quadruple school funding, crack down on charters",Oct 21 2019,"WASHINGTON () - White House hopeful Elizabeth Warren said on Monday that if elected she would roughly quadruple federal funding for public schools and incentivize states to adopt funding approaches that more equitably fund lower-income schools. Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts who is now a front-runner for the Democratic Party's 2020 presidential nomination along with former Vice President Joe Biden, wrote in a post on the website Medium that her plan would result in the federal government investing an additional $450 billion in elementary and secondary schools over the next decade. “Our current approach to school funding at the federal, state, and local level underfunds our schools and results in many students from low-income backgrounds receiving less funding,” Warren wrote. “My plan makes a historic new federal investment in public schools - and pushes both the federal government and state governments to dedicate more resources to the schools and students that need them most.” In the United States, state and local governments fund about 90% of public primary and secondary education, with the federal government providing the remaining 10% primarily through the “Title I” program.  Warren said she would quadruple Title I funding over the next 10 years. She would also predicate access to additional Title I funds on states adopting school funding schemes that are not reliant on property taxes, which benefit schools in higher-income areas. She would also invest an additional $50 billion in improving infrastructure at the schools most in need of upgrades. The increase in Title I funding, which would be financed by Warren's proposal for a 2% wealth tax on household assets beyond $50 million, would also cover an increase in teacher pay that she frequently mentions on the campaign trail.  Warren wrote that she would “push to cancel all existing student meal debt” and allot more money to the free school meals program. She would also push to prohibit the use of standardized testing as a significant factor in firing teachers, closing schools and other major decisions.  Warren would also impose transparency requirements on privately operated public charter schools and end federal funding for the creation of new charter schools, saying the Federal Charter School Program is an “abject failure,” with many schools under investigation by regulators. She would ban for-profit charter schools outright and direct the Internal Revenue Service to investigate nonprofit charters that are run by for-profit entities or operate with the assistance of for-profit service providers.

Wirecard hires KPMG for independent audit after FT allegations,Oct 21 2019,"FRANKFURT/BERLIN () - German payments company Wirecard has hired KPMG to conduct an independent audit to address allegations by the Financial Times that its finance team had sought to inflate reported sales and profits, it said on Monday. The company, promoted to the DAX blue-chip index last year, has been the target of a series of investigative reports by FT reporter Dan McCrum, with the latest, on Oct. 15, knocking more than 20% off its share price. It has rejected the newspaper's allegations, based on internal spreadsheets and correspondence, that Wirecard's senior finance team had sought to inflate reported sales and profits at its businesses in Dubai and Ireland. Monday's announcement drove the company's shares up by 8%. “This is an active strategic step. The allegations are old, we have investigated them and found them to be completely baseless,” CEO Markus Braun told  on Monday. “The independent examination by KPMG should lay to rest any remaining speculation and give fresh confidence to the market. We intend to present the results as soon as possible.” Following the FT's latest reporting, the company has faced growing calls from investors and corporate governance advocates for such an outside audit - both to clear up the matter and show that Wirecard meets the governance standards of a top-tier public company. “We have complete confidence in the audit procedures performed to date and their results. We assume this renewed independent review will lead to a final end to all further speculation,” Wulf Matthias, Wirecard supervisory board chairman, said in a statement earlier. The audit will begin immediately, Wirecard said, adding that KPMG would report to the company's supervisory board and have unrestricted access to information at all levels of the group. Thomas Eichelmann, chairman of the audit committee of Wirecard's supervisory board and a former chief financial officer of Deutsche Boerse AG, will support the audit on behalf of Wirecard. Wirecard has long been a favorite target of short sellers, or speculators who seek to profit from the airing of negative information that drives down a company's share price. It has accused the FT and reporter McCrum of colluding with short sellers, as well as suing the newspaper. Financial Times Editor Lionel Barber has said an investigation by an outside law firm found no evidence to support those claims. In-house auditor EY signed off on Wirecard's 2018 accounts in April after an earlier FT story alleged fraud and false accounting at the company's Singapore office. An investigation by an outside law firm found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by head office, although Singapore staff may have broken local laws, Wirecard said at the time. Separately, German prosecutors are investigating a group of individuals on suspicion of manipulating Wirecard stock, acting on evidence provided by financial market regulator Bafin.

What happens next after UK PM Johnson writes Brexit delay letter?,Oct 21 2019,"LONDON () - Prime Minister Boris Johnson will try again to get his Brexit deal passed by parliament on Monday after lawmakers decided to delay their agreement, a humiliating blow for a leader who has staked his reputation on leaving on Oct. 31. On Saturday, Johnson was forced to send a letter to the European Union seeking an extension to his “do or die” deadline of the end of October, but the British leader also sent another one to argue against what he called a “deeply corrosive” delay. After more than three years of negotiations, it is unclear as to how, whether or when a deeply divided Britain will leave the bloc, more than 40 years after the country joined the project built out of the ruins left by World War Two. Following is a rough guide to what could happen next: Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the lower house of parliament, or House of Commons, said on Saturday the government planned to put Johnson's exit deal to a debate and vote on Monday. But the speaker of the House, John Bercow, said he would rule whether that would be allowed after several lawmakers said it would break with parliamentary convention that the same question cannot be put twice during the same session. His statement should come at around 1430 GMT. “I have been blindsided on this matter, as others have been,” Bercow told parliament after Rees-Mogg's announcement.  “I will reflect on the matter, absorbing what colleagues say and consulting others for their advice, and I will report to the House on Monday,” he added. “The government are not the arbiter of what is orderly.” If there is a vote, it could come much later in the day. Scotland's highest court, the Court of Session, is due to consider on Monday a legal challenge that sought to force Johnson to comply with the so-called Benn Act. That was the law which required him to write the extension letter if parliament had not approved either a deal or a no-deal exit by Oct. 19. Anti-Brexit campaigners had asked the court earlier this month for it either to issue an order forcing Johnson to ask for a delay or for it to instruct that a letter be sent to the EU on his behalf if he refused.  The campaigners also said he should face penalties including a fine or even prison if he did not comply with the Benn Act. Opposition lawmakers said by writing two letters, Johnson had broken his government's pledge to the court not to frustrate the legislation. But on Sunday, anti-Brexit campaigners said they would ask the court to delay its ruling on the challenge. “What I and ... the other petitioners have instructed our lawyers to do is to seek a continuation of the case until the end of the week to keep a watching brief over matters,” Scottish National Party lawmaker Joanna Cherry told ITV. “We don't want the focus to be all on the court case. We want the focus to be on what is happening in Brussels, the negotiation for an extension.” The court, has not yet ruled on the matter and was waiting to do so pending developments up to Oct. 19. But it said this month that government lawyers had given formal legal statements - averments - that he would abide by the Benn Act and it would be a serious matter if he did not. TUESDAY - BREXIT LEGISLATION? Johnson told parliament that “next week the government will introduce the legislation needed for us to leave the EU with our new deal on October 31”. It is widely expected to have its first main stage of debate on Tuesday. Senior minister Michael Gove said on Sunday the government would seek to get the legislation required through parliament in order to get Brexit done and leave the EU on Oct. 31. Gove and foreign minister Dominic Raab said they believed the government had the numbers to pass a deal. Former minister Amber Rudd, who quit the government over Johnson's willingness to pursue a no-deal Brexit, said she and most of the 21 Conservative lawmakers who were kicked out of the parliamentary party for backing attempts to block a no-deal exit, would support the legislation. “He has a fragile but sincere coalition of people who want to support it,” she told Sky News. Lawmakers will have the opportunity to bring changes to the legislation and Labour Brexit policy chief Keir Starmer and finance spokesman John McDonnell said on Sunday the party would put forward amendments including on issues such as protecting worker's rights and closing the “trap door” to a no-deal Brexit at the end of a transition period in December 2020. Changes proposed by lawmakers are also likely to include adding a customs union with the EU to the deal and the need for a confirmatory referendum on the agreement. Johnson has ruled out a customs union and, on Monday, a lawmaker from the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, which has propped up the government, said it would not support such a proposal. A confirmatory referendum would throw open the possibility of Brexit not even happening -  although it is not clear whether there would be sufficient numbers among lawmakers to back such a plan.     The chairman of European Union leaders, Donald Tusk, said on Saturday he had received the extension request and he would now be consulting with EU capitals on how to react. After a short meeting on Sunday, diplomats with the bloc said the EU would play for time rather than rush to decide on the delay request. “We're looking for more clarity toward the end of the week, hoping that by that time we will also see how things develop in London,” one senior EU diplomat said. Leaders of the 27 states that will make up the EU once Britain leaves are unlikely to deny the extension request. Gove said the EU was “waiting to see what parliament does now”.  “We'll have an opportunity in the days ahead to consider the legislation that allows us to leave the European Union. If people vote for that legislation ... then we can leave and we can leave in time,” he said. Both the governing Conservatives and main opposition Labour Party say they want a new election, but Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he will not back any move to hold one until a no-deal Brexit is ruled out. “An election is inevitable because of the numbers in parliament, because we have got to break the impasse, the timing will be a matter for Jeremy Corbyn ... but it is inevitable that sooner or later this breaks into a general election,” said Starmer.

RPT-UPDATE 1-Fallout from Trump's trade wars felt by economies around the world,Oct 21 2019,"(Repeats story first published on Saturday) By Andrea Shalal and Heather Timmons WASHINGTON, Oct 19 () - The collateral damage of the United States' trade wars is being felt from the fjords of Iceland to the auto factories of Japan. Central bank governors and finance ministers traded grim tales of suffering economies at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank fall meetings in Washington this week. Some also noted how far U.S. policy had shifted from the 1940s, when Washington co-founded the IMF. At that time, “the world economy had been hammered for over a decade by high tariff barriers, depression and war,” prompting then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau to champion a global economic system, World Bank President David Malpass told attendees at a session this week. The U.S. message then, Malpass said, was: “First, there's no limit to prosperity. Second, broadly shared prosperity benefits everyone.” As the IMF's gathering of 189 member-nations drew to a close, the unintended negative impacts of the trade wars were becoming clear, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said. “Everybody loses.” The United States, the world's largest importer, started a bitter tariff war with China, the world's largest exporter, 15 months ago. U.S. President Donald Trump is also in the midst of renegotiating, and sometimes upending, trade relationships with many of Washington's top trading partners. The fallout will slow global growth in 2019 to 3.0%, the slowest pace in a decade, the IMF estimated this week. This pain is not being shared equally. The United States remains the least exposed of the world's 20 largest economies to a drop in exports in part because of its massive domestic consumer spending base. (Here's a graphic that shows the impact of tariffs in the United States and around the world. ) The damage is being particularly felt in European countries which “rely on exports and are open to trade,” the European Union's Economic and Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said. More than 40% of Germany's GDP was derived from exports in 2018, the most of any major global economy. Uncertainty in the business community is widespread, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told reporters. German trade group BGA recently revised down its growth forecast for German exports in 2019 to just 0.5%, from 1.5%. As a result, many companies are scaling back their investment plans, something that will have repercussions for years to come. Scholz said concerns over Britain's impending departure from the EU and the bloc's trade dispute with the United States were clearly dampening global economic growth. “The most important problem remains those factors that we cannot measure – specifically the reluctance to invest,” Scholz said. The pain is being felt in countries that don't rely on exports too, such as Iceland, which became the first developed economy to seek aid from the IMF after a 2008 banking collapse. Since then, it has rebuilt its economy in what's been called a miraculous recovery. Now, that is threatened. “We have become dependent on tourism,” explained Ásgeir Jónsson, the governor of Iceland's central bank, with annual visitors growing five-fold to 2.5 million since the crisis. Foreign arrivals, however, have plummeted since the trade wars started, and are down 15.6% this summer from the year before. Iceland, with a population of about 300,000, built foreign currency reserves on the back of the increase in visitors, he said, but those are dropping too. Trade links between countries have led to a more peaceful world in recent decades, but recent experience shows “you can never take global trade for granted,” Jónsson said. On Friday, Japan's Cabinet Office, which helps coordinate government policy, downgraded its assessment of factory output in October. The softness in production was largely due to car exports to the United States turning weaker, after growing steadily until the spring, a government official said at a briefing. “The pick-up in global growth is being delayed,” Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said. “Japan's economy is seeing exports weaken significantly and that's affecting factory output.” The United States hasn't been immune from the impact of the trade wars. American farmers have been particularly hurt by Chinese tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, prompting the Trump administration to give billions in aid to the farm belt. Washington's imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs and uncertainty about passage of a new North American free trade deal - the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement - have also stalled local economic development. Christopher Cabaldon, the mayor of West Sacramento, California, said bids for a $100 million infrastructure project in the city came in 80% higher than expected in part because of construction firms' need to factor in higher costs and the risk of additional tariffs in the future. “Even in small cities like my own, we see the impacts of trade. We have come to realize the deep integration of our local economies in the global system,” Cabaldon told  ahead of the IMF and World Bank meetings. “Most of my economic development plans ... are playing out on a global stage, not down the freeway.” The trade tensions are helping to spur a push among African nations to create a more self-reliant continent. “We must take it upon ourselves to grow trade among ourselves,” said Ukur Yatani Kanacho, Kenya's acting cabinet secretary for treasury. Abdoulaye Daouda Diallo, the finance minister of Senegal, told reporters the U.S.-China trade tensions would affect African nations in the energy sector and cut funds available on financial markets. The dispute underscored the importance of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, he said. Other emerging markets are also coming under pressure. “Ukrainian exporters faced worsened conditions in global commodity markets,” which drove down steel prices, said Kateryna Rozhkova, the deputy governor of the country's central bank. Making matters worse, “the intensification of geopolitical conflicts led to rising oil and natural gas prices in the world,” she said. Bahrain's Finance Minister Sheikh Salman bin Khalifa Al Khalifa said the Gulf region was also affected by trade tensions and the resulting slowdown in investment, although geopolitical concerns – about Iran, for example – were another major factor. “Trade tensions create uncertainty and nobody is insulated from uncertainty,” he told . Peru cut its 2019 economic growth estimate to 3% in August, from 4.2%, citing trade factors. Mexico is edging closer to a recession that its officials say might be more difficult to reverse than during the last downturn more than a decade ago. “The Great Recession basically caught everybody by surprise, but economies were willing to cooperate and work together to pull it out,” Mexican Finance Minister Arturo Herrera said. “This slowdown is taking nobody by surprise, but there is very little appetite for cooperation.” ","{'neg': 0.1, 'neu': 0.806, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': -0.8794}",-0.8794
France may yet pursue 100% renewable power strategy: minister,Oct 21 2019,"PARIS () - France has yet to decide whether to build new nuclear reactors and could yet pursue a long-term strategy of 100% renewable energy, Environment Minister Elisabeth Borne said on Monday. The minister was responding to questions on Europe 1 radio after the CEO of state-controled power utility EDF last week said it is clear France is preparing to build new reactors. EDF operates all of France's 58 nuclear reactors, which account for more than 75% of the country's electricity needs. “EDF does not determine French energy policy,” Borne said, pointing to France's previously announced policy on reducing the nuclear power to 50% of the electricity mix by 2035 while increasing the contribution of renewables. “The decision on new reactors has not been made. There are different scenarios with new nuclear reactors in the mix. We are also looking at a scenario where we have 100% renewables,” Borne said. Borne also said that President Emmanuel Macron has reiterated that there will be no decision on new reactors until the commissioning of EDF's Flamanville 3 EPR reactor under construction in the north of France. Her comments follow a report on the Le Monde website last week, in which Borne and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire were said to have sent a letter to EDF asking the company to prepare plans for the construction of six EPR nuclear reactors over the next 15 years. The Flamanville 3 reactor - the latest generation of reactor with enhanced safety features put in place after the Fukushima nuclear meltdown in Japan - has been plagued by delays, technical problems and cost overruns. It is now expected to start operating in 2023, more than a decade behind schedule. “What we expect from EDF is an explanation on the cost overruns and delays at Flamanville 3,” Borne added.

Ex-CEOs to plead guilty to roles in U.S. college admissions scandal,Oct 21 2019,"BOSTON, Oct 21 () - Three wealthy parents including the former chief executives of bond manager Pimco and specialty finance lender Hercules Capital Inc will appear in court on Monday to plead guilty to participating in a vast U.S. college admissions cheating and fraud scheme. Federal prosecutors in Boston allege that ex-Pimco CEO Douglas Hodge, Hercules Capital founder Manuel Henriquez and onetime food manufacturer executive Michelle Janavs paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to have their children admitted to universities as fake athletic recruits. They are among 52 people charged with participating in a vast scheme in which wealthy parents conspired with a California college admissions consultant to use bribery and other forms of fraud to secure the admission of their children to top schools. William “Rick” Singer, the consultant, pleaded guilty in March to charges he facilitated cheating on college entrance exams and helped bribe sports coaches at universities to present his clients' children as fake athletic recruits. The 35 parents charged in the investigation include executives and celebrities, such as “Desperate Housewives” star Felicity Huffman and “Full House” actress Lori Loughlin. Huffman reported to prison last week to serve a 14-day term after admitting she engaged in the college exam cheating scheme. Loughlin has pleaded not guilty. Hodge was CEO of Allianz SE's Pimco, the world's largest bond manager, from 2014 to 2016. Prior to his arrest in March, Henriquez was chairman and CEO of Palo Alto, California-based Hercules. Janavs was formerly an executive at her family's food manufacturing company Chef America, which produced the microwavable snack Hot Pockets before being bought by Nestle for $2.6 billion in 2002. Prosecutors alleged that Hodge paid $525,000 to facilitate the admission of his daughter and son to the University of Southern California as soccer and football recruits through the use of bribery and falsified athletic profiles. Henriquez and his wife turned to Singer to help fraudulently inflate their two daughters' entrance exam scores and also paid him $400,000 to bribe a tennis coach to help their oldest gain admission to Georgetown University, prosecutors alleged. Janavs similarly conspired with Singer to pay $600,000 to facilitate her son's admission to Georgetown as a fake tennis recruit and her older daughter's admission to USC as a volleyball recruit, according to an indictment. She also paid Singer $100,000 to have a corrupt exam proctor to secretly correct her two daughters' answers on the ACT exam, prosecutors said.

"Gojek CEO quits to join Indonesian cabinet, replacements named",Oct 21 2019,"JAKARTA () - Gojek CEO and co-founder Nadiem Makarim said on Monday he had resigned to join Indonesia's new cabinet, and the ride-hailing and payments company said two senior executives would jointly take over running operations of the $10 billion firm. President Andre Soelistyo and the other co-founder Kevin Aluwi would be the joint CEOs, Gojek said. It noted in a statement it had “planned for this possibility and there would no disruption to our business.”  Makarim, 35 and a graduate of Brown University and Harvard Business School, told reporters at the presidential palace in Jakarta it was a “a big honor to be able to join the cabinet.”  He said his specific role would be announced by President Joko Widodo later in the week. Some economic analysts said they were surprised by Makarim's departure, which comes in the heat of Gojek's battle with Singapore-based rival Grab. Its biggest shareholder Softbank said in July it will invest $2 billion in Indonesia through Grab, taking on Gojek in its home market. Having evolved from a ride-hailing service founded in 2010 to a one-stop app via which users can make online payments and order food and services such as massages, Gojek is now targeting a larger slice of the Southeast Asian market, where Grab currently dominates ride-sharing. Outside Indonesia, where it recently launched a “Netflix” style video-streaming service, Gojek has also expanded to Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines. An expansion to Malaysia is planned. “We will make an announcement on what this news means for Gojek within the next few days,” the company said, referring to Makarim, who has been the face of the tech startup. The Indonesian company, valued at $10 billion, raised over $1 billion earlier this year from backers including Alphabet's Google () and Chinese tech giants Tencent () and JD ().  Google, which has invested $500 million in Gojek, declined to comment on Makarim's departure, while Tencent and JD did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A senior executive at a private equity investor in Gojek said it was a positive move. “Nadiem has been the face of the company but for all practical purposes, the people behind the operations and financing have been Kevin and Andre,” the executive said, declining to be identified further. “Investors have been kept informed of the potential changes and net, net, I think this is a positive move for GoJek.” Makarim said he and Widodo had spoken about “directions to develop Indonesia in the future” including in “human capital, bureaucratic reform, and investment.” Indonesia media have linked Makarim, from a prominent Jakarta family, to a possible cabinet post in a new digital economy ministry or in education. Makarim's grandfather was an figure in the country's freedom movement and a member of parliament. The announcement was welcomed by investors and analysts as a signal Widodo would focus on developing Indonesia's booming technology sector.  The Indonesian leader has repeatedly pledged to invest in bridging the acute skills shortage faced by the country's startups. While Indonesia's Internet economy is forecast to grow to over $100 billion by 2025, it produces only 278 engineers per million people a year, according to consultancy A.T. Kearney. “Gojek is one of the most valuable unicorns in the region but much can be done at the national level as tech entrepreneurs continue to face challenges in terms of regulations, infrastructure and lack of IT talent in the region,” said Winston Cheng, a former international president of Chinese e-commerce giant and Gojek backer JD.com (), who was a Gojek board member until 2018. “Having an industry leader such as Nadiem in a tech and education related government role would bridge the gap between public policy and industry to accelerate the development of the tech industry in the region,” he added. Gojek is one of Indonesia's five unicorns - companies that have reached $1 billion in valuation without tapping the stock markets.  The others are travel site Traveloka, market places Bukalapak and Tokopedia, and Grab-backed fintech firm OVO, which competes with Gojek's own payments platform Gopay for the top spot in Indonesia's multi-billion dollar online payments market.

Lebanon set to cut ministers' pay as protests engulf country,Oct 21 2019,"* Cabinet meeting to approve reforms * Reforms include halving current and ex politicians' pay * Protests have spread across country in past days By Ellen Francis BEIRUT, Oct 21 () - Lebanon's cabinet is expected to approve reforms including halving ministers' wages on Monday in a bid to ease an economic crisis and defuse protests that have been the biggest show of dissent against the ruling elite in decades. Protesters blocked roads for a fifth day of demonstrations fuelled by the crippling economic conditions and anger at perceived corruption of the political elite that has led Lebanon into the crisis. Officials told  on Sunday that Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri had agreed a package of reforms with his government partners to tackle the crisis that has driven hundreds of thousands of protesters into the streets. The government is due to meet at 10:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) at the presidential palace in the Beirut suburb of Baabda. In central Beirut, scene of the largest protest, people prepared for another day of demonstrations. “If we get reforms, for a start it's good, to calm down the storms, people are angry ... but on the long term, I don't know if it will make a change,” said Rida Jammoul, football coach, who was helping to clean-up in Beirut. Another protester, Ziad Abou Chakra, said he would continue to protest until the government was toppled. “We will stay here and we won't open the roads whatever happens,” he said, manning a road block in the Zouk Mikhael area north of Beriut. The reform plan includes a 50% cut in salaries of current and former presidents, ministers and lawmakers, as well as reductions in benefits for state institutions and officials. It also includes the central bank and private banks contributing $3.3 billion to achieve a “near zero deficit” for the 2020 budget. The government also aims to privatise the telecommunications sector and overhaul the costly and crumbling electricity sector, one of the biggest strains on Lebanon's depleted finances. Hariri, who leads a coalition cabinet mired in sectarian and political rivalries, gave his feuding government a 72-hour deadline on Friday to agree reforms to ward off crisis, hinting he might otherwise resign. The deadline expires on Monday. A chorus of voices, from union leaders to politicians, has joined calls for Hariri's government to resign. The protests have spread across the country since Thursday. Banks were closed on Monday and the main labour union went on strike, threatening further paralysis. “The message to the politicians is don't ever underestimate the power of the people because once they unite they will explode - peacefully,” said Hiba Dandachli, 36, a social entrepreneur who was helping to organise the clean-up.

"China September home price growth flatlines, fewer cities see price gains",Oct 21 2019,"BEIJING () - New home prices in China grew at a steady pace in September, with fewer cities reporting price gains, a relief for policymakers who remain wary of high debt and bubble risk and are refraining from stimulating the sector as the economy cools. The property sector has held up as one of the few bright spots in the world's second-largest economy with other parts hit as factories struggle to land new orders from abroad amid Beijing's bruising trade war with the United States.      Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.5% in September from August, when it also grew at the same pace -the slowest since February,  calculated based on National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data on Monday. Home prices in September rose 8.4% from a year earlier, slowing from an 8.8% gain in August, and the slowest since September last year. “A broad trend of slowdown in property price growth is emerging,” said Zhang Dawei, an analyst with property agency Centaline. Chinese regulators have vowed to refrain from stimulating the property sector as rapidly-growing household debt and rising home prices have deepened fears about a sudden market correction and concerns over housing affordability. Property prices increased for the 53rd straight month. Most of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS still reported monthly price increases for new homes in September, though the number was down to 53 from 55 in August. Slower price gains are partly due to developers cutting prices to attract buyers in September just ahead of the week-long National Day holiday, a peak sales season, said Yan Yuejin, director of the Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institution. On Monday, the central bank surprised markets by keeping the new benchmark lending rate unchanged, suggesting Beijing is keen to avoid overly loosening monetary policy for fear it may push up already-high debt levels across the economy. “To balance short-term growth stability against long-term financial risks, it has become increasingly evident that Beijing's new master plan features ‘no flood of credit' and targeted monetary easing that excludes the property sector,” Nomura analysts wrote in a note last Friday.   The government has clamped down on speculative investment in the housing market since 2016 to prevent a sharp correction as prices soared. But Beijing has been careful to tread its policy line to defuse risk without triggering a market collapse.  As local governments are given more autonomy in policymaking, price trends have been mixed, with some cities showing signs of rapid cooling while others are still plagued with overheating risks. Some analysts have pointed to upside risks in some markets where regional governments have rushed to make it easier for out-of-towners to obtain local residency under the household registration system, which will allow them to overcome existing home purchase curbs on outside speculators. Nanning, a city in southern China near the border with Vietnam, was the top price performer in the month, with prices increasing 2.1% on a monthly basis. Centaline's Zhang noted “whack-a-mole” style tightening measures will likely continue at the city level, but if price trends start to falter, some loosening measures will also be introduced to cushion the economy. “A price spike does not spell ‘stability', neither does a drastic fall,” he said. While property investment stayed buoyant in September boosted by a rise in new construction activity, growth in property transactions slowed during what is traditionally China's “Golden September” peak season for new home sales. Sales were hurt by persistent pressures in the sector as a crackdown on speculators showed little signs of abating. Economists noted some developers will likely ramp up sales promotion and slash prices towards the year-end to bolster their performance and secure revenues, though any sharp drop in home prices will not be tolerated by local governments.  “The current pace of construction is not sustainable given underlying housing demand. Developers are now slowing the launch of new projects in response to tighter access to financing and subdued sales,” analysts at Capital Economics said in a recent note.   Beijing has been clamping down on domestic and onshore financing for the sector, and kept down-payment requirements high for individual buyers in major markets. More recently, Chinese regulators have stepped up efforts to  press banks to raise mortgage rates and rein in mortgage lending amid concerns about property prices and rising household debt. Moody's said financially weak developers will face increased refinancing risks, although most rated Chinese developers will still maintain adequate liquidity despite tighter financing control.

Explainer: What happens next after UK PM Johnson writes Brexit delay letter?,Oct 20 2019,"LONDON () - Prime Minister Boris Johnson has sent an unsigned letter to the European Union requesting a delay to Britain's exit from the bloc, as well as a second note saying he did not want a “deeply corrosive” Brexit extension. Johnson was required by law to send the first letter, after parliament voted on Saturday to withhold its approval of his Brexit deal until it has passed legislation to formally ratify the agreement. Following is a rough guide to what could happen next: Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the lower house of parliament, or House of Commons, said on Saturday the government planned to put Johnson's exit deal to a debate and vote on Monday. But the speaker of the House, John Bercow, said he would rule whether that would be allowed after several lawmakers said it would break with parliamentary convention that the same question cannot be put twice during the same session. “I have been blindsided on this matter, as others have been,” Bercow told parliament after Rees-Mogg's announcement.  “I will reflect on the matter, absorbing what colleagues say and consulting others for their advice, and I will report to the House on Monday,” he added. “The government are not the arbiter of what is orderly.” Scotland's highest court, the Court of Session, is due to consider on Monday a legal challenge that sought to force Johnson to comply with the so-called Benn Act. That was the law which required him to write the extension letter if parliament had not approved either a deal or a no-deal exit by Oct. 19. Anti-Brexit campaigners had asked the court earlier this month for it either to issue an order forcing Johnson to ask for a delay or for it to instruct that a letter be sent to the EU on his behalf if he refused.  The campaigners also said he should face penalties including a fine or even prison if he did not comply with the Benn Act. The court, has not yet ruled on the matter and was waiting to do so pending developments up to Oct. 19. But it said this month that government lawyers had given formal legal statements - averments - that he would abide by the Benn Act and it would be a serious matter if he did not. “It would be destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the crown for the prime minister or the government to renege on what they have assured the court that the prime minister intends to do,” judge Paul Cullen, known as Lord Pentland, said. Opposition lawmakers said that by writing two letters, Johnson had broken his government's pledge to the court not to frustrate the legislation. “He may well be in contempt of parliament or the courts themselves because he's clearly trying to undermine the first letter,” Labour's finance spokesman John McDonnell told Sky News. Labour's Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer told BBC television Johnson was “being childlike”, adding “I am sure there will be court proceedings”.   Johnson told parliament that “next week the government will introduce the legislation needed for us to leave the EU with our new deal on October 31”. It is widely expected to have its first main stage of debate on Tuesday. Senior minister Michael Gove said on Sunday the government would seek to get the legislation required through parliament in order to get Brexit done and leave the EU on Oct. 31. Gove and foreign minister Dominic Raab said they believed the government had the numbers to pass a deal. Former minister Amber Rudd, who quit the government over Johnson's willingness to pursue a no-deal Brexit, said she and most of the 21 Conservative lawmakers who were kicked out of the parliamentary party for backing attempts to block a no-deal exit, would support the legislation. “He has a fragile but sincere coalition of people who want to support it,” she told Sky News. Lawmakers will have the opportunity to bring changes to the legislation and Labour's Starmer and McDonnell said on Sunday the party would put forward amendments including on issues such as protecting worker's rights and closing the “trap door” to a no-deal Brexit at the end of a transition period in December 2020. Changes proposed by lawmakers are also likely to include the need for a confirmatory referendum on the agreement. That would throw open the possibility of Brexit not even happening -  although it is not clear whether there would be sufficient numbers among lawmakers to back such a plan.     The chairman of European Union leaders, Donald Tusk, said on Saturday he had received the extension request and he would now be consulting with EU capitals on how to react. After a short meeting on Sunday, diplomats with the bloc said the EU would play for time rather than rush to decide on the delay request. “We're looking for more clarity towards the end of the week, hoping that by that time we will also see how things develop in London,” one senior EU diplomat said. Leaders of the 27 states that will make up the EU once Britain leaves are unlikely to deny the extension request. Gove said the EU was “waiting to see what parliament does now”.  “We'll have an opportunity in the days ahead to consider the legislation that allows us to leave the European Union. If people vote for that legislation (..) then we can leave and we can leave in time,” he said. Both the governing Conservatives and main opposition Labour Party say they want a new election, but Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he will not back any move to hold one until a no-deal Brexit is ruled out. “An election is inevitable because of the numbers in parliament, because we have got to break the impasse, the timing will be a matter for Jeremy Corbyn ... but it is inevitable that sooner or later this breaks into a general election,” said Starmer.

Lebanon's Hariri agrees to reforms amid nationwide protests over economic crisis,Oct 20 2019,"BEIRUT () - Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri agreed on Sunday a package of reforms with government partners to ease an economic crisis that has sparked protests aimed at ousting a ruling elite seen as riddled with corruption and cronyism. Officials told  the agreement was reached as hundreds of thousands of protesters flooded the streets for a fourth day in the biggest show of dissent against the establishment in decades. A sea of people, some waving Lebanese flags, called for revolution in protests that resembled the 2011 Arab revolts that toppled four presidents. Hariri, who is leading a coalition government mired by sectarian and political rivalries, gave his feuding government partners a 72-hour deadline on Friday to agree reforms that could ward off crisis, hinting he may otherwise resign. Hariri accused his rivals of obstructing his reform measures that could unlock $11 billion in Western donor pledges and help avert economic collapse. The reform decisions require a 50% reduction in salaries of current and former presidents, ministers and MPs plus cuts in benefits to state institutions and officials. It also obliges the central bank and private banks to contribute $3.3 billion to  achieve a “near zero deficit” for the 2020 budget. It also includes a plan to privatize the telecommunications sector and an overhaul of the costly and crumbling electricity sector, which poses one of the biggest strains on the country's depleted finances. Government sources said Hariri's cabinet would meet at midday on Monday at the presidential palace to approve the reform package. The anti-government protests, fueled by crippling economic conditions and anger at perceived government corruption, have fanned out across the country since Thursday. Cheerful, buoyant and hopeful their protests would bring change, people of all ages and religions played patriotic songs and danced in the streets, with some forming human chains and chanting for their leaders to be ousted. Festival-like scenes dominated the country from the capital Beirut to remote towns, with loudspeakers blaring music as crowds kept pouring into the streets. “I am here because I am disgusted by our politicians. Nothing works. This is not a state. Salaries are very low, prices are very high. We don't even have work these days,” said Cherine Shawa, 32, an interior architect, in Beirut. Ending rampant corruption is a central demand of the protesters, who say the country's leaders have used their positions to enrich themselves for decades through favorable deals and kickbacks. “We're here to say to our leaders ‘leave'. We have no hope in them but we're hopeful that these protests will bring change,” Hanan Takkouche, in her 40s and among a group of women in the capital.  “They came to fill their pockets. They're all crooks and thieves,” she added.  Many blamed the ruling elite for driving their children out of Lebanon because they failed to build a country that could provide jobs. Army troops and security forces deployed across the country and blocked roads leading to the presidential palace. Banks said they would remain closed on Monday and the main labor union announced a general strike, threatening further paralysis. A chorus of voices, from union leaders to politicians, have joined popular calls for Hariri's government to resign. The Maronite Christian Lebanese Forces party has said its four ministers would withdraw from the government. But the approval of the reforms by Hariri's partners seem to have met his conditions and would most likely push him to stay the course, government sources said. If Hariri, a Sunni Muslim who is traditionally backed by the West and Sunni Gulf Arab allies, resigns it would be harder for the various parties that make up the ruling coalition to form a new cabinet. A new cabinet would also likely see Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its allies more in control, a shift that would make it nearly impossible for international donors or Gulf Arab countries at odds with Iran to offer aid or investments. Without a foreign funding boost, officials and economists predict a currency devaluation or a debt default within months. The IMF said last week that Lebanon's crisis requires tough austerity measures such as tax hikes and levies on fuel, steps the country's politicians have publicly vowed not to take. Lebanon's economy registered just 0.3 percent growth last year. The IMF said the reforms were needed to stem a ballooning deficit and public debt it forecasts to reach 155 percent of GDP by year-end. The officials said the budget would not include additional taxes or fees after a decision last week to put a levy on WhatsApp calls triggered the unrest. The reforms also called for establishing new regulatory and transparency bodies within a “short period” of time to oversee reform plans.

China plans to end illegal hazardous chemical dumping by 2025,Oct 21 2019,"SHANGHAI () - China will step up efforts to end the illegal dumping of hazardous chemical waste over the next six years, raising its monitoring and treatment capacity and blacklisting violators, the environment ministry said on Monday. China's chemical sector came under heavy scrutiny this year after a factory explosion in the province of Jiangsu killed 78 people. The blast triggered a nationwide safety crackdown as well as a plan to relocate 80% of producers of toxic chemicals away from residential areas. All regions must create a comprehensive hazardous chemical monitoring system by the end of 2025 and ensure they have sufficient treatment capacity, the ecology and environment ministry said in its notice on Monday. Hazardous waste treatment will also be one of the criteria in a new corporate environmental credit system that will lead to public blacklisting and denial of financing for firms that violate rules, it added.      Local authorities will also have to draw up plans to build integrated waste disposal facilities and set up funding mechanisms for transfers of hazardous waste. To improve waste management, local governments will also be encouraged to set up more integrated “industrial bases” in sectors such as petrochemicals and nonferrous metals.  The ministry will also encourage the use of cement kilns or blast furnaces at steel plants to dispose of hazardous chemical waste. The Yangtze river delta, including the commercial hub of Shanghai and the neighboring provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, will be forced to adopt the measures by the end of next year, the ministry said.  Regions along the length of the Yangtze, together with the economic areas of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the Pearl River delta, will have to comply with the new rules by 2022. The current safety crackdown on the chemical sector is already expected to force hundreds of smaller, private players out of the market, leading to consolidation.   The campaign should drive more efficient production practices and help modernize the huge but fragmented chemical industry, S&P Global Ratings said in a report on Monday.

"Lebanon, pushed to the brink, faces reckoning over graft",Oct 21 2019,"(Repeats item that first ran on Friday) * Allies, investors, protesters press Hariri for change * Lack of reforms, corruption has worn out patience * Unusually large protests reflect anger, distrust * French official to press on power reforms -source * Beirut scrambles for dollars; more pain expected By Jonathan Spicer, Tom Perry and Samia Nakhoul BEIRUT, Oct 18 () - Lebanon is closer to a financial crisis than at any time since at least the war-torn 1980s as allies, investors and this week nationwide protests pile pressure on the government to tackle a corrupt system and enact long-promised reforms. Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri's government on Thursday hastily reversed a plan, announced hours earlier, to tax WhatsApp voice calls in the face of the biggest public protests in years, with people burning tyres and blocking roads. The country - among the world's most indebted  and quickly running out of dollar reserves - urgently needs to convince regional allies and Western donors it is finally serious about tackling entrenched problems such as its unreliable and wasteful electricity sector. Without a foreign funding boost, Lebanon risks a currency devaluation or even defaulting on debts within months, according to interviews with nearly 20 government officials, politicians, bankers and investors. Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil said in a televised speech on Friday that he gave a paper at an economic crisis meeting in September saying Lebanon needed “an electric shock”. “I also said that what little remains of the financial balance might not last us longer than the end of the year if we do not adopt the necessary policies,” he said, without describing what he meant by financial balance. Beirut has repeatedly vowed to maintain the value of the dollar-pegged Lebanese pound and honour its debts on time. But countries that in the past reliably financed bailouts have run out of patience with its mismanagement and graft, and they are using the deepening economic and social crisis to press for change, the sources told . These include Arab Gulf states whose enthusiasm to help Lebanon has been undermined by the growing clout in Beirut of Tehran-backed Hezbollah, and what they see as a need to check Iran's growing influence across the Middle East. Western countries have also provided funds that allowed Lebanon to defy gravity for years. But for the first time they have said no new money would flow until the government takes clear steps toward reforms it has long only promised. Their hope is to see it move towards fixing a system that sectarian politicians have used to deploy state resources to their own advantage through patronage networks instead of building a functional state. A crisis could stoke further unrest in a country hosting some 1 million refugees from neighbouring Syria, where a Turkish incursion in the northeast this month has opened a new front in an eight-year war. “If the situation remains, and there are no radical reforms, a devaluation of the currency is inevitable,” said Toufic Gaspard, a former adviser to Lebanon's finance ministry and former economist at its central bank and the International Monetary Fund. “Since September a new era has begun,” he added. “The red flags are large and everywhere, especially with the central bank paying up to 13% to borrow dollars.” The first reform on Beirut's agenda is one of the most intractable: fixing chronic power outages that make private generators a costly necessity, a problem many see as the main symbol of corruption that has left services unreliable and infrastructure crumbling. Hariri, in a televised speech to the nation, said he had been struggling to reform the electricity sector ever since taking office. After “meeting after meeting, committee after committee, proposal after proposal, I got at last to the final step and someone came and said ‘it doesn't work',” he said. Presenting the difficulties of implementing reform more widely, Hariri said every committee required a minimum of nine ministers to keep everyone happy. “A national unity government? OK, we understand that. But committees of national unity? The result is that nothing works.” Underscoring the pressure from abroad, Pierre Duquesne, a French ambassador handling so-called CEDRE funding, is traveling to Lebanon next week to press the government on the use of offshore power barges, a banker familiar with the plan said. Duquesne wants the barges included in the electricity overhaul plan, the person said, requesting anonymity. Duquesne could not immediately be reached for comment. The contents of the 2020 budget will be key to helping unlock some $11 billion conditionally pledged by international donors under last year's CEDRE conference. But a cabinet meeting on the budget set for Friday was cancelled amid the protests. Hariri's government, which includes nearly all of Lebanon's main parties, had proposed a tax of 20 cents per day on calls via voice-over-internet protocol (VoIP) used by applications including WhatsApp, Facebook and FaceTime. In a country fractured along sectarian lines, the protests' unusually wide geographic reach may be a sign of deepening anger with politicians who have jointly led Lebanon into crisis. Fires were smoldering in central Beirut, where streets were scattered with glass of several smashed shop-fronts. Tear gas was fired on some demonstrators. The newspaper an-Nahar described it as “a tax intifada”, or uprising. Another daily, al-Akhbar, declared it “the WhatsApp revolution”. “With this corrupt authority, our kids have no future,” said protestor Fadi Issa, 51. “We don't just want a resignation, we want accountability. They should return all the money they stole. We want change.” As confidence has faded and dollars have grown scarce, new cracks have emerged between Lebanon's government and its private lenders, according to several of the bankers, investors and officials who spoke to . After years of funding the government with the promise of ever higher rates of return, the banks - sensing the country is approaching collapse - are pressing for it to finally deliver reforms to win over donors. Most said Lebanon would likely feel more economic and financial strain in the months ahead but avoid haircuts on deposits or a worst-case sovereign default. Yet Beirut's years of failure to deliver reforms and the new determination among its traditional donors to press for them has left even top officials, bankers and investors divided over whether a devaluation is in store for the Lebanese pound. “You need a positive shock. But unfortunately the government thinks reforms can happen without touching the structure that benefits them,” said Nassib Ghobril, head of economic research and analysis at Byblos Bank. Lebanon must promote reforms to increase capital inflows, he said. “We can't keep going to the Emirates and Saudis. We need to help ourselves in order for others to help us.” This month, Moody's put Lebanon's Caa1 credit rating under review for a downgrade and estimated the central bank, which has stepped in to cover government debt payments, had only $6 billion-$10 billion in useable dollars left to maintain stability. That compares with some $6.5 billion in debt maturing by the end of next year. The central bank says its foreign assets stood at $38.1 billion as of Oct. 15. An official told  Lebanon has only $10 billion in real reserves. “It is a very dire situation that has five months to correct itself or there will be a collapse, around February,” he said. Hariri's government may have only a few months to deliver fiscal reforms to convince France, the World Bank and other parties to the CEDRE agreement to unlock $11 billion in conditional funding. The head of regional investments for a large U.S. asset manager said Lebanese officials are privately saying a plan that addresses short- and long-term electricity shortages will be announced before year end, after which the government will raise tariffs. But critics say no concrete steps have been taken despite energy ministry statements that the plan is on track. Hariri left Paris last month with no immediate cash commitment after visiting French President Emmanuel Macron. Likewise this month he left Abu Dhabi empty-handed after meeting Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan. Lawmakers in Beirut struggled to explain what happened in Abu Dhabi after Hariri claimed the United Arab Emirates had promised investments following “positive” talks. Investors, bankers and economists say at least $10 billion is needed to renew confidence among the Lebanese diaspora whom for decades have underpinned the economy by maintaining accounts back home. But so far this year, deposits have shrunk by about 0.4%. The government has sought a smaller cushion from Sunni Muslim allies to buy some time. But to secure funding from the UAE or Saudi Arabia, Beirut would likely have to meet conditions meant to weaken Shi'ite Hezbollah's hand in Lebanon's government, said several sources. Hezbollah, which faces U.S. sanctions, is seen to be gaining more control over state resources by naming the health minister in January after last year's elections brought more of its allies into the legislature. Some say Saudi Arabia, UAE and the United States are motivated to hold out on Beirut as part of their wider policy seeking to weaken Iran and its allies which have been fighting proxy wars with Gulf Arab states on several fronts. “Their tolerance of Iran and Hezbollah has lowered significantly. The ‘Lebanese exception' is gone,” said Sami Nader, Beirut-based director of the Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs. “The balance has tilted and we are now at odds with our former friends because Hezbollah now has the upper hand politically.” The former regional head at a major Western bank put it bluntly: “People have lost patience with the corruption in which a frozen Parliament with no authority is simply divvying up the pie among politicians.” “But at the end of the day the Lebanese political class usually succeeds in convincing allies that they should not let the system collapse and bring civil war again,” he added. Lebanon, straddling the Middle East's main sectarian lines, was historically the region's foreign-exchange hub into which deposits flowed, especially since 1997 when its currency was pegged to the dollar at 1,507.5 pounds. But after a reckoning in August and September in which the cost of insuring Lebanon's sovereign debt surged  to a record high, things have changed. Depositors, including the diaspora drawn by rates much higher than in Europe or the United States, are pulling funds in the face of Lebanon's swelling twin deficits, inability to secure foreign funding, and unorthodox central bank efforts to attract dollar inflows. Among Lebanon's 6 million citizens, trust has worn thin. Depositors can no longer easily withdraw dollars, and most ATMs no longer provide them, forcing people to turn to so-called parallel FX markets where $1 is worth more than the official peg. “I am with the protesters,” said Walid al-Badawi, 43. “I have three children, I am a taxi driver, I work all day to get food for my kids and I can't get it.” Gaspard, the central bank's former research head, said foreign exchange was easy even through Lebanon's 15-year civil war. There was also always a balance of payments surplus - until 2011 when deficits began to grow, reaching $12 billion last year. Three events precipitated the crisis of confidence that for years seemed inevitable: a series of central bank efforts since 2016 to keep growing deposits with rates of more than 11% on large deposits; a public sector pay hike last year that raised the budget deficit to more than 11% of GDP; low oil prices in recent years that have weakened Gulf allies. In a report on Thursday the IMF described Lebanon's position as “very difficult,” adding “substantial new measures” are needed to protect it and reduce large deficits. As dollars have dried up, banks have effectively stopped lending and can no longer make basic foreign-exchange transactions for clients, one banker said. “The whole role of banks is to pour money into the central bank to finance the government and protect the currency,” he said. “Nothing is being done on the fiscal deficit because doing something will disrupt the systems of corruption.” The resistance from banks has been subtle but telling given their central role in financing the government. When Beirut proposed a $660 million reduction in debt service costs in its 2019 budget, banks never signed up to the idea. They have also been less enthusiastic about subscribing to Eurobonds including a planned $2-billion issuance later this month, officials said. Without reform, “banks agree we can no longer support the public sector,” said Byblos Bank's Ghobril. ","{'neg': 0.09, 'neu': 0.828, 'pos': 0.082, 'compound': 0.1965}",0.1965

Mahfud told reporters he was asked by the president if he was ready to serve, but was not told what post he could be given. “On Wednesday, we are all invited to be announced to all of you, we were called one by one today,” Mahfud told Kompas TV at the presidential palace, adding that a swearing in was scheduled at 9 A.M.

On Sunday, Widodo said he planned to introduce ministers in his cabinet for a second term on Monday morning. No official announcement has been made on the cabinet. Several other potential candidates visited the palace on Monday morning, including Nadiem Makarim, the chief executive of Indonesian ride-hailing and payments firm Gojek, who has been linked in the media as a possible post in a new digital economy ministry or in education. “I have received a big honour to be able to join the cabinet of the president,” Makarim told reporters at the presidential palace. He also said he has resigned from Gojek. Makarim said his specific role would be announced by the president later in the week. Gojek, which is valued at $10 billion, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on who would succeed Makarim. Widodo's election campaign manager Erick Thohir, who is chairman of media business Mahaka Media, was also at the palace. Shares of Mahaka Media soared 20% on Monday on expectations that Thohir, a former chairman of Italian football club Inter Milan, joining the cabinet. Widodo has previously said that respected finance minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati would retain a position in the cabinet, but gave no further details.

"China unexpectedly keeps LPR lending benchmark unchanged, but outlook for rates down",Oct 21 2019,"SHANGHAI () - China on Monday unexpectedly kept unchanged its new benchmark lending rate, suggesting Beijing is keen to avoid overly loosening monetary policy for fear it may push up already-high debt levels across the economy.  The one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR) CNYLPR1Y=CFXS remained at 4.20%, steady from the previous monthly fixing. The five-year LPR CNYLPR5Y=CFXS was fixed at 4.85%, unchanged from September. A  poll last week had forecast the rate would be cut again following reductions in August and last month. Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac in Singapore, said Monday's decision does not point to an end to the downward adjustment in the LPR. “That said, the outcome is likely to reinforce the somewhat risk-on sentiment today,” Cheung said. “Looking ahead, we still see each monthly LPR re-set as providing an opportunity for a baby-step reduction.” Investors in China's financial markets took the rate decision in stride. Benchmark 10-year treasury futures for December delivery CFTZ9, the most-traded contract, were barely moved after the data release. A separate  poll of 83 analysts showed that the central bank is expected to slash the one-year LPR to 4.00% by the end of 2019, down by 20 basis point from its current level. The decision to keep the LPR steady came just days after China reported its third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth cooling to near 30-year low. Economists and China observers say a recent bath of weak data showing a further loss of momentum in the world's second-biggest economy underlined the need for further monetary policy support. A bruising 15-month long Sino-U.S. trade dispute was also one of the key factors fueling the easing expectations. U.S. President Donald Trump has outlined the first phase of a deal to end a trade war and suspended a threatened tariff hike, though officials on both sides said much more work needed to be done. All the same, some policy insiders have said the room for the government to step up stimulus measures could be limited by its worries about rising debt risks and possible property bubbles. Data earlier on Monday showed new home prices in China grew at a steady pace in September, with fewer cities reporting price gains, giving the authorities some breathing room as they refrain from over-stimulating the property sector. Beijing has leaned more heavily on fiscal stimulus to address the current downturn, announcing trillions of yuan in tax cuts and special local government bonds to finance infrastructure projects.      Monday's fixing was the third since the People's Bank of China (PBOC) unveiled the new lending benchmark, which is set by 18 banks.  The new LPR is linked to the rate on PBOC's medium-term lending facility (MLF), which is determined by broader financial system demand for central bank liquidity. The one-year MLF rate, last cut in February 2016, now stands at 3.3%. The PBOC unexpectedly injected 200 billion yuan ($28.29 billion) through MLF loans last week while keeping the lending rates unchanged.

UPDATE 2-Australia's Afterpay attempts to stem share slide as regulatory scrutiny mounts,Oct 21 2019,"* Afterpay says not currently subject to any RBA inquiry * Stock sheds 8.1% in fourth straight day of losses * Afterpay asserts it is not a traditional credit provider * Analysts say regulatory issues likely to linger (Recasts and updates throughout with more detail, share price, analyst comment) By Rushil Dutta Oct 21 () - Australia's Afterpay Touch Group Ltd on Monday moved to stem speculation about adverse changes to the country's payments regulation that have hammered its share price for several days, saying it was not currently subject to any inquiry by the central bank. Afterpay was making its first statement since its shares began falling last week following a downbeat assessment from brokerage UBS and an announcement from the Reserve Bank of Australia that it planned to dig deeper into the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) industry next year. Afterpay's shares fell as much as 8.1% on Monday at A$27.25, its lowest level since Aug. 28. They have dropped 25.5% since last Wednesday when UBS initiated its coverage of Afterpay, valuing the company significantly under current market levels. While Afterpay said on Monday it “is not currently subject to an RBA inquiry or review process”, it will be part of the central bank's review of the payments industry in 2020. Still, Afterpay asserts that it is not a traditional credit provider as its services extend far beyond the payment processing aspects of a transaction and are limited to certain purchases. “Contrary to traditional credit models, Afterpay is a free service for customers who pay on time,” it said in a statement. “Afterpay generates the majority of its revenue from merchants who choose to provide Afterpay as a service, rather than merely a form of payment.” However, analysts said regulatory concerns would hang over the company, which is often seen as a bellwether of the BNPL sector. “I believe there will be continued regulatory issues that are not going to be resolved anytime quickly,” said Brad Smoling, managing director at Smoling Stockbroking. The BPNL sector has become a darling of stock analysts due to its scope for global expansion and online shopping growth. Also attractive is its popularity among the Millennial and Gen Z populations because it provides easier access to credit than traditional routes. A concerted push towards international growth - particularly in the United States - boosted Afterpay's stock for much of 2019, despite the company reporting a steeper loss in the year to June 30. But Afterpay has also drawn the scrutiny of regulators; most notably financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC demanding an external auditor report for suspected non-compliance with money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws earlier this year. Initiating coverage of Afterpay last week, UBS questioned the company's business model for disallowing merchants from passing on surcharges to their customers. “In our view, somewhat paradoxically, the more successful BNPL services are, the more likely they are to attract regulatory scrutiny,” UBS said, giving Afterpay's shares a target price of A$17.25 - just half the value of Afterpay's close on the previous day.

Japan's extended exports slump could push BOJ to ease next week,Oct 21 2019,"TOKYO () - Japan's exports contracted for a 10th straight month in September, adding to speculation the central bank could ease monetary policy as soon as next week to support an economy hit by a slowdown in global demand. A bitter Sino-U.S. trade war and slowing growth in China have heightened the risks of a global recession, darkening the outlook for Japan's economy, the world's third-largest. Exports in September slumped 5.2% from a year earlier, Ministry of Finance data showed on Monday, dragged down by car and airplane parts to the United States and semiconductor production equipment to South Korea. The fall was larger than a 4.0% drop expected by economists and marked the longest run of declines in exports since a 14-month stretch from October 2015 to November 2016. In volume terms, exports fell 2.3% in the year to September, the second consecutive month of declines. The extended fall in exports comes after the government lowered its assessment of the economy on Friday, raising a warning flag over weakness in exports. That, among other factors, has triggered calls from some Japanese policymakers the government is ready to take fiscal measures if extra economic support was needed. “There is a possibility that there will be another fall in exports hereafter,” said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance.  “Though overall conditions are currently stable, it would become a factor for monetary easing if it did affect Japan's economy as a whole.” Markets are rife with speculation the Bank of Japan could ease at its Oct. 30-31 meeting, after it said at its rate review last month it would take a more thorough look at whether rising overseas risks could derail Japan's fragile economic recovery. The BOJ will “certainly” reduce short- to medium-term interest rates if it needed to ease monetary policy, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told  on Saturday. By region, exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, slipped 6.7% year-on-year in September, down for the seventh month as shipments of auto parts declined, offsetting a rise in those of electronic chips for semiconductors. Exports to Asia - which account for more than half of Japan's overall exports - dropped 7.8% in the year to September, falling for the 11th month, hurt by a 18.7% slide in semiconductor manufacturing parts, especially those to South Korea, which has been in a trade dispute with Japan. Japan's exports to the United States fell 7.9% in the year to September, weighed down by reduced shipments of cars over 3000cc and aircraft motors and parts. Imports from the United States slipped 11.6% in September, causing Japan's trade surplus with the world's top economy to narrow by 3.5% from a year earlier to 564.1 billion yen ($5.2 billion), the trade data showed. Washington and Tokyo signed a limited trade deal last month that cuts tariffs on U.S. farm goods, Japanese machine tools and other products while further reducing the threat of higher U.S. car duties. Japan's overall imports dropped 1.5% year-on-year, a smaller decline than the median estimate for a 2.8% decrease. In volume terms, imports gained 6.8% which analysts said was largely because of front-load demand before a nationwide sales tax hike to 10% from 8% which kicked in at the start of this month. “Going forward, imports are going to decline as consumption will be hurt” by the tax hike, said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. “The trade deficit is likely going to be reduced over the coming months.” The trade balance came to a deficit of 123.0 billion yen, versus a 54.0 billion yen surplus seen by economists.

"UPDATE 1-South Korea exports dive as China woes dent sales, darken outlook",Oct 21 2019,"(Updates throughout with economist, markets) By Choonsik Yoo SEOUL, Oct 21 () - South Korean exports plunged 19.5% over the first 20 days of October from a year earlier, pressured by weak sales to China and frail global demand for semiconductors, dealing a fresh blow to a tottering economy. Economists said that Monday's figures, which were worse than an 11.7% drop in exports for the whole of September, underlined the tough road ahead for manufacturers with the chips sector holding the key for the industry's outlook. “You have to look at the semiconductor industry to talk about a rebound in exports because chips account for the largest share of South Korea's exports,” said Oh Suk-tae, economist at Societe Generale in Seoul. “It appears the semiconductor industry's cycle has reached its trough, but it's uncertain when the big turnaround will happen, as well as how fast the recovery will be.” The customs agency of South Korea, one of the world's top 10 exporters, releases 20-day foreign trade figures every month and the data is watched closely by economists to take the pulse of the global economy. Semiconductor exports, which account for around one-fifth of South Korea's total overseas shipments, dived 28.8% in value for the Oct. 1-20 period on-year as prices around the world pulled back sharply since late last year after strong rally. Markets showed a muted reaction as investors have factored in the bad numbers. The won was up about half a percent against the dollar and the stock market's KOSPI edged up 0.1%. Economists said prospects for global trade were clouded given scepticism over whether the United States and China could reach a durable deal to end a 15-month long tariff dispute that has upended global supply chains and slowed world growth. The poor export figures came less than a week after the country's central bank slashed the policy interest rate to a joint record-low on Wednesday last week, a second cut in three months, to support the faltering economy. Over the weekend, Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki told reporters while visiting Washington he was now expecting this year's economic growth to be around 2.0-2.1%, abandoning the government's target of 2.4-2.5%. Even if the semiconductor industry turns around, the slowing Chinese economy means any rebound in South Korean exports could be far from certain as the giant neighbour takes in about a quarter of Seoul's total shipments abroad.

UPDATE 1-IMF says it will remain 'strong partner' of Mexico,Oct 21 2019,"(Adds comments from Mexico's Finance Minister, background) MEXICO CITY, Oct 20 () - The International Monetary Fund will remain a “strong partner” of Mexico, the organization's managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said on Sunday following a meeting with the heads of the Mexican Finance Ministry and central bank. “The Fund will continue to be a strong partner as Mexico seeks to deliver economic stability and prosperity for all Mexicans,” Georgieva said on Twitter. Georgieva met with Mexican Finance Minister Arturo Herrera and Bank of Mexico Governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon. Herrera said he discussed renewing a flexible credit line with the IMF, calling the meeting “very successful.” “We don't anticipate using the credit line, but it's there for contingencies ... we're going to maintain the line because there is still an uncertain international context,” Herrera said at a press conference in Washington on Saturday. He had previously said the flexible credit line will be slightly reduced. The IMF recommended earlier this month that Mexico reconsider its position of limiting private companies' cooperation with state-owned oil company Pemex, whose debt is weighing heavily on the government's finances. While in Washington, Herrera met with the three main credit rating agencies, the Finance Ministry said in a statement. At those meetings Herrera discussed “the 2020 fiscal budget and measures to improve competitiveness and boost economic growth,” the ministry said.

"Somalia aims to reduce poverty, pump up infrastructure after debt erased",Oct 21 2019,"WASHINGTON () - Somalia will press ahead with poverty reduction efforts and a major regional ports and corridors initiative if international creditors forgive the country's $5 billion debt this February, as expected, the country's finance minister said on Sunday. Finance Minister Abdirahman Duale Beileh said he was heartened by progress made during discussions with officials from the United States, Somalia's biggest creditor, Britain, and others during the IMF/World Bank annual meetings this past week. “Things are looking up ... Everybody was positive,” Beileh told  in an interview. He said U.S. and other officials were pleased with Somalia's strong performance in hitting key benchmarks in a program to work toward debt forgiveness. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on Saturday pledged the IMF's full support for Somalia's push for debt relief in the “near future.” The African nation has about $4.7 billion in external debt, which the IMF has declared to be unsustainable. The Fund is analyzing the exact grants needed from members to address Somalia's debt arrears ahead of a board meeting in mid-November, Beileh said. Britain, the European Union and Qatar had offered to cover about $150 million of the roughly $330 million that Somalia owes the IMF, he said. The U.S. Treasury, which is owed $1 billion by Somalia, had played a role in encouraging support from other IMF members, and was in talks with Congress about steps needed to erase the big bilateral debt pile. “They were very skeptical when our government started, but now they are saying Somalia has traveled enough,” he said. Once it obtains debt relief, Somalia is negotiating to receive grants worth about $300 million per year for the next three years, Beileh said. That will allow it to start spending on projects to reduce poverty by improving education and healthcare, shoring up water and electricity supply and investing in other critical infrastructure projects, he said. After 30 years with little international support, Somalia has needs “on every corner,” he said. “The country is in bad shape, and that is an understatement. You name it, we need it.” Beileh said Somalia was also working with neighbors Kenya, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Djibouti on a five-year, $15 billion project to establish ports and transportation corridors. Backed by the EU, the African Development Bank and the World Bank, the project will help boost trade in the region, he said. “Somalia is very committed to doing its part. I think we really have turned the corner. And when people are committed, they will do miracles,” he said. ","{'neg': 0.067, 'neu': 0.815, 'pos': 0.118, 'compound': 0.9564}",0.9564
Facebook open to currency-pegged stablecoins for Libra project,Oct 21 2019,"WASHINGTON () - Facebook Inc (), facing growing skepticism about its digital currency project Libra, on Sunday said the initiative could use cryptocurrencies based on national currencies such as the dollar, instead of the synthetic one it initially proposed. David Marcus, who heads the Libra project for Facebook, told a banking seminar the group's main goal remained to create a more efficient payments system, but it was open to looking at alternative approaches for the currency token it would use. “We could do it differently,” he said. “Instead of having a synthetic unit ... we could have a series of stablecoins, a dollar stablecoin, a euro stablecoin, a sterling pound stable coin, etc,” Marcus told the panel.  “We could definitely approach this with having a multitude of stablecoins that represent national currencies in a tokenized digital form,” he said. “That is one of the options that should be considered.” Marcus said he was not suggesting currency-pegged stablecoins were the group's new preferred option. “What we care about is the mission and there are a number ways to go about this,” Marcus told  after the panel, adding that the Libra needed to “demonstrate a lot of agility.” The Facebook-led project suffered severe setbacks earlier this month, as major payment companies Mastercard Inc () and Visa Inc () became the latest partners to quit the group behind the project. Other key members that have pulled out included Stripe, eBay Inc () and Booking Holdings Inc () and PayPal Holdings Inc (). Global policymakers and regulators have also worry that creation of a new synthetic global currency could upend the global financial system, threaten users' privacy, and facilitate money laundering. Group of 20 finance leaders on Friday agreed to set strict regulations on cryptocurrencies and said such stablecoins should not be issued until various global risks were addressed. Marcus told  that Facebook was still aiming for a June 2020 launch of Libra, but acknowledged it could miss that target due to regulatory hurdles. “We'll see. That's still the goal,” Marcus told  when asked if the recent departure of several major partners from the project would delay the planned 2020 launch. “We've always said that we wouldn't go forward unless we have addressed all legitimate concerns and get proper regulatory approval. So it's not entirely up to us,” he said. ","{'neg': 0.059, 'neu': 0.875, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': 0.1397}",0.1397

South Sudan's Machar says unlikely to be part of unity government by Nov. 12,Oct 21 2019,"JUBA () - South Sudan's main opposition leader told a visiting United Nations Security Council delegation on Sunday that he will not be part of a unity government next month, dashing the prospects  of progress in a stalled peace process. Former rebel leader Riek Machar said the parties have failed to agree on ways to integrate the army, a key condition of a peace accord signed last year, and could not see how they could form a government without it. “We in the SPLM-IO won't be there because we don't want to put the country into crisis,” he said. “The aspect needed for the establishment of such a government is not there.” President Salva Kiir and Machar signed a peace deal in September 2018 after a string of failed agreements to end a civil conflict that has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, displaced a third of the population and ruined the country's economy. The U.N. Security Council delegation said that the problems identified by Machar can be solved by the Nov. 12 deadline.  “What Dr. Riek Machar is asking is not impossible to do in the next three weeks but need the political leaders to say (we are) going to do it,” Jerry Matthews Matjila, South Africa's Ambassador to the U.N., told reporters.  Kelly Craft, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., said that they are still holding to the Nov. 12 deadline.  “We expect both the government and the oppositions to unify together and to be able to put their people first,” she said.  In May, the two sides agreed to form a unity government in six months and in September said that they will establish a transitional government by Nov.12 as part of the deal.  The pact has stalled because the government has said it does not have the finances to fund the disarmament and integration of the army. Machar said he met with Kiir on Sunday to discuss the security arrangements and they could not come to an agreement on the issue.  “The security arrangement has to be in place,” he said.  The parties have also been unable to conclude negotiations on regional states, another crucial component of the pact. South Sudan's cabinet affairs minister Martin Elia said the head of the army Gabriel Jok Riak has assured them that 3000 members of a protection force will be ready before Nov. 12, 900 of whom will be from Machar's group.   “Machar should not complain about the delay in implementing some of the key mechanisms because he has representatives in all the committees,” he said.  South Sudan aims to hold elections after a transition period of three years. The country secured independence from north Sudan in 2011 after decades of war but descended into its own conflict at the end of 2013 after Kiir sacked Machar as vice president. The United States has said that it will not accept more delays to the formation of a transitional government and will re-evaluate its relationship with South Sudan and may impose sanctions on leaders if a government is not formed by Nov. 12.   The Security Council urged the parties to set aside their disagreements for the sake of peace.  “Now it is time to make a compromise necessary for the formation of the transitional government of national unity,” Craft said.

UPDATE 1-Lebanon protesters keep pressure on government as reform deadline nears,Oct 20 2019,"* Lebanon protests enter fourth day * Growing calls for government to resign * PM Hariri proposes reform plan to government partners (Adds comments, IMF report, colour) By Eric Knecht and Suleiman Al-Khalidi BEIRUT, Oct 20 () - Protesters in Lebanon flooded the streets on Sunday, keeping pressure on Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri as a self-imposed deadline to deliver a package of badly needed reforms for the country's crumbling economy drew near. Anti-government protests that have swept the country since Thursday have pulled together all segments of Lebanese society in an unusually unified call for the downfall of a political elite that protesters blame for plunging the economy into crisis. On Sunday demonstrators clogged streets across the country for a fourth day with marches resembling outdoor festivals. Loudspeakers blared nationalistic music as energised protesters chanted calls for the government's fall. “I didn't expect people from the country's north, south and Beirut to join hands and like each other. The protests have brought together everyone and this has never happened before,” said Sahar Younis, a 32-year-old worker with a non-governmental organisation. Hariri, who is leading a coalition government mired by sectarian and political rivalries, gave his feuding partners a 72-hour deadline on Friday to agree to reforms that could ward off economic crisis, hinting he may otherwise resign. He accused his rivals of obstructing budget measures that could unlock $11 billion in Western donor pledges and help avert economic collapse. Government sources said Hariri was waiting for his coalition to get on board with the economic proposals, which include taxes on banks and implementing a plan within one month to overhaul the country's costly and crumbling state electricity utility. Reforming the country's wasteful electricity sector is key for potential investors and donors who consider it one of the biggest strains on the country's depleted finances. Pressure on Hariri has mounted as a rising chorus of voices, from union leaders to politicians, join popular calls for his government to resign. The Maronite Christian Lebanese Forces party said late Saturday its four ministers would withdraw from the government. If Hariri, a Sunni Muslim who is traditionally backed by the West and Sunni Gulf Arab allies, resigns it would be harder for the various parties that make up the ruling coalition to form a new cabinet. A new cabinet would also likely see Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its allies more in control, a shift that would  make it nearly impossible for international donors or Gulf Arab countries at odds with Iran to offer aid or investments. Ending rampant corruption is a central demand of the protestors, who say the country's leaders have used their positions to enrich themselves for decades through favourable deals and kickbacks. “All of the leaders should be put under house arrest and be held accountable to return the money they stole from the state so Lebanon can get back on its feet,” said Antoine Zahli, 43, a pharmacist who was among the protesters in downtown Beirut. Charbel Antoun, a 17-year-old student added: “We want to stay in Lebanon to build our future but if these corrupt politicians stay here what future will be left for us?” Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has thrown his powerful Shi'ite group's weight behind the current government, saying the country's deep economic crisis means precious time should not be wasted forming a new one. Nasrallah said on Saturday that imposing more taxes on people could lead to an “explosion” of unrest and warned of the risk of bankruptcy and currency devaluation if the government failed to come up with solutions. Without a foreign funding boost, Lebanon faces bleak economic prospects. Officials and economists also predict a currency devaluation or a debt default within months if it fails to sure up its finances. The IMF said last week that Lebanon's crisis requires tough austerity measures such as tax hikes and levies on fuel, steps the country's politicians have publicly vowed not to take. The mounting unrest was triggered in part by a proposed fee on WhatsApp calls, a measure quickly scrapped but that was seen by many as the latest government attempt to squeeze citizens receiving little in return from the state. Lebanon's economy registered just 0.3 percent growth last year. The IMF said the reforms were needed to stem a ballooning deficit and public debt it forecasts to reach 155 percent of GDP by year-end, one of the world's highest.

Indonesia's Widodo faces test on reform credentials in second term,Oct 20 2019,"JAKARTA () - Indonesian President Joko Widodo was sworn in on Sunday for a second five-year term leading the world's third-biggest democracy, after an election dominated by economic issues but also the growing influence of conservative Islam. Widodo, 58, has pledged to cut red tape and keep building infrastructure to underpin growth in southeast Asia's largest economy, but also made improving education a top priority to encourage investment and create jobs for a youthful population of 260 million people. “This will be a big problem if we fail to create enough job opportunities,”  Widodo told parliament after his inauguration, where he cited his dream of Indonesia becoming one of the world's top five economies by 2045 with a GDP worth $7 trillion.   The president said he would push two bills to replace laws that have hampered job creation, as well as warning he could sack underperforming civil servants. He said he would name his cabinet on Monday morning. There was tight security at parliament for his swearing-in alongside his vice president, Islamic cleric Ma'ruf Amin.  More than 30,000 security personnel were deployed following recent student demonstrations and after the country's security minister was stabbed by a suspected Islamist militant earlier this month.  The inauguration was attended by regional leaders including Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Malaysia's Mahathir Mohamad and Singapore's Lee Hsien Loong.  Widodo grew up in a riverside slum and was the first national leader to come from outside the political and military elite. Popularly known as Jokowi, his everyman image has resonated with ordinary voters, though he has been criticized for being too beholden to powerful party backers and surrounding himself with former generals from the era of late strongman leader Suharto.  “The president wants to improve the investment environment but is likely to face implementation woes when planned reforms are confronted by the interests of power brokers in his coalition,” Achmad Sukarsono, a political analyst at Control Risks, said in a note. Last month, Indonesia saw the biggest student demonstrations since Suharto stepped down in 1998 amid anger over bills parliament had tried to push through that critics say threaten democracy, intrude into privacy and hurt the fight against graft.   Still, so far Widodo's popularity appears to be holding up. A survey published last week by Indonesia's biggest newspaper Kompas showed his approval rating dipping only slightly to 58.8%.  In April's election, Widodo defeated former general Prabowo Subianto by a double-digit margin, but the poll revealed a split with more moderate Muslims and minorities backing Widodo and conservative Muslim regions backing his rival.  Violent rioting broke out in Jakarta when Prabowo contested the poll results over claims of cheating, but the Constitutional Court upheld Widodo's victory and there have since been talks to bring some opposition figures into the government. The make-up of Widodo's cabinet is being closely watched to see the proportion of technocrats versus party affiliated posts and there has been speculation that Prabowo or other members of the opposition could join the cabinet. There are expected to be 34 ministers in the cabinet and Widodo said around 16 would come from political parties.  The president's $33 billion plan to relocate Indonesia's capital from sinking, congested Jakarta on Java island to the island of Borneo has grabbed headlines. But it has also raised questions about how it would be financed and its environmental impact. Indonesia's economic growth is forecast to slow for the first time in four years in 2019 and some independent observers warn of a further slowdown amid a global downturn.

French SMEs that do business with UK poorly prepared for Brexit,Oct 20 2019,"PARIS () - More than half of French small and mid-sized companies that do business with Britain have not assessed the impact of Brexit, according to a French finance ministry survey, weekly newspaper Journal du Dimanche (JDD) reported. France has warned companies bringing goods in and out of Britain through its border after Brexit that they are responsible for making sure their paperwork is in order, French junior economy minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher told  earlier. JDD cited results of an October poll of 3,000 SMEs that showed 54% of the companies declared not knowing how Britain's exit from the European Union would impact their business, while 40% have studied potential consequences and only 6% have exact calculations. The survey also showed that 53% of the companies surveyed said they were poorly prepared for Brexit. “I cannot be satisfied with that 54 percent of the companies declared not having examined the consequences of Brexit for themselves, their clients and their suppliers,” Pannier-Runacher told JDD. Pannier has said the government had done all it could to prepare. Now it was up to the companies to act. ","{'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.942, 'pos': 0.035, 'compound': 0.2658}",0.2658
Factbox: Key challenges for Indonesia's Widodo in second term,Oct 20 2019,"JAKARTA () - Indonesian President Joko Widodo started his second five-year term on Sunday pledging faster infrastructure development and more investment opportunities to create jobs and growth in Southeast Asia's biggest economy.  However, he faces fresh challenges after some of the biggest  student demonstrations in decades erupted last month opposing new bills parliament had tried to push through that critics say undermine democracy and threaten basic freedoms.   Here some key policy issues facing the president: Hampered by soft commodity prices, Indonesia has struggled to lift economic growth above 5% in recent years despite a boom in infrastructure building and attempts to cut red tape hampering investment.  Indonesia has attracted investment in mineral smelting, but has failed to win as much of the manufacturing investment moving out of China compared with some rivals. Widodo has pledged to improve the investment climate further by relaxing strict labor rules, opening up more areas to foreign investors and speeding up trade agreements. But the stakes are high given 2019 economic growth is expected to slow for the first time in four years amid risks of global recession. Student protests may persist amid anger over a law that they say weakens the war on graft and other controversial new bills, including a criminal code that outlaws sex outside marriage. Ahead of his inauguration, Widodo approved parliament's bill to put the Corruption Eradication Commission under the watch of a new committee and curb its freedom to wiretap suspects.Last week, over 40 economists signed an open letter urging Widodo to revoke the law, arguing corruption hurts efficiency and hampers investment. In a country where about half the population is under 30, students consistently rank near the bottom of international student surveys.  The president has allocated money for skills training for the unemployed and expanded a program to pay for higher education for the poor. Government officials also say a ban on foreign ownership in the university sector will be lifted, but primary education, particularly in remote areas, remains under-resourced. Indonesia's two easternmost provinces are among the country's poorest regions and have seen a spike in violence since August, triggered by racial slurs made against Papuan students on the main island of Java. Demands by some separatist groups for a new independence referendum have gained momentum during the unrest.  Some Papuans see a 1969 vote to integrate the former Dutch colony with Indonesia, which was backed by the United Nations, as illegitimate. Widodo has said he is open to holding talks with separatist leaders to end the unrest, a departure from the stance of previous governments and some of his ministers. Indonesia has the world's biggest Muslim population and is often seen as an example of how democracy and Islam can co-exist, but rising conservatism has fanned greater intolerance in a country with significant religious and ethnic minorities. At the same time, Indonesia is grappling with a resurgence in Islamist militancy after a series of suicide bombings in the city of Surabaya last year and the recent stabbing of the country's chief security minister by a suspected militant. Indonesia recently suffered its worst forest fires since 2015 and as the world's biggest palm oil producer has been fighting a plan by the European Union to phase out using the oil as a transport fuel due to links to deforestation. Widodo announced plans in August to move the capital from the crowded, flood-prone city of Jakarta on Java island to the forested island of Borneo, triggering questions over how the plan would be financed and its environmental impact.

Trump abandons plan to host 2020 G7 meeting at his Florida golf resort,Oct 20 2019,"WASHINGTON () - U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned plans late on Saturday to host next year's Group of Seven summit at his Florida golf resort, after Democrats and others had decried the selection as evidence of the president misusing his office for personal gain. In a series of tweets, Trump said he would drop the plan announced Thursday by White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to host the meeting at Trump National Doral golf resort near Miami from June 10 to 12. Trump cited what he termed “Crazed and Irrational Hostility” from Democrats and the news media in explaining the reversal. “We will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately,” he wrote. The Republican president faces criticism and a number of congressional investigations over his finances and potential conflicts of interest stemming from his real estate business, which he still owns, and an impeachment inquiry into accusations that he pursued political interests in his dealings with Ukraine. On Saturday, Trump sought in his unusual reversal to emphasize what he said were the resort's positive features for hosting a large gathering. “I thought I was doing something very good for our Country,” he wrote on Twitter. The U.S. constitution's emoluments clause prohibits government officials from receiving salaries, fees or profits from foreign and domestic governments without congressional approval. Watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said on Saturday the initial decision to award the event to a Trump property was “stunningly corrupt” but the “reversal shows that pressure works”. “The president deserves no plaudits for doing the right thing only after public outcry forced him not to do the wrong thing,” it said. Democrats have said they would investigate Trump's plan to host the G7 at his property after he floated the idea in August. The decision also sparked criticism from a number of Republicans. In a statement on Thursday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler called the announcement “among the most brazen examples yet of the president's corruption.” Nadler said the committee would continue investigating “regarding these matters.” The announcement prompted requests from Democrats for detailed records from the White House to explain why other 11 other sites were not chosen and how much taxpayers would pay. In May, the Washington Post reported Doral's operating income had fallen 69 percent since 2015, citing company documents that it reviewed. Mulvaney had suggested on Thursday that Trump would not profit from use of the property because any charges would be “at cost.” He also said using Doral “was millions of dollars cheaper” than other facilities and would lead to a “roughly 50% savings” - but the White House did not release any documents to explain that analysis. Then President Barack Obama held the 2012 G8 summit at Camp David, which is in Maryland, about 60 miles (100 km) northwest of Washington. Trump first floated the idea in August after attending the G7 in France. He has also hosted world leaders at some of his other properties, including at his Mar-a-Lago oceanfront club in Palm Beach, Florida.

What happens next after UK PM Johnson writes Brexit delay letter?,Oct 20 2019,"LONDON () - Prime Minister Boris Johnson has sent an unsigned letter to the European Union requesting a delay to Britain's exit from the bloc, as well as a second note saying he did not want a “deeply corrosive” Brexit extension. Johnson was required by law to send the first letter, after parliament voted on Saturday to withhold its approval of his Brexit deal until it has passed legislation to formally ratify the agreement. Following is a rough guide to what could happen next: Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the lower house of parliament, or House of Commons, said on Saturday the government planned to put Johnson's exit deal to a debate and vote on Monday. But the speaker of the House, John Bercow, said he would rule whether that would be allowed after several lawmakers said it would break with parliamentary convention that the same question cannot be put twice during the same session. “I have been blindsided on this matter, as others have been,” Bercow told parliament after Rees-Mogg's announcement.  “I will reflect on the matter, absorbing what colleagues say and consulting others for their advice, and I will report to the House on Monday,” he added. “The government are not the arbiter of what is orderly.” Scotland's highest court, the Court of Session, is due to consider on Monday a legal challenge that sought to force Johnson to comply with the so-called Benn Act. That was the law which required him to write the extension letter if parliament had not approved either a deal or a no-deal exit by Oct. 19. Anti-Brexit campaigners had asked the court earlier this month for it either to issue an order forcing Johnson to ask for a delay or for it to instruct that a letter be sent to the EU on his behalf if he refused.  The campaigners also said he should face penalties including a fine or even prison if he did not comply with the Benn Act. The court, has not yet ruled on the matter and was waiting to do so pending developments up to Oct. 19. But it said this month that government lawyers had given formal legal statements - averments - that he would abide by the Benn Act and it would be a serious matter if he did not. “It would be destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the crown for the prime minister or the government to renege on what they have assured the court that the prime minister intends to do,” judge Paul Cullen, known as Lord Pentland, said. Opposition lawmakers said that by writing two letters, Johnson had broken his government's pledge to the court not to frustrate the legislation. “He may well be in contempt of parliament or the courts themselves because he's clearly trying to undermine the first letter,” Labour's finance spokesman John McDonnell told Sky News. Labour's Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer told BBC television Johnson was “being childlike”, adding “I am sure there will be court proceedings”.   Johnson told parliament that “next week the government will introduce the legislation needed for us to leave the EU with our new deal on October 31”. It is widely expected to have its first main stage of debate on Tuesday. Senior minister Michael Gove said on Sunday the government would seek to get the legislation required through parliament in order to get Brexit done and leave the EU on Oct. 31. Gove and foreign minister Dominic Raab said they believed the government had the numbers to pass a deal. Former minister Amber Rudd, who quit the government over Johnson's willingness to pursue a no-deal Brexit, said she and most of the 21 Conservative lawmakers who were kicked out of the parliamentary party for backing attempts to block a no-deal exit, would support the legislation. “He has a fragile but sincere coalition of people who want to support it,” she told Sky News. Lawmakers will have the opportunity to bring changes to the legislation and Labour's Starmer and McDonnell said on Sunday the party would put forward amendments including on issues such as protecting worker's rights and closing the “trap door” to a no-deal Brexit at the end of a transition period in December 2020. Changes proposed by lawmakers are also likely to include the need for a confirmatory referendum on the agreement. That would throw open the possibility of Brexit not even happening -  although it is not clear whether there would be sufficient numbers among lawmakers to back such a plan.     The chairman of European Union leaders, Donald Tusk, said on Saturday he had received the extension request and he would now be consulting with EU capitals on how to react. After a short meeting on Sunday, diplomats with the bloc said the EU would play for time rather than rush to decide on the delay request. “We're looking for more clarity towards the end of the week, hoping that by that time we will also see how things develop in London,” one senior EU diplomat said. Leaders of the 27 states that will make up the EU once Britain leaves are unlikely to deny the extension request. Gove said the EU was “waiting to see what parliament does now”.  “We'll have an opportunity in the days ahead to consider the legislation that allows us to leave the European Union. If people vote for that legislation (..) then we can leave and we can leave in time,” he said. Both the governing Conservatives and main opposition Labour Party say they want a new election, but Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he will not back any move to hold one until a no-deal Brexit is ruled out. “An election is inevitable because of the numbers in parliament, because we have got to break the impasse, the timing will be a matter for Jeremy Corbyn ... but it is inevitable that sooner or later this breaks into a general election,” said Starmer.

ECB's Vasle urges fiscal policy action to boost economy,Oct 20 2019,"LJUBLJANA () - The current challenging global economic conditions demand broad macroeconomic policy actions in the euro zone and not just monetary policy actions, ECB Governing Council member Bostjan Vasle said on Sunday. Vasle, who is also the governor of the Bank of Slovenia, issued a statement after he attended the annual International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank meeting.  He said the IMF believed there were significant risks for a faster slowdown of global economic growth than expected so far. These include trade conflicts, uncertainties regarding Brexit and slower economic growth in China. He said present economic conditions indicate there will be a longer period of low interest rates, high liquidity and lax conditions of financing. “The behavior of participants of financial markets in a longer period of such conditions can reduce financial stability of some countries and with that the whole of the euro zone,” the statement said. Vasle's statement said too high valuations in financial markets could lead to “sudden worsening of financing conditions and worse macroeconomic situation particularly in financially vulnerable countries.” He pointed out the IMF highlighted that pension groups and insurers were more vulnerable due to low yields amid low interest rates. He said banks were also spreading their activities into  more risky areas which is why the Bank of Slovenia recently imposed restriction on banks' loans to consumers. Vasle said that the IMF was urging the euro zone countries with fiscal capacity to ease fiscal policy and stimulate economic growth with the help of public investments while countries with limited fiscal capacity should introduce gradual fiscal consolidation and reforms that would improve growth potential, including labor market reforms. “Similar to the ECB, the IMF also stressed that to increase low inflation in the euro zone there was a need for other policy actions, not just the monetary policy,” the statement said.

Bahrain making good progress on fiscal balance plan -finance minister,Oct 20 2019,"WASHINGTON, Oct 19 () - Bahrain is making good progress on its fiscal consolidation plan and is on track to eliminate its deficit by 2022 as planned, Finance Minister Sheikh Salman bin Khalifa Al Khalifa said on Saturday. Bahrain, which does not have the vast oil wealth of fellow Gulf states, was hit hard by the 2014 slump in crude prices. The kingdom released a plan last year to overhaul its economy and fix its debt-burdened finances, aided by a $10 billion aid package from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. “We've had very good execution so far,” al Klalifa told , when asked if Bahrain would meet its target. “We've been very disciplined with regards to executing the fiscal balance plan and ensuring that we're executing with regards to the targets.” Al Khalifa said Bahrain had reduced its deficit by 37.8% in the first six months of 2019, while increasing non-oil revenue by 47%. It also cut administrative costs by 14% and had 18% of civil servants accept voluntary retirement packages, he said. It was critical to ensure job creation, and spending on health, education and other social services spending remained strong as Bahrain continued its consolidation program, he said. Bahrain's Sunni Muslim rulers are concerned that austerity measures could anger the majority Shi'ite-led opposition and stir more of the unrest that has rattled the kingdom since the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011. “As we continue to execute the fiscal balance plan, we will want to ensure that we continue to see positive economic growth and job creation,” he said. Al Khalifa said a September bond issue, the country's first since the fiscal balance plan was launched, sparked good demand and with much tighter pricing than its previous bond issue. He gave no details on borrowing plans for the coming year, but said half of borrowing needs would be met by the aid package from Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait, and half from the market. As well as introducing a value-added tax in January, the government has cut subsidies, raised fees and is pushing economic diversification and inward investment. Al Khalifa said job creation had been a heavy focus during the International Monetary Fund and World Bank fall meetings in Washington this week. “Maintaining economic growth is important but job creation is important regardless of where you are in the business cycle,” he said. In addition, he said the government had launched a mobile phone application, Tawasul, that allowed citizens to file complaints about the government. Thousands of complaints on issues ranging from road work to the opening hours of government offices had been received since 2014, and 100% had been addressed, he said.

Fallout from Trump's trade wars felt by economies around the world,Oct 20 2019,"WASHINGTON, Oct 19 () - The collateral damage of the United States' trade wars is being felt from the fjords of Iceland to the auto factories of Japan. Central bank governors and finance ministers traded grim tales of suffering economies at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank fall meetings in Washington this week. Some also noted how far U.S. policy had shifted from the 1940s, when Washington co-founded the IMF. At that time, “the world economy had been hammered for over a decade by high tariff barriers, depression and war,” prompting then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau to champion a global economic system, World Bank President David Malpass told attendees at a session this week. The U.S. message then, Malpass said, was: “First, there's no limit to prosperity. Second, broadly shared prosperity benefits everyone.” As the IMF's gathering of 189 member-nations drew to a close, the unintended negative impacts of the trade wars were becoming clear, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said. “Everybody loses.” The United States, the world's largest importer, started a bitter tariff war with China, the world's largest exporter, 15 months ago. U.S. President Donald Trump is also in the midst of renegotiating, and sometimes upending, trade relationships with many of Washington's top trading partners. The fallout will slow global growth in 2019 to 3.0%, the slowest pace in a decade, the IMF estimated this week. This pain is not being shared equally. The United States remains the least exposed of the world's 20 largest economies to a drop in exports in part because of its massive domestic consumer spending base. (Here's a graphic that shows the impact of tariffs in the United States and around the world. ) The damage is being particularly felt in European countries which “rely on exports and are open to trade,” the European Union's Economic and Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said. More than 40% of Germany's GDP was derived from exports in 2018, the most of any major global economy. Uncertainty in the business community is widespread, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told reporters. German trade group BGA recently revised down its growth forecast for German exports in 2019 to just 0.5%, from 1.5%. As a result, many companies are scaling back their investment plans, something that will have repercussions for years to come. Scholz said concerns over Britain's impending departure from the EU and the bloc's trade dispute with the United States were clearly dampening global economic growth. “The most important problem remains those factors that we cannot measure – specifically the reluctance to invest,” Scholz said. The pain is being felt in countries that don't rely on exports too, such as Iceland, which became the first developed economy to seek aid from the IMF after a 2008 banking collapse. Since then, it has rebuilt its economy in what's been called a miraculous recovery. Now, that is threatened. “We have become dependent on tourism,” explained Ásgeir Jónsson, the governor of Iceland's central bank, with annual visitors growing five-fold to 2.5 million since the crisis. Foreign arrivals, however, have plummeted since the trade wars started, and are down 15.6% this summer from the year before. Iceland, with a population of about 300,000, built foreign currency reserves on the back of the increase in visitors, he said, but those are dropping too. Trade links between countries have led to a more peaceful world in recent decades, but recent experience shows “you can never take global trade for granted,” Jónsson said. On Friday, Japan's Cabinet Office, which helps coordinate government policy, downgraded its assessment of factory output in October. The softness in production was largely due to car exports to the United States turning weaker, after growing steadily until the spring, a government official said at a briefing. “The pick-up in global growth is being delayed,” Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said. “Japan's economy is seeing exports weaken significantly and that's affecting factory output.” The United States hasn't been immune from the impact of the trade wars. American farmers have been particularly hurt by Chinese tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, prompting the Trump administration to give billions in aid to the farm belt. Washington's imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs and uncertainty about passage of a new North American free trade deal - the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement - have also stalled local economic development. The trade tensions are helping to spur a push among African nations to create a more self-reliant continent. “We must take it upon ourselves to grow trade among ourselves,” said Ukur Yatani Kanacho, Kenya's acting cabinet secretary for treasury. Abdoulaye Daouda Diallo, the finance minister of Senegal, told reporters the U.S.-China trade tensions would affect African nations in the energy sector and cut funds available on financial markets. The dispute underscored the importance of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, he said. Other emerging markets are also coming under pressure. “Ukrainian exporters faced worsened conditions in global commodity markets,” which drove down steel prices, said Kateryna Rozhkova, the deputy governor of the country's central bank. Making matters worse, “the intensification of geopolitical conflicts led to rising oil and natural gas prices in the world,” she said. Bahrain's Finance Minister Sheikh Salman bin Khalifa Al Khalifa said the Gulf region was also affected by trade tensions and the resulting slowdown in investment, although geopolitical concerns – about Iran, for example – were another major factor. “Trade tensions create uncertainty and nobody is insulated from uncertainty,” he told . Peru cut its 2019 economic growth estimate to 3% in August, from 4.2%, citing trade factors. Mexico is edging closer to a recession that its officials say might be more difficult to reverse than during the last downturn more than a decade ago. “The Great Recession basically caught everybody by surprise, but economies were willing to cooperate and work together to pull it out,” Mexican Finance Minister Arturo Herrera said. “This slowdown is taking nobody by surprise, but there is very little appetite for cooperation.” ","{'neg': 0.109, 'neu': 0.791, 'pos': 0.099, 'compound': -0.9225}",-0.9225
SoftBank seeks to avoid WeWork's liabilities with new investment: sources,Oct 20 2019,"NEW YORK () - SoftBank Group Corp () is attempting to become the majority owner of WeWork without assuming the onerous lease obligations of the U.S. office-space sharing firm, according to people familiar with the matter.  SoftBank is offering a $5 billion financing lifeline that The We Company, the parent of New York-based WeWork, is assessing against a proposal by JPMorgan Chase & Co () for a debt package of similar size from banks and institutional investors.  WeWork could run out of cash as early as next month without new financing, sources have said, after the company pulled plans in September for an initial public offering (IPO). It abandoned the IPO when investors questioned its large losses, the sustainability of its business model and the way WeWork was being run by its co-founder and former CEO Adam Neumann, who now serves as board chairman. Over the weekend, a special board committee formed by The We Company to evaluate the financing proposals, ring-fenced from the influence of SoftBank and Neumann, was working around the clock with its advisers to reach an agreement, the sources said. The negotiations could spill into next week, one of the sources cautioned.  SoftBank and its $100 billion Vision Fund own about a third of WeWork through previous investments totaling $10.6 billion. SoftBank's latest offer values WeWork at less than $10 billion, according to two of the sources, a fraction of the $47 billion it assigned to it in January in a previous fundraising round. While the split in SoftBank's contribution between equity and debt is still being negotiated, its investment could make it the majority owner of WeWork. Were this to translate to formal voting control for SoftBank, it could force it to consolidate the loss-making company on its balance sheet, the sources said. This in turn could result in SoftBank assuming WeWork's liabilities, which include long-term leases for office space that it refurbishes and rents out under short-term contracts, according to the sources. WeWork had $18 billion in long-term lease obligations as of the end of June, according its most recent public financial disclosure. It also had $1.3 billion in net debt. SoftBank has been keen not to burden its balance sheet further, given its net debt of about 5 trillion yen ($46 billion) as of the end of June, more than half its 9 trillion yen market capitalization, according to the Japanese technology conglomerate's most recent quarterly earnings statement.  One way for SoftBank to avoid assuming formal control of WeWork that would lead to accounting consolidation would be to accept nonvoting stock for any equity investment. However, it is not clear how SoftBank plans to structure the deal. SoftBank also wants to renegotiate with WeWork a previous commitment for a $1.5 billion investment in the form of warrants that are due in April at the $47 billion valuation, according to the sources. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.  A WeWork spokeswoman declined to comment. Facing a cash crunch, WeWork is seeking to slow down its expansion, reducing the number of new property leases it is taking on. The We Company's board has also agreed on a cost-cutting plan that includes layoffs, two of the sources said, without disclosing further details. The cuts will occur over the coming weeks, the sources added. Job cuts in the United States could come in the first week of November, one of the sources said. There are also expected to be job losses in other parts of the world, the source added. The We Company's seven-member board tasked two directors with representing the interests of all investors in the company by sitting on the special committee considering the financing plans,  reported earlier this week. One is Bruce Dunlevie, who is a general partner at WeWork shareholder Benchmark Capital. The other is Lew Frankfort, who is the former CEO of luxury handbag maker Coach. The board committee's advisers include investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners LP and law firms Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, one of the sources said. Representatives of Perella Weinberg, Skadden and Wilson Sonsini did not immediately respond to requests for comment. JPMorgan has not agreed to underwrite the debt package, and WeWork is waiting to see how much capital the bank will be able to raise from other lenders and credit investors. The debt package is split between about $1 billion in senior secured debt, $2 billion in unsecured debt, and $1.5 billion to $2 billion in letters of credit, two of the sources said. A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment. WeWork may seek to combine SoftBank's and JPMorgan's financing packages in some form, after the latter has completed its debt financing effort, the sources said.

Thousands take to Lebanon's streets in third day of anti-government protests,Oct 19 2019,"BEIRUT () - Tens of thousands took to the streets of Lebanon on Saturday for a third day of anti-government protests, directing growing rage at a political elite they blame for entrenched cronyism and driving the country to the economic brink. In central Beirut, the mood was fiery and festive, with protesters of all ages waving flags and chanting for revolution outside upmarket retailers and banks that had their store fronts smashed in by rioters the night before. From the south to the east and north of Lebanon, protesters marched and blocked roads to keep the momentum going despite gunmen loyal to the Shi'ite Muslim Amal movement appearing with firearms to scare them away. The latest unrest was sparked by anger over the rising cost of living and new tax plans, including a fee on WhatsApp calls, which was quickly retracted after protests - the biggest in decades - broke out. In an attempt to appease demonstrators, Lebanon's finance minister announced following a meeting with Prime Minister Saad  al-Hariri that they had agreed on a final budget that did not include any additional taxes or fees. Lebanese President Michel Aoun said in a tweet there would be a “reassuring solution” to the economic crisis. The protests followed a build-up in grievances over perceived government corruption, mismanagement of funds and a failure to address high unemployment. No leader, Christian or Muslim, was spared protesters' ire, creating a rare unity in a country riven by  sectarianism. At night, patriotic songs blared from loudspeakers in Beirut and fireworks exploded over a sea of people dancing and singing, holding banners reading “unite against corrupt politicians”. “This country is moving towards total collapse. This regime has failed to lead Lebanon and it must be toppled and replaced,” said Mohammad Awada, 32, who is unemployed. Prime minister Hariri gave his government partners a 72-hour deadline on Friday to agree on reforms that could ward off economic crisis, hinting he may otherwise resign. In a televised speech addressing the protests on Saturday, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the group was against the government resigning, and the country did not have enough time for such a move given the acute financial crisis. “Everyone should take responsibility rather than being preoccupied with settling political scores while leaving the fate of the country unknown,” he said. “All of us have to shoulder the responsibility of the current situation that we arrived at,” added Nasrallah, whose Iranian-backed Shi'ite group is Lebanon's most influential. The protests that swept villages and towns across Lebanon recall the 2011 Arab revolts that toppled four presidents. The Hezbollah leader said he recognized the protests were “honest and spontaneous” but warned that his heavily-armed and powerful group, which backed the president's rise to power, would not permit his downfall. In southern Lebanon, Amal militiamen loyal to parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri attacked peaceful demonstrators who tore his posters and chanted slogans denouncing him as corrupt. They prevented TV crews from filming the protests. In the speech, Nasrallah predicted that imposing more taxes would lead to an “explosion” of unrest. “If we don't work towards a solution we're heading towards a collapse of the country, it will be bankrupt and our currency will not have any value,” he said. “The second danger is a popular explosion as a result of wrong handling of the situation.”  Protesters from across the political spectrum filled the streets. “I am taking part because over the last 30 years warlords  have been ruling us. I am about to be 30 and my parents still tell me tomorrow will be better. I am not seeing better days ahead,” said Sylvia Yaqoub, 29, a laboratory manager. “We want back the money they stole because 30 families are ruling five million people. We won't accept this any longer.” Fadi Dhaher, 21, a university student, said his generation felt they had no future. “We are protesting because we don't want to emigrate ... they are pushing us to leave our country.” Government sources said the cabinet might hold an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss a way out of the crisis. The budget could help it unlock billions of dollars pledged by international donors who have made their support conditional  on long-delayed reforms to curb waste and corruption.

IMF chief Georgieva says supports debt relief for Somalia,Oct 19 2019,"WASHINGTON () - International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Saturday that she supports Somalia's efforts to achieve debt relief through the global lender's Highly Indebted Poor Country program. In a statement issued after her meeting in Washington with Somali Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire, Georgieva said Somalia was committed to making further reforms despite challenging circumstances, which were aimed at paving the way for debt relief.  The African nation has about $4.7 billion in external debt, accounting for about 100% of its GDP, which the Fund has declared to be unsustainable. “I assured the Prime Minister of the IMF's full support for Somalia's efforts to secure debt relief, including working with the membership of the Fund to secure the financial resources necessary to clear arrears to the IMF and cover the costs of debt relief,” Georgieva said. “We exchanged views on the importance of securing debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative as soon as possible,” she said in a statement. Somali officials met to discuss debt relief with officials from the IMF, World Bank and other institutions on Thursday on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank fall meetings.  Georgieva said the prime minister reiterated Somalia's strong commitment to continuing to implement reforms, and also highlighted its completion of the 9th National Development plan. “Maintaining strong performance, together with support from international partners, will pave the way for Somalia to receive debt relief in the near future,” Georgieva said. IMF officials this week said work on Somalia's debt relief effort is progressing well but have given no specific timetable.  In addition to specific benchmarks that must be met, additional grants are needed to address the country's debt arrears, Jihad Azour, director of the IMF's Middle East and Central Asia department, told reporters on Friday. Somali Finance Minister Abdirahman Duale Beileh said during an event at the Brookings Institution think tank this week that he expected a decision on debt relief in February 2020. “We are expecting a decision point in February next year,” Beileh said. “We have challenges, but more positive than negative.” Stephen Schwartz, who served as U.S. ambassador to Somalia from July 2016 to October 2017, said ensuring debt relief was a top priority for the Somali government for the roughly three years it has been in office. “Getting debt relief would unlock concessional lending from the international lending institutions, which would give them access to a lot of money that they could put to good use rebuilding Somalia,” Schwartz said.  “It would be a huge success. It would allow the government to function at a more robust level with more resources. It would be a huge vote of confidence for them and for the Somali people.” ","{'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.756, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.9936}",0.9936

"Russia eyes euro, yuan as currency for Eurobonds in 2020 - minister",Oct 19 2019,"WASHINGTON/MOSCOW, Oct 19 () - Russia will consider issuing sovereign Eurobonds in 2020 denominated in euros or in Chinese yuans, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Friday. Moscow is looking for alternative ways to raise money abroad after the United States imposed sanctions this year that prohibit U.S. investors from buying Russian dollar-denominated sovereign debt directly from the finance ministry. Siluanov, speaking on the sidelines of annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington D.C., said the question of sanctions and how they would impact Russia's borrowing plan was raised during his talks with investors. “We don't see problems as the result of restrictions on borrowing in dollars,” Siluanov told reporters. “We will see next year. Maybe it will be possible to emit (Eurobonds) in yuans ...  (or) in euros.” Siluanov said Russia has no plans to issue Eurobonds denominated in the U.S. currency after the sanctions. When speaking about Russia's privatisation programme, Siluanov said the government should intensify the sale of its stakes in state-controlled companies, which are not crucial for the economy. “Of course, the privatisation programme should be made more ambitious. We've relaxed a little bit, because we don't need any money...,” he told reporters. ","{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.915, 'pos': 0.056, 'compound': 0.7854}",0.7854

EWEC and ACWA secure $869 mln for Abu Dhabi desalination plant,Oct 19 2019,"ABU DHABI, Oct 19 () - Emirates Water and Electricity Company (EWEC) and Saudi Arabia's ACWA Power said on Saturday they had secured financing of 3.19 billion dirhams ($869 million) for Abu Dhabi's Taweelah water desalination plant. The project would be the world's largest reverse osmosis desalination plant, the two companies said in a statement. Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates, is building the Taweelah water desalination plant independent of a power generation plant for the first time. It has traditionally built water and power plants side by side. The plant will supply 909,200 cubic meters per day (m3/day) of water, 44% more than the world's current largest reverse osmosis plant of 624,000 (m3/day), meeting the water demand of 350,000 households, the statement said. The financing was a combination of 2.71 billion dirhams in loans, with the remainder from shareholders and operating cash flow from pre-operations, it added. Local and international banks including Emirates NBD , Natixis Mizuho Bank Siemens Bank, Bank Boubyan and the Norinchukin Bank have provided the loans. Abu Dhabi Power Corporation and Mubadala Investment Company hold a 60% equity interest in the Taweelah project while ACWA Power holds the remaining 40%.

U.S. oil major Chevron says hopeful about maintaining Venezuela presence,Oct 19 2019,"() - U.S. oil major Chevron Corp () said late on Friday it is optimistic about maintaining a presence in Venezuela even amid U.S. sanctions on the country and state oil company PDVSA as part of Washington's effort to oust President Nicolas Maduro.  The company's remarks follow an earlier report by Bloomberg that said the United States is considering extending Chevron's waiver to operate in Venezuela with more limitations by granting the company a 90-day sanctions reprieve. “We are a positive presence in Venezuela, and we are hopeful that General License 8C is renewed so that we can continue operations in the country for the long-term,” Ray Fohr, a Chevron spokesman, told  in an emailed statement.  “We have dedicated investments and a large workforce who are dependent on our presence.”  “General License No 8C” is the license that authorizes transactions in Venezuela involving PDVSA and entities it owns, according to the website of the U.S. Department of Treasury.  Chevron's future in Venezuela now depends on U.S. President Donald Trump, who must decide by Oct. 25 whether to renew the waiver allowing the company to keep operating in Venezuela despite U.S. sanctions.  The Treasury Department aims to further limit Venezuela's crude production and is concerned that Chevron's joint venture projects in Venezuela are providing financing to help Maduro's socialist government pay back its debt to Russian oil company Rosneft PJSC, Bloomberg reported on Friday.

"Kuroda says BOJ could ease policy more, still has tools available",Oct 19 2019,"WASHINGTON () - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Friday the central bank could ease monetary policy further if needed to spur growth, shrugging off views that it has used up ammunition to fight the next economic downturn. A senior International Monetary Fund official also said deepening negative interest rates remained an option if the BOJ were to ease, though adding that any such move should be accompanied by fiscal and structural steps to be effective. “We think that lowering the negative interest rate remains an option. Of course, given stubbornly anchored inflation expectations, a whole package (of steps) is needed, especially structural reforms,” Odd Per Brekk, who is the IMF's mission chief of Japan, told  on Friday. The remarks came amid simmering market speculation that the BOJ could ease policy as early as this month such as by deepening negative rates - a controversial move given the strain years of ultra-low rates is inflicting on commercial bank's profits. The IMF cut its global growth forecasts this week as manufacturers felt the pinch from the U.S.-China trade war, adding pressure on the BOJ to ramp up stimulus to prevent external headwinds from derailing a fragile recovery. IMF WARNS OF OVER-RELIANCE ON C.BANKS Coming out from a two-day meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank heads, Kuroda said some countries did mention that prolonged periods of loose monetary policy have left them with less room to ramp up stimulus. But the case for Japan was different, he said, stressing the BOJ's readiness to top up monetary support if heightening global risks threaten achievement of its 2% inflation target. “It's not as if we have limited monetary policy space. If needed, we could take additional easing steps,” Kuroda told a news conference hosted by Japan as chair of this year's G20 meeting. “We will carefully analyze economic and price developments in deciding whether such measures are necessary,” he said. While warning of heightening risks to global growth, the IMF  has urged policymakers to avoid relying too heavily on already-stretched monetary policy tools in spurring growth. “There were some views expressed at the G20 meeting that in general, prolonged periods of monetary easing have diminished space for additional easing,” Kuroda said. “But it's hard to generalize that monetary policy space has diminished, because much depends on the economic and price developments of each country,” he said. Kuroda also said there were no signs yet that the BOJ's ultra-loose monetary policy was impairing Japan's banking system by discouraging financial institutions to boost lending. The BOJ said last month it will more thoroughly assess economic and price developments at the Oct. 30-31 rate review due to heightening global risks, signaling the chance of easing policy as early as this month.

G20 kicks off debate to regulate 'stablecoins' in hit to Facebook's Libra,Oct 19 2019,"WASHINGTON () - Group of 20 finance leaders on Friday agreed to set strict regulations on cryptocurrencies such as Facebook's () Libra, warning that issuance of such “stablecoins” should not be allowed until various global risks they pose have been addressed. The agreement came after a G7 working group warned that when launched on a wide scale, stablecoins - digital currencies usually backed by traditional money and other assets - could threaten the world's monetary system and financial stability. Finance chiefs of the G20 major economies agreed that while stablecoins could have potential benefits of financial innovation, they give rise to a set of “serious” public policy and regulatory risks. “Such risks, including in particular those related to money laundering, illicit finance, and consumer and investor protection, need to be evaluated and appropriately addressed before these projects can commence operation,” the G20 finance leaders said in a statement issued after their meeting. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the G20 will kick off debate on how to regulate stablecoins based on proposals it receives from standard-setting bodies like the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The FSB and the FATF are expected to report their findings on stablecoins to the G20 next year. That reduces the chance Facebook will meet its goal of rolling out Libra in 2020. “Policymakers have expressed concerns over various risks stablecoins pose. Until they are addressed, stablecoins should not be issued. That was something agreed by the G20 members,” Kuroda told a news conference hosted by Japan, which chaired this year's G20 gatherings. The G20 has also asked the International Monetary Fund to examine the economic implications, including monetary sovereignty issues, according to the group's press release. “Some emerging countries have concerns on what could happen if stablecoins backed by a huge customer base become widely used globally,” said Kuroda, who was among the global finance leaders gathered in Washington this week for the IMF and World Bank fall meetings. “But this is not just a problem for emerging economies. It could have a broader impact on monetary policy and financial system stability,” he said. The G20 agreement underscored concerns among global policymakers about stablecoins such as Libra, which suffered a defection of a quarter of its original members that had initially backed the project. German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz on Friday redoubled his criticism of Libra, saying creation of a new world currency should be prevented. “We now know that both the G7 and G20 are quite cautious about stablecoins,” a Japanese Ministry of Finance official who attended the G20 talks told reporters. “Personally, I feel that such strong concerns held by policymakers may have been among reasons why some companies decided to pull out of the Libra project,” the official said. While setting regulations on stablecoins, policymakers will also debate ways to make existing cross-border settlement and payment systems more efficient, BOJ's Kuroda said. But such efforts will be confined to private-sector settlements, he said, adding that the G20 did not discuss the idea of central banks issuing digital currencies. “The BOJ, too, has no plans for now to issue digital currencies,” Kuroda said.

IMF awaits new fuel decree to revise Ecuador lending program: official,Oct 19 2019,"WASHINGTON () - The International Monetary Fund on Friday said it is awaiting the Ecuadorian government's next move regarding fuel subsidies to continue the revision of its lending program for the South American country. On Monday, after days of violent protests and in a major win for Ecuador's indigenous peoples, President Lenin Moreno abandoned an IMF-backed measure to end decades-old fuel subsidies aimed at getting the country's finances in check. “We are waiting for the new decree that the government will publish regarding its policies associated with the price of fuels,” said Alejandro Werner, director of the IMF's Western Hemisphere department. Werner, speaking at a press conference during the IMF and World Bank fall meetings in Washington, said the Fund is waiting to make the evaluation of a final package of policies. The review will then be concluded “in case our interaction with the Ecuadorian government is positive,” he said. ","{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.918, 'pos': 0.025, 'compound': -0.6124}",-0.6124
Ecuador's Moreno announces tax reform after rolling back fuel price hike,Oct 19 2019,"QUITO () - Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno on Friday proposed a new tax on corporations and a simplification of the tax system to improve government finances after a plan to eliminate fuel subsidies was met with violent demonstrations. Indigenous protesters led almost two weeks of demonstrations after Moreno announced he would eliminate decades-old subsidies on diesel and gasoline. He walked back the measure and promised dialogue to find different ways to close the fiscal deficit. “Today a tax reform proposal was sent to the legislature ... We will not raise the Value Added Tax,” Moreno said in a televised address. “We will ask those who have more to pay more.” The proposal includes a new tax on companies with annual revenue of more than $1 million, which he said would raise about $532 million over three years. Citizens with annual income above $100,000 will not be able to deduct personal expenses from their income tax. The plan also includes a tax on plastic bags and electronic cigarettes. The measures will need congressional approval. The tax reform proposal had been part of a broad agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for about $4.2  billion in financing that had also included changes to labor regulations. Moreno said the plan would provide incentives for small and medium exporters, as well as aid for companies affected by looting and damage during the protests. The president said he will continue with the dialogue to define a new scheme for fuel subsidies, which according to official data cost about $1.4 billion per year. “The new decree must contain a fuel subsidy policy, a policy that is fair, efficient and protects the poorest and that allocates a good part of the resources for its benefit,” he added.

But for now, it's only about how to make private-sector settlement more efficient,” Kuroda told a news conference after attending the G20 finance leaders' meeting. “There weren't discussions about central banks issuing digital currencies,” he said, adding the BOJ, too, had no immediate plans to consider issuing digital currencies.

Oracle co-CEO Mark Hurd dies at 62,Oct 19 2019,"() - Oracle Corp's () 62-year-old co-chief Mark Hurd died on Friday morning, the company said, an unexpected development that raises pressure on co-CEO Safra Catz to lead the business software maker's ongoing transition to cloud computing. Last month, Hurd went on a medical leave for unspecified health reasons, while Catz and founder Larry Ellison took over his responsibilities during the absence.  The company has not given details about the cause of death. “Oracle has lost a brilliant and beloved leader who personally touched the lives of so many of us during his decade at Oracle,” Ellison wrote in an email to company employees. Hurd and Catz were named co-CEOs in 2014, after Ellison decided to step aside to focus on his role as chief technology officer. Under their tenure, Oracle has been aggressively pushing into cloud computing to make up for a late entry into the fast-growing business dominated by Microsoft Corp () and Amazon.com Inc (). Last month, the company missed revenue estimates. Wedbush Securities analyst Steve Koenig said he does not see any changes in how the company will be run after Hurd's demise. “Safra and Larry have been long-time collaborators and partners in leading Oracle, and the company has a deep bench of sales talent.” Hurd joined Oracle as co-president in September 2010, a month after he was ousted in a controversial fashion from Hewlett-Packard Co, where he had been chief executive since 2005.  Hurd resigned from HP in August 2010 after allegations of sexually harassing an employee. An internal probe later cleared him of those charges, though it found him guilty of filing inaccurate expense reports. () Long-time friend Ellison stood up for Hurd in an email to New York Times, calling Hurd's removal the “worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago”. When Hurd and Catz were named co-CEOs in 2014, analysts were skeptical about the dual CEO structure. However, cloud software giants like Salesforce.com Inc () have followed suit. Catz, trained in finance and law, was a Wall Street banker from 1986 until she joined Oracle in 1999 and has been a central figure in Oracle's many acquisitions.  Sales-oriented Hurd spent 25 years at computer and ATM pioneer NCR Corp before joining HP. ","{'neg': 0.089, 'neu': 0.87, 'pos': 0.041, 'compound': -0.9468}",-0.9468
Supreme Court takes up challenge to consumer protection agency,Oct 19 2019,"WASHINGTON () - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a challenge backed by President Donald Trump's administration to the structure of a federal agency assigned to protect consumers in the financial sector that could undermine its independence from presidential interference. The nine justices will hear an appeal involving the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau brought by a law firm that had been investigated by the agency, arguing that its structure infringes on presidential powers as laid out in the U.S. Constitution. Trump and his fellow Republicans have sought to undermine the agency, created under his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama in 2011 in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Orange County, California-based law firm Seila Law LLC argues in the case that the entire agency should be struck down, but the most likely outcome - and the one urged by the Trump administration - is that the Supreme Court rule that the president can remove the CFPB's director at any time. The law firm lost in lower courts and appealed to the Supreme Court. The legal fight focuses on whether the single director of the agency, who is appointed by the president to a five-year term, has too much power because the president has limited authority to remove that individual from office. Seila Law argued that the structure violates the U.S. Constitution's separation of powers provisions that vest executive authority with the president and limit the power of Congress to encroach in that area. Trump's appointee to head the agency, Kathy Kraninger, took office in December 2018 over the objections of Democrats and consumer advocates. Under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that established the agency, the president can terminate a director only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.” Lawmakers wanted the agency to be independent from political interference. The challenge, one of several targeting the agency, was brought by Seila, which specializes in resolving consumer debt issues, in response to a February 2017 request from the CFPB demanding information and documents as part of an investigation into whether the firm had violated federal consumer financial law.  The law firm lost its claim in both the district court and on appeal to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled in May 2019 that the structure of the agency is constitutional. The Trump administration and the CFPB itself, reversing course on the position taken by the Obama administration, have said they agree with the challengers. The Supreme Court will likely have to appoint an outside lawyer to argue that the existing structure is constitutional. The CFPB was established in 2011 to crack down on predatory financial practices after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a contender for the Democratic nomination to run against Trump in the November 2020 election, played a key role in setting up the agency before she was elected to the Senate from Massachusetts. Ever since the CFPB was established, Republicans and the financial industry have sought to undercut its authority, objecting to its powers over a wide array of financial products and its structure. However, if Trump loses his re-election bid, a ruling in his favor in this case would make it easier for his successor - potentially Warren - to oust the current director and install a new leader for the agency. The Supreme Court, which has a 5-4 conservative majority, will hear arguments and issue a ruling in its current term, which runs until the end of June. One of the justices, conservative Brett Kavanaugh, is already on the record as to how he would resolve the case. Before he was appointed to the Supreme Court by Trump, Kavanaugh participated in another case as a federal appeals court judge. He dissented when that court in 2018 upheld the agency's structure. His proposed solution was the same as the proposal made by the Trump administration. That would be in line with how the Supreme Court resolved a challenge to another, more obscure, government entity called the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The court, in a decision authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, ruled on a 5-4 vote in 2010 that the board was unconstitutionally structured because the president did not have sufficient authority to remove board members. A similar legal challenge to the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Agency is also heading to the Supreme Court. ","{'neg': 0.078, 'neu': 0.81, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': 0.9704}",0.9704
JPMorgan's Dimon says Facebook's Libra currency 'will never happen',Oct 19 2019,"WASHINGTON () - Facebook's Libra digital currency project is “a neat idea that will never happen,” JPMorgan Chase  Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Friday, adding to scepticism about the project that has faced criticism from policymakers and some regulators. Dimon, who made the comments at an event in Washington hosted by the Institute of International Finance, did not elaborate on why he believed Libra was a non-starter. But the Wall Street Journal reported this week that JPMorgan had declined to join the project due to concerns the digital currency could be used for criminal activities that would violate money-laundering and sanctions rules. The ambitious efforts of Facebook Inc to establish a global digital currency have suffered severe setbacks in recent weeks, after several high profile partners including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and eBay abandoned the project.  The exodus followed a pushback from policymakers and regulators in the United States and Europe over concerns Libra could upend the global financial system, threaten users' privacy and facilitate money laundering. David Marcus, a Facebook executive who has been leading the project, said this week he expected to get 100 banks and financial firms on board once the project has addressed regulatory concerns.. Speaking to reporters Thursday night, Marcus said Libra did not need banks or payment firms to launch the system, however. He added that Libra intended to meet the highest possible regulatory standards, if not exceed them. Dimon has in the past been a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies and described bitcoin as a “fraud” in 2017. Back then Dimon said cryptocurrencies were “worse than tulips bulbs,” referring to a famous market bubble in the 1600s. He tempered his view a few months later, saying he regretted calling bitcoin a fraud, but maintained his disinterest in  cryptocurrencies. Still, JPMorgan made its own foray into the digital asset space in February, launching a “JPM Coin” to allow its clients to instantly transfer payments over a blockchain network. In a presentation on its website at the time, JPMorgan said it was supportive of “cryptocurrencies as long as they are properly controlled and regulated.” ","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.898, 'pos': 0.043, 'compound': -0.4678}",-0.4678
Late Representative Cummings to lie in state in U.S. Capitol,Oct 19 2019,"WASHINGTON () - The late U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings, one of a handful of Democrats leading an impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump, will be honored in the U.S. Capitol on Thursday when a coffin carrying his remains will lie in state in the National Statuary Hall. Cummings, 68, a civil rights champion and 22-year veteran of the House of Representatives, died on Thursday of complications from longstanding health problems. The African-American congressman will be honored in “Statuary Hall,” as it is known among those working in the Capitol. For several decades in the 1800s it served as the House chamber and was the site of debates over the nation's slavery policy. At the time of his death, Cummings, who represented the city of Baltimore and surrounding areas of Maryland, chaired the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. He became chairman in January when he and his fellow Democrats took majority control of the House. From that post, Cummings led investigations into Trump's personal finances and possible abuses at federal agencies. In late September, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched a formal impeachment investigation into Trump's dealings with Ukraine and designated the House's intelligence, foreign affairs and oversight committees to lead the probe. Members of Congress will attend a formal ceremony honoring Cummings on Thursday in Statuary Hall, an ornate room in the Capitol that holds statues contributed by the 50 U.S. states.

HIGHLIGHTS-Negative interest rates: Bankers at the IMF meeting weigh in,Oct 19 2019,"WASHINGTON, Oct 18 () - One of the hot topics of discussion at the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting was negative interest rates, which have been utilized by central banks in the euro zone and Japan to boost growth. The ECB cut rates deeper into negative territory last month and said it would restart asset purchases, igniting a rare public debate as a growing number of policymakers question the value of its deep foray into unconventional monetary policy. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan is laying the groundwork for deepening negative interest rates, analysts polled by  said, with two-thirds of respondents expecting the central bank to loosen monetary policy this month. The moves have raised a debate about the ammunition other major central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve have to fight a slowdown. Here are some comments made in the past few days: “What Europe is experiencing with negative rates, obviously is really bad. Not just for the financial sector, but for the broader economy. Do I worry about them being too low? Listen, the Fed's job is to manage the excesses and to prop up the weaknesses in any economic cycle. There's no rulebook that Jay Powell's got on his shelf behind saying at this point, with this information, you should do X. There's a judgment call. I personally would be more cautious bringing rates down because you are using up one of the tools that you have... At this point, I would probably price one more cut for the rest of the year, and then I would really sit back, watch and wait.” J.P. MORGAN CHASE'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE, JAMIE DIMON ON LESSONS FROM THE CASE IN EUROPE: “I think this is a lesson. I think they did it early on to save Europe basically from coming apart with the monetary union. We don't know. I think they'll be writing books about this in 50 to 75 years. “[Negative rates] has huge negatives for savers and low-income people, for investors and for the capital markets. I, personally, would not buy debt below zero… There's something irrational about it…I'm not sure the monetary rules are the same for a negative rate as they are for a positive one.” TOBIAS ADRIAN, FINANCIAL COUNSELLOR AND DIRECTOR OF THE IMF'S MONETARY AND CAPITAL MARKETS DEPARTMENT: “Remarkably, the amount of government and corporate bonds with negative yields has increased to about $15 trillion. Moreover, markets expect about one-fifth of government bonds will have negative yields for at least three years. With rates staying lower for longer, financial conditions have eased, helping contain downside risks and support global growth for now. But loose financial conditions have encouraged investors to take more risks in a quest to achieve their return targets.” DANIEL PINTO CO-PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF JP MORGAN CHASE INVESTMENT BANK, SPEAKING AT THE INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCE: “I think one of the problems with negative (interest) rates is that it tends to have less effect today than a few years ago. “Before this current interest rate environment, if rates were going to be so low for so long, we would have started to get worried about the future. But today, as the population gets older and their priorities change, the distribution of rate changes don't affect the economy as much. For our business, we prefer high interest rates more than low interest rates, but in general, it doesn't make much of a difference.” “In the insurance business and pension business, it makes more of a difference because they have certain liabilities that become more difficult to manage as rates go lower and lower.” RAY DALIO, FOUNDER OF GLOBAL MACRO HEDGE FUND BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES: Dalio said he was worried perpetually low or negative interest rates was creating a “crazy or odd” reality in which debtors barely had to service their debt. “Interest rates become negative or near negative so the debt service payments for the interest rate are down a lot. And it's almost a situation where there's guaranteed debt rollover.” Holzmann, one of the newest members of the ECB's policy panel, said negative interest rates are not sustainable over the long term and some financial sector players simply can't adjust. “Insurance companies and pension funds have no way to neutralize the negative rates and it becomes impossible to provide the rates of return individuals expect,” Holzmann said. He argued that given low returns, insurers and pension funds must take on more risk, which could then endanger financial stability. Holzmann also noted that ultra-low pension returns endanger European efforts to supplement a public pension system with a private pillar, another reason for the ECB to change its approach to negative rates. “Being very unconventional, I think we have to be very careful of the possible negative effects of negative rates,” Visco told a conference on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank fall meetings. “I would be very, very careful in going further in this direction.” Lowe said it was “extraordinarily unlikely” that negative interest rates would be implemented to meet the country's inflation and growth targets, adding that low rates alone were unlikely to stimulate investment.

"EU, China, others, team up to coordinate 'green' investment financing",Oct 19 2019,"WASHINGTON () - The European Union, China, India and several other countries teamed up on Friday to coordinate rules and standards for trillions of dollars of private and public “green” investment needed over decades to prevent irreversible climate change. The initiative, called the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF), also involves Argentina, Chile, Canada, Kenya and Morocco - a group responsible for 44% of the world's GDP and the same amount of carbon dioxide emissions. Its aim is not to raise money, but to harmonize rules on what is sustainable, or “green” investment, across the world so that private capital can flow into it more freely. “To deal with climate change Europe can only do so much, because Europe generates only around 9% of emissions,” European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told  on the sidelines of International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington where the initiative was launched. “While public funding will be vital for the transition, it cannot pay the massive bill alone. We also have to tap into private capital to raise the trillions needed,” he said. “No national budget can pay for that on its own. Nor should it. Countries should link their sustainable financing needs to global financial markets to scale up green investment at the level that the world needs,” he said. The European Union's executive arm, the European Commission, in June sought to boost the flow of private money to tackle climate change by publishing guidelines on what qualifies as environmentally friendly investment. But China and some others also have their own rules on that, which shows the need for a joint initiative to keep them harmonized to avoid market fragmentation, Dombrovskis said. The European Union has agreed to substantial reductions of carbon emissions by 2030 and the Commission wants the bloc to reduce them to zero by 2050 to help stop global warming, the rise of average worldwide temperatures. To cut emissions by 2030, many sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing, agriculture and energy, require an extra annual investment of between 180 and 290 billion euros and even more is needed to achieve zero emissions by 2050. “We need to have the international community on board and that is why we are launching the international platform for sustainable finance to exchange best practices, to coordinate our approach,” Dombrovskis said. The United States, the world's biggest economy which is also second biggest in terms of CO2 emissions after China, was conspicuously absent from the initiative as President Donald Trump maintains that global warming is a “hoax.” “The U.S. it is not among the founding members, but we see lots of interest from U.S. states, from the industry, from the financial sector,” Dombrovskis said.

Wisconsin county to lock in long-term financing for Foxconn project,Oct 19 2019,"CHICAGO () - Wisconsin's Racine County next week will lock in $110 million, 20-year financing for a major development by Taiwan's Foxconn Technology Group that has undergone changes in scope since it was announced in 2017, the county and a bank underwriting the bonds said. The planned $10 billion, 20-million-square-foot campus in the southeastern Wisconsin county had been hailed by the White House as the largest investment for a brand new location by a foreign-based company in U.S. history and proof that President Donald Trump was reviving American manufacturing.  But Foxconn's changing plans have raised doubts about how many jobs it will create. Foxconn initially sought to manufacture advanced large-screen displays for TVs and other consumer and professional products at the Wisconsin site. It later said it would build smaller Generation 6 liquid crystal display screens instead and is currently constructing a nearly 1 million-square-foot facility that will begin production in 2020's 4th quarter. Interim notes Racine County sold in 2017 and 2018 to finance land acquisition for Foxconn will be replaced with $110 million of taxable general obligation bonds carrying maturities from 2020 through 2039 in a deal pricing through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley. Howard Cure, a managing director at Evercore Wealth Management, said investors who buy the bonds the county hopes to pay off with special assessments on the Foxconn development will have to weigh the risks the county could face if the project falters.  “If you buy this paper you have to track the progress of Foxconn,” he said.  The sale of the bond anticipation notes, which greatly increased the county's debt burden, led Moody's Investors Service to downgrade the county's rating by a one-notch to Aa2 in 2017.  On Friday, Moody's affirmed the Aa2 rating and a negative outlook, which it said reflects the county's exposure to “risks and uncertainties” surrounding the Foxconn project.  While noting uncertainty over the size and scope of the project, S&P Global Ratings rated the bonds AA, saying that they do not substantially add to the county's debt burden or introduce substantial risk to its credit quality.  Racine County, which is putting its unlimited taxing power behind the bonds, said it has strong protections in its local development agreement with Foxconn. “We remain encouraged about the progress we've seen and continue to see each day on the ground,” Racine County Executive Jonathan Delagrave said in a statement. Still, the bond issue's prospectus said there is no guarantee whether there will be future amendments to Foxconn's contract with the state or if the facility will be constructed in accordance with the development agreement. It added that “no assurance can be provided as to the specific type, size, scope or generation of the facility” that is ultimately built. Wisconsin's Democratic Governor Tony Evers, who inherited the project from his Republican predecessor and Trump ally Scott Walker, had raised the possibility of renegotiating Foxconn's contract as the project's scope was in flux. The company fell short of a 2018 employment goal, hiring 178 full-time workers rather than the 260 targeted, and failed to earn a tax credit of up to $9.5 million. A spokesman for the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) said on Thursday the existing contract “remains in force” and that the company will submit its 2019 hiring report on Dec. 31. In an emailed response to questions, Foxconn Technology Group acknowledged “routine engagement and good faith discussions” with the Evers administration “regarding areas of flexibility within the exiting agreement.”  The company said it is moving forward with plans for a high-performance computing data center and still intends to create 13,000 new jobs.

Brexit deal 'good news' but global growth key for BoE rates too: Carney,Oct 19 2019,"WASHINGTON () - Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said Britain's planned Brexit deal would help the country's economy, but “almost existential” worries about global trade wars might prevent the BoE from raising interest rates. Carney said the deal, which still faces a key vote in Britain's parliament on Saturday, was “good news” because it means Britain could avoid what the BoE has warned would be a major economic shock: dropping out of the EU with no transition. Britain is due to leave the EU on Oct. 31, more than three years after voters shocked investors and employers by opting to take the country out of the world's biggest trading area. In an interview with Bloomberg Television at a meeting of the International Monetary Fund, Carney said clarity on Brexit would help to revive business investment that has fallen sharply since the 2016 referendum. In a separate interview with the BBC, Carney said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's deal might not help the economy to the same extent as his predecessor Theresa May's plan, which proposed closer ties with the EU but was rejected by parliament. Asked if securing a Brexit transition meant the BoE would resume raising rates, Carney said: “Not necessarily. I'm not going to pre-commit, there is a lot of contingencies there.” He said the IMF had stressed the precarious nature of the world economy, which has prompted other central banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to provide more stimulus. “We have to take that into account. How much momentum is there in the global economy?” Carney said. His comments echoed a statement by the BoE after its policy meeting in September when it said it expected to raise rates gradually, as long as a no-deal Brexit shock to the economy was avoided and global growth picked up. Later on Friday, Carney said that in 16 years of attending meetings at the IMF he had never seen the level of concern among global finance chiefs about barriers to trade. Asked to sum up the mood at the gathering, Carney described it as “the almost existential uncertainty about the structure of the trading system.”   The IMF this week warned that the U.S.-China trade war will cut 2019 global growth to its slowest pace since the financial crisis, and things could get a lot worse if the trade tensions remain unresolved.

"Exclusive: SEC probes oilfield firm ProPetro over accounting, disclosures - sources",Oct 19 2019,"() - Oilfield services supplier ProPetro Holding Corp is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over its financial disclosures, people familiar with the matter said this week. The SEC probe involves potential violations of securities laws covering disclosures, internal financial controls and public reporting by the Midland, Texas, company, one of the people said.  ProPetro in August disclosed that a board committee was reviewing its internal controls, related-party transactions and executive expense reimbursements. The company had also revised a statement on capital equipment purchases to show it would buy more equipment than earlier disclosed.  A spokesman for the company had no immediate comment. ProPetro provides equipment and services to pump chemicals, water and sand into the ground to release trapped shale oil and gas. The SEC declined to comment. ProPetro shares fell nearly 9% and were trading at $7.84 in afternoon trading after  disclosed the investigation.  Last week, a committee of directors said it had completed most of the fact-finding portion of its internal review but was continuing to examine related-party real estate transactions. The committee said it had not found anything that would require a restatement of past earnings. But it said it needed more time to evaluate “the impact of any identified material weaknesses” on prior filings, and could not rule out a restatement.  ProPetro, which reported $1.7 billion in revenue last year, has not filed its quarterly report for the second quarter ended June 30. It faces a potential delisting by the New York Stock Exchange for failing to meet its deadlines.   As a result of the board review, the company replaced its chief accountant and demoted co-founders Dale Redman and Jeffrey Smith. The pair also agreed to reimburse the company for $346,000 and $18,000, respectively, for expenses improperly billed to ProPetro, according to company disclosures. Redman retains his CEO title, but is no longer the principal executive. Former finance chief Smith was reassigned as chief administrative officer and his duties handed to an interim finance chief, the company said.  Other executives have resigned in recent months, including a director and general counsel Mark Howell. ProPetro was one of the few pressure pumping service companies to offer electric hydraulic fracturing equipment. Restatement of disclosures about purchases from AFGlobal of e-frac equipment, which it has said were under contract by Diamondback Energy and Exxon Mobil Corp, were part of what drove the board's review.

Czech Media Invest (CMI), owned by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky Tkac and Slovak partners Patrik Tkac and Roman Korbacka, confirmed the holding after it was earlier disclosed through a German regulatory filing. In a statement, CMI said the stake purchase was part of a strategy of building up a portfolio of minority stakes in media companies around Europe. “This investment is a result of the mandate from our shareholders to ensure further growth within the European media landscape,” CMI's finance director Branislav Miskovic said in a statement. “We expect ProSieben to be both a long-term and a strategic investment within our media portfolio,” it added, praising the strength of the ProSieben brand and its position on the German market.

"Lebanon, pushed to the brink, faces reckoning over graft",Oct 19 2019,"BEIRUT () - Lebanon is closer to a financial crisis than at any time since at least the war-torn 1980s as allies, investors and this week nationwide protests pile pressure on the government to tackle a corrupt system and enact long-promised reforms. Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri's government on Thursday hastily reversed a plan, announced hours earlier, to tax WhatsApp voice calls in the face of the biggest public protests in years, with people burning tyres and blocking roads. The country - among the world's most indebted  and quickly running out of dollar reserves - urgently needs to convince regional allies and Western donors it is finally serious about tackling entrenched problems such as its unreliable and wasteful electricity sector. Without a foreign funding boost, Lebanon risks a currency devaluation or even defaulting on debts within months, according to interviews with nearly 20 government officials, politicians, bankers and investors. Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil said in a televised speech on Friday that he gave a paper at an economic crisis meeting in September saying Lebanon needed “an electric shock”. “I also said that what little remains of the financial balance might not last us longer than the end of the year if we do not adopt the necessary policies,” he said, without describing what he meant by financial balance. Beirut has repeatedly vowed to maintain the value of the dollar-pegged Lebanese pound and honour its debts on time. But countries that in the past reliably financed bailouts have run out of patience with its mismanagement and graft, and they are using the deepening economic and social crisis to press for change, the sources told .  These include Arab Gulf states whose enthusiasm to help Lebanon has been undermined by the growing clout in Beirut of Tehran-backed Hezbollah, and what they see as a need to check Iran's growing influence across the Middle East.  Western countries have also provided funds that allowed Lebanon to defy gravity for years. But for the first time they have said no new money would flow until the government takes clear steps toward reforms it has long only promised. Their hope is to see it move towards fixing a system that sectarian politicians have used to deploy state resources to their own advantage through patronage networks instead of building a functional state. A crisis could stoke further unrest in a country hosting some 1 million refugees from neighbouring Syria, where a Turkish incursion in the northeast this month has opened a new front in an eight-year war. “If the situation remains, and there are no radical reforms, a devaluation of the currency is inevitable,” said Toufic Gaspard, a former adviser to Lebanon's finance ministry and former economist at its central bank and the International Monetary Fund.  “Since September a new era has begun,” he added. “The red flags are large and everywhere, especially with the central bank paying up to 13% to borrow dollars.”  The first reform on Beirut's agenda is one of the most intractable: fixing chronic power outages that make private generators a costly necessity, a problem many see as the main symbol of corruption that has left services unreliable and infrastructure crumbling. Hariri, in a televised speech to the nation, said he had been struggling to reform the electricity sector ever since taking office. After “meeting after meeting, committee after committee, proposal after proposal, I got at last to the final step and someone came and said ‘it doesn't work',” he said. Presenting the difficulties of implementing reform more widely, Hariri said every committee required a minimum of nine ministers to keep everyone happy. “A national unity government? OK, we understand that. But committees of national unity? The result is that nothing works.” Underscoring the pressure from abroad, Pierre Duquesne, a French ambassador handling so-called CEDRE funding, is traveling to Lebanon next week to press the government on the use of offshore power barges, a banker familiar with the plan said. Duquesne wants the barges included in the electricity overhaul plan, the person said, requesting anonymity. Duquesne could not immediately be reached for comment. The contents of the 2020 budget will be key to helping unlock some $11 billion conditionally pledged by international donors under last year's CEDRE conference. But a cabinet meeting on the budget set for Friday was cancelled amid the protests. Hariri's government, which includes nearly all of Lebanon's main parties, had proposed a tax of 20 cents per day on calls via voice-over-internet protocol (VoIP) used by applications including WhatsApp, Facebook and FaceTime. In a country fractured along sectarian lines, the protests' unusually wide geographic reach may be a sign of deepening anger with politicians who have jointly led Lebanon into crisis. Fires were smoldering in central Beirut, where streets were scattered with glass of several smashed shop-fronts. Tear gas was fired on some demonstrators. The newspaper an-Nahar described it as “a tax intifada”, or uprising. Another daily, al-Akhbar, declared it “the WhatsApp revolution”. “With this corrupt authority, our kids have no future,” said protestor Fadi Issa, 51. “We don't just want a resignation, we want accountability. They should return all the money they stole. We want change.” As confidence has faded and dollars have grown scarce, new cracks have emerged between Lebanon's government and its private lenders, according to several of the bankers, investors and officials who spoke to . After years of funding the government with the promise of ever higher rates of return, the banks - sensing the country is approaching collapse - are pressing for it to finally deliver reforms to win over donors. Most said Lebanon would likely feel more economic and financial strain in the months ahead but avoid haircuts on deposits or a worst-case sovereign default. Yet Beirut's years of failure to deliver reforms and the new determination among its traditional donors to press for them has left even top officials, bankers and investors divided over whether a devaluation is in store for the Lebanese pound. “You need a positive shock. But unfortunately the government thinks reforms can happen without touching the structure that benefits them,” said Nassib Ghobril, head of economic research and analysis at Byblos Bank. Lebanon must promote reforms to increase capital inflows, he said. “We can't keep going to the Emirates and Saudis. We need to help ourselves in order for others to help us.” This month, Moody's put Lebanon's Caa1 credit rating under review for a downgrade and estimated the central bank, which has stepped in to cover government debt payments, had only $6 billion-$10 billion in useable dollars left to maintain stability. That compares with some $6.5 billion in debt maturing by the end of next year. The central bank says its foreign assets stood at $38.1 billion as of Oct. 15. An official told  Lebanon has only $10 billion in real reserves. “It is a very dire situation that has five months to correct itself or there will be a collapse, around February,” he said. Hariri's government may have only a few months to deliver fiscal reforms to convince France, the World Bank and other parties to the CEDRE agreement to unlock $11 billion in conditional funding. The head of regional investments for a large U.S. asset manager said Lebanese officials are privately saying a plan that addresses short- and long-term electricity shortages will be announced before year end, after which the government will raise tariffs.  But critics say no concrete steps have been taken despite energy ministry statements that the plan is on track.  Hariri left Paris last month with no immediate cash commitment after visiting French President Emmanuel Macron. Likewise this month he left Abu Dhabi empty-handed after meeting Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan. Lawmakers in Beirut struggled to explain what happened in Abu Dhabi after Hariri claimed the United Arab Emirates had promised investments following “positive” talks.  Investors, bankers and economists say at least $10 billion is needed to renew confidence among the Lebanese diaspora whom for decades have underpinned the economy by maintaining accounts back home.  But so far this year, deposits have shrunk by about 0.4%.  The government has sought a smaller cushion from Sunni Muslim allies to buy some time. But to secure funding from the UAE or Saudi Arabia, Beirut would likely have to meet conditions meant to weaken Shi'ite Hezbollah's hand in Lebanon's government, said several sources. Hezbollah, which faces U.S. sanctions, is seen to be gaining more control over state resources by naming the health minister in January after last year's elections brought more of its allies into the legislature. Some say Saudi Arabia, UAE and the United States are motivated to hold out on Beirut as part of their wider policy seeking to weaken Iran and its allies which have been fighting proxy wars with Gulf Arab states on several fronts. “Their tolerance of Iran and Hezbollah has lowered significantly. The ‘Lebanese exception' is gone,” said Sami Nader, Beirut-based director of the Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs. “The balance has tilted and we are now at odds with our former friends because Hezbollah now has the upper hand politically.” The former regional head at a major Western bank put it bluntly: “People have lost patience with the corruption in which a frozen Parliament with no authority is simply divvying up the pie among politicians.” “But at the end of the day the Lebanese political class usually succeeds in convincing allies that they should not let the system collapse and bring civil war again,” he added.  Lebanon, straddling the Middle East's main sectarian lines, was historically the region's foreign-exchange hub into which deposits flowed, especially since 1997 when its currency was pegged to the dollar at 1,507.5 pounds.  But after a reckoning in August and September in which the cost of insuring Lebanon's sovereign debt surged  to a record high, things have changed. Depositors, including the diaspora drawn by rates much higher than in Europe or the United States, are pulling funds in the face of Lebanon's swelling twin deficits, inability to secure foreign funding, and unorthodox central bank efforts to attract dollar inflows.  Among Lebanon's 6 million citizens, trust has worn thin.  Depositors can no longer easily withdraw dollars, and most ATMs no longer provide them, forcing people to turn to so-called parallel FX markets where $1 is worth more than the official peg. “I am with the protesters,” said Walid al-Badawi, 43. “I have three children, I am a taxi driver, I work all day to get food for my kids and I can't get it.” Gaspard, the central bank's former research head, said foreign exchange was easy even through Lebanon's 15-year civil war. There was also always a balance of payments surplus - until 2011 when deficits began to grow, reaching $12 billion last year.  Three events precipitated the crisis of confidence that for years seemed inevitable: a series of central bank efforts since 2016 to keep growing deposits with rates of more than 11% on large deposits; a public sector pay hike last year that raised the budget deficit to more than 11% of GDP; low oil prices in recent years that have weakened Gulf allies.   In a report on Thursday the IMF described Lebanon's position as “very difficult,” adding “substantial new measures” are needed to protect it and reduce large deficits. As dollars have dried up, banks have effectively stopped lending and can no longer make basic foreign-exchange transactions for clients, one banker said. “The whole role of banks is to pour money into the central bank to finance the government and protect the currency,” he said. “Nothing is being done on the fiscal deficit because doing something will disrupt the systems of corruption.” The resistance from banks has been subtle but telling given their central role in financing the government.  When Beirut proposed a $660 million reduction in debt service costs in its 2019 budget, banks never signed up to the idea. They have also been less enthusiastic about subscribing to Eurobonds including a planned $2-billion issuance later this month, officials said. Without reform, “banks agree we can no longer support the public sector,” said Byblos Bank's Ghobril. ","{'neg': 0.086, 'neu': 0.83, 'pos': 0.084, 'compound': 0.8798}",0.8798
EU looks beyond new tariffs to bigger trade deal,Oct 19 2019,"WASHINGTON () - European officials struck a measured tone on Friday after the United States imposed new 10% and 25% tariffs on some European Union goods over aircraft subsidies, with a top German official warning against steps that could escalate the tensions. German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz on Friday said European Union officials were working intensively to hammer out a broader trade deal with the United States and avert additional, potentially far more devastating tariffs on European-built cars. Asked about new U.S. tariffs on up to $7.5 billion worth of EU airplanes, cheese, wine and other imports that took effect on Friday, Scholz said he favored a “firm, clear and decisive” approach that did not further escalate the situation. “I think it will work at the end of the day,” he told reporters during the IMF/World Bank annual meetings. In Brussels, EU trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom said the EU would respond with its own tariffs “in due course” when its own case against Boeing () is adjudicated in early 2020. Despite some initial suggestions it could do so, there was no move by Brussels to impose any immediate retaliatory tariffs against the United States under earlier WTO rulings. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Friday said the EU was working on measures to compensate sectors hit by the new U.S. duties and “limit damages for those directly hit.” The WTO has found that both Airbus () and its U.S. rival Boeing received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies in a pair of cases that have run for 15 years. The U.S. tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU imports took effect Friday.  The WTO's dispute settlement body on Monday cleared Washington to take the record countermeasures against the EU and Airbus-producing countries Britain, France, Germany and Spain. The actions include 10% duties on Airbus planes and additional 25% duties on a wide swath of French wine, Scottish whiskies and cheeses from across Europe. Fifteen international beverage groups on Friday urged the U.S. and EU governments to end the tariffs. “Our industries are collateral damage in trade disputes that have nothing to do with the beverage alcohol sector,” the groups said in a statement. “This new round of tariffs will further damage a transatlantic industry that has already been negatively impacted by the EU's retaliatory tariff on American Whiskey.” They said the new U.S. tariffs on EU spirits and wines could result in the loss of 8,000 good-paying jobs across the U.S. beverage alcohol sector, from importers, distributors, wholesalers, to the hospitality sector. U.S. President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have recently downplayed tensions with Brussels, raising the prospect that they could once again delay threatened national security tariffs against European cars.

RPT-Mexico shifts oil hedging formula to new export realities,Oct 19 2019,"(Repeats to additional subscribers with no changes to text) By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Stefanie  Eschenbacher NEW YORK/MEXICO CITY, Oct 18 () - Mexico's new crude oil formulas that underpin its export sales and oil hedging program highlight the growing reach of U.S. crude exports and Mexico's decision to rely on more liquid, heavily-traded international contracts. The nation's state-run energy company Pemex late Thursday released details of how it will calculate its formula to hedge against upcoming sales of Maya crude, its flagship grade. The finance ministry worked in tandem with Pemex to simplify the crude sales formulas - eliminating a number of different components it has used in the past. Pemex sets formulas that dictate the price at which Mexico's crude is sold worldwide. A top finance ministry official told  the formula's structure had not been changed in two decades. Now, the formula's biggest component for pricing sales of Maya exported to the U.S. Gulf Coast will be U.S. West Texas Intermediate delivered to East Houston (MEH), rather than a number of other grades of oil.  reported last month that the energy ministry had included the popular U.S. export grade. Houston is swiftly catching up to Cushing, Oklahoma as a key barometer for the health of U.S. crude supply as U.S. crude exports have surged to a record above 3 million barrels per day (bpd). The new formulas also replace dated Brent, which is considered the benchmark assessment of the price of physical, light North Sea crude oil, with the more liquid Intercontinental Exchange Brent for Maya sales to the Americas, Europe, India and the Middle East. ICE Brent is one of the most actively traded futures contracts on that exchange. “The new formula will be much easer to hedge as there's much more liquidity and transparency. Maya crude hedge risk has been simplified into WTI-Brent spread, which has been minimal and continues to contract,” said Ryan Dusek, director at Opportune LLP's commodity risk advisory practice. The last major change to the formulas involve cutting out exports of high-sulfur fuel oil, which has historically been a component of Mexico's exports but is set to be banned next year due to high emissions. The new formulas are set to take effect from December. The current formula for Maya crude sales to the Gulf Coast includes two U.S. crude grades, Louisiana Light Sweet (LLS) and West Texas Sour (WTS), along with U.S. Gulf Coast high sulfur fuel oil. Those are being removed. Mexico's sales to Europe, India and the Middle East will no longer include fuel oil either. High sulfur fuel oil is one of the dirtiest and cheapest products to come out of a refinery and has been the fuel of choice in global shipping for decades. Shipping demand is expected to evaporate after new International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules take effect on Jan. 1. ","{'neg': 0.1, 'neu': 0.854, 'pos': 0.046, 'compound': -0.985}",-0.985
Global trade uncertainty a reason to ratify USMCA: Mexican minister,Oct 19 2019,"WASHINGTON () - Mexican Finance Minister Arturo Herrera said on Friday the current global uncertainty over trade is another reason to ratify the agreement negotiated last year between his country, the United States and Canada. Herrera, speaking on the sidelines of the fall meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington, said a common topic during a meeting of the Group of 20 late on Thursday had been the concern about trade tensions worldwide. The United States and China, the world's top two economies, have been in a 15-month trade war that the IMF said is partly to blame for a sharp slowdown in global growth. “It is clear for everybody that this is a topic of great concern and these tensions have happened at the same time in which we are seeing a cyclical slowdown of the economy,” Herrera said. “In particular in these uncertain times it would be better to have clarity for the next 16 years,” he added, referring to a sunset clause in the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which could be extended 16 years after implementation. The USMCA, which would replace the $1 trillion North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) still in effect, risks getting bogged down in the 2020 U.S. presidential election race if U.S. lawmakers do not ratify it soon. “In a world that is probably facing some uncertainties for a while,” Herrera said, ratifying the USMCA “is going to help attract investments to the region.” Mexico has already ratified the agreement, while Canada has not. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Thursday promised wage increases and funding for the implementation of labor reforms, part of a campaign to convince U.S. Democratic lawmakers to ratify the deal. USMCA was negotiated last year after U.S. President Donald Trump said the existing NAFTA deal was unfavorable to U.S. workers and businesses.

"Sudan, rebel groups agree on roadmap for peace talks",Oct 19 2019,"JUBA/KHARTOUM () - Sudan and a major rebel group agreed on Friday to a roadmap that will allow suspended peace talks to resume, giving new impetus to efforts by the government to end multiple conflicts around the country, the two sides said.  The government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) agreed that the focus of the negotiations would be political issues first, followed by humanitarian concerns and then security arrangements. Friday's announcement came during peace talks between the government and multiple rebel groups, hosted by neighboring South Sudan. Negotiations will continue over the weekend.  Sudan's ruling council and rebel groups restarted peace talks on Monday to end years-long conflicts, a prerequisite for the United States to remove Sudan from its list of sponsors of terrorism. The talks were partly suspended on Wednesday after the SPLM-N, a rebel group in the southern states of Blue Nile and South Kordofan, accused Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Force of occupying new areas and attacking and arresting traders. SPLM-N spokesman Al-Jack Mahmoud Al-Jack told  that the government had agreed to the group's demands to restart talks.  “We suspended the negotiations due to the violations committed by the government,” Jack said. “The government has withdrawn its forces ... and it declared cessation of hostilities plus released the detained people.”  The government confirmed negotiations would resume on Saturday. “The government is ready to start discussions tomorrow on the three points agreed upon,” said government spokesman Mohamed Eltaishi.  Sudan is being ruled by a transitional government after a coup overthrew longtime dictator Omar al Bashir in April following months of deadly protests. The new government is anxious to make peace with rebels.   Cash-strapped Khartoum is in desperate need of debt relief and financing from lenders such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.  But its designation as a state sponsor of terrorism has cut it off from such support. Removal from the list could also potentially open the door for foreign investment.

Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency should be prevented: German finance minister,Oct 19 2019,"WASHINGTON () - German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz on Friday redoubled his criticism of Facebook's plans to launch its Libra cryptocurrency, and said creation of a new world currency should be prevented.

Lemann-backed Brazil school chain Eleva to raise $200 million to expand: sources,Oct 19 2019,"SAO PAULO () - Brazilian K-12 school chain Eleva Educação SA is in talks with investors to raise around $200 million in a new financing round to fund expansion, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. Eleva is backed by Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, one of the three founders of private equity firm 3G Capital, a controlling shareholder at companies such as Anheuser Busch Inbev, Kraft Heinz co and Restaurant Brands International. Eleva's move comes as investors are targeting private K-12 school chains in Brazil, expecting strong growth, given the poor quality of public schools in Brazil. The school network, which also has a learning system, has doubled its number of students to 70,000 in the last two years and expanded geographically through acquisitions, with 115 schools across eight states. Its revenue is expected to reach 1 billion reais  ($240 million) this year. Eleva was founded by Gera Capital, a Brazilian asset management firm focused on impact sectors.  Proceeds from the new round of financing will be used to fund acquisitions and organic growth. A small portion of the proceeds may also be raised by existing shareholders, although there has been no decision on it yet. Other Brazilian education groups have been investing in expansion of K-12 private schools, such as Cogna Educacao, formerly known as Kroton Educacional, with its division Saber.  Businessman Chaim Zaher, founder of Yduqs , formerly known as Estacio Participacoes SA, is also investing in K-12 schools through his privately held holding.  Besides Lemann, Eleva has among its shareholders private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC, which acquired a roughly 25% stake in Eleva for 300 million reais in 2017, in a round that valued the company at 1.3 billion reais. Itau Unibanco Holding SA's investment banking unit is advising Eleva in the capital raising. Eleva did not immediately comment on the matter.

"Singapore, US ink pact on infrastructure finance and market building",Oct 19 2019,"Singapore and the United States have inked a pact to strengthen cooperation in infrastructure finance and market building.Grace Ho The agreement was signed on Wednesday in Washington by Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Finance and Education Indranee Rajah and US Deputy Treasury Secretary Justin Muzinich. It took place on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G-20) Finance Ministers' and Central Bank Governors' Meeting and annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group. A Ministry of Finance (MOF) statement said the agreement builds on the broader cooperation between the two countries to facilitate technical exchanges and information sharing, support infrastructure development in South-east Asia and promote private sector investments. The measures may include crowding in institutional investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, and developing regional debt markets for infrastructure financing. The new pact will be implemented by agencies such as the MOF, Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). During a roundtable with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on Thursday, Ms Indranee said that Singapore, with its vibrant infrastructure ecosystem, can be a valuable partner for the US. More than half, or 60 per cent, of project finance transactions in Asean are now arranged by Singapore-based banks. The Republic has introduced the Singapore Infrastructure Dispute-Management Protocol, where a panel of experts gives advice to solve infrastructure disputes at an early stage. Ms Indranee also welcomed the setting up of the US International Development Finance Corporation, a federal agency that aims to finance development projects. ""We hope that it will step up its engagements with countries in the Asian region and broker more infrastructure deals that will contribute to shared prosperity,"" she said. Ms Indranee is on a six-day visit to Chile and the US that ends today. She is accompanied by officials from the MOF, MAS, Enterprise Singapore and Infrastructure Asia. The latest agreement follows five other pacts Singapore signed during the Asia Infrastructure Forum in the first week of this month, including with Cambodia, Indonesia and the Philippines.","{'neg': 0.012, 'neu': 0.861, 'pos': 0.127, 'compound': 0.9894}",0.9894

"Pain from US trade wars a key topic at IMF, World Bank meet",Oct 21 2019,"WASHINGTON • The collateral damage of the United States' trade wars is being felt from the fjords of Iceland to the auto factories of Japan. Central bank governors and finance ministers traded grim tales of suffering economies at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank autumn meetings in Washington last week. Some also noted how far US policy has shifted from the 1940s, when Washington co-founded the IMF. At that time, ""the world economy had been hammered for over a decade by high tariff barriers, depression and war"", prompting then-US Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau to champion a global economic system, World Bank president David Malpass told attendees at a session last week. The US message then, Mr Malpass said, was: ""First, there's no limit to prosperity. Second, broadly shared prosperity benefits everyone."" As the IMF's gathering of 189 member nations drew to a close, the unintended negative impacts of the trade wars were becoming clear, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said. ""Everybody loses."" The US, the world's largest importer, started a bitter tariff war with China, the world's largest exporter, 15 months ago. And President Donald Trump is in the midst of renegotiating, and sometimes upending, trade ties with many of the US' top trading partners. The fallout will slow global growth this year to 3 per cent, the slowest pace in a decade, the IMF said in its latest estimate. The damage is being particularly felt in European countries which ""rely on exports and are open to trade"". Countries that do not rely on exports are hit too. Iceland built foreign currency reserves on the back of an increase in visitors, but those are dropping. Japan's Cabinet Office has downgraded its assessment of factory output for October. The softness in production was largely due to car exports to the US turning weaker, a government official said. The trade tensions are helping to spur a push among African nations to create a more self-reliant continent. ""We must take it upon ourselves to grow trade among ourselves,"" said a Kenyan official. Peru cut its 2019 economic growth estimate to 3 per cent in August, from 4.2 per cent. Mexico is edging closer to a recession that may be more difficult to reverse than during the last downturn over a decade ago. This pain is not being shared equally. The US remains the least exposed of the world's 20 largest economies to a drop in exports in part because of its massive domestic consumer spending base. The damage is being particularly felt in European countries which ""rely on exports and are open to trade"", the European Union's economic and financial affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici said. More than 40 per cent of Germany's GDP was derived from exports last year, the most of any major global economy. Uncertainty in the business community is widespread, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told reporters. German trade group BGA recently revised down its growth forecast for the country's exports this year to just 0.5 per cent, from 1.5 per cent. As a result, many companies are scaling back their investment plans, something that will have repercussions for years to come. Mr Scholz said concerns over Britain's impending departure from the EU and the bloc's trade dispute with the US were clearly dampening global economic growth. ""The most important problem remains those factors that we cannot measure - specifically the reluctance to invest,"" Mr Scholz said. The pain is also being felt in countries that do not rely on exports, such as Iceland, which became the first developed economy to seek aid from the IMF after a 2008 banking collapse. Since then, it has rebuilt its economy in what has been called a miraculous recovery. Now, that is threatened. Iceland, with a population of about 300,000, built foreign currency reserves on the back of the increase in visitors, governor of Iceland's central bank Asgeir Jonsson said, but those are dropping too. Trade links between countries have led to a more peaceful world in recent decades, but recent experience shows ""you can never take global trade for granted"", he said. Last Friday, Japan's Cabinet Office, which helps coordinate government policy, downgraded its assessment of factory output for October. The softness in production was largely due to car exports to the US turning weaker, after growing steadily until the spring, a government official said. The US has not been totally spared the impact of the trade wars. American farmers have been particularly hurt by Chinese tariffs on US agricultural products, prompting the Trump administration to give billions in aid to the farm belt. Washington's imposition of steel and aluminium tariffs, and uncertainty about passage of a new North American free trade deal - the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement - have also stalled local economic development. The trade tensions are helping to spur a push among African nations to create a more self-reliant continent. ""We must take it upon ourselves to grow trade among ourselves,"" said Kenya's Acting Cabinet Secretary for Treasury Ukur Yatani Kanacho. Senegal's Finance Minister Abdoulaye Daouda Diallo told reporters the US-China trade tensions would affect African nations in the energy sector and cut funds available on financial markets. The dispute underscored the importance of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, he said. Other emerging markets are also coming under pressure. ""Ukrainian exporters faced worsened conditions in global commodity markets,"" which drove down steel prices, said Ms Kateryna Rozhkova, the deputy governor of the country's central bank.

Mr Christopher Cabaldon, the mayor of West Sacramento, California, said bids for a US$100 million (S$136.46 million) infrastructure project in the city came in 80 per cent higher than expected in part because of construction firms' need to factor in higher costs and the risk of additional tariffs in the future. ""Even in small cities like my own, we see the impacts of trade.

Tharman gets award for contributions to global economy,Oct 19 2019,"WASHINGTON • Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam has received an award for his contributions to global financial governance and public service from an international finance industry association.Charissa Yong The Institute of International Finance (IIF) awarded him and Bank of England governor Mark Carney its first Distinguished Leadership and Service Award on Thursday. The award recognises individuals who have made distinguished and sustained contributions to the health of the global economy and financial system through their leadership, the IIF said in a statement. The finance industry's global association is based in Washington DC. It has more than 450 members from over 70 countries, including commercial and investment banks, sovereign wealth funds, central banks and development banks. IIF president and chief executive Timothy Adams presented Mr Tharman the award at the association's annual meeting in Washington. Said Mr Adams: ""You're a visionary, there's no doubt about it, and you should be recognised as a leading proponent of global reforms to de-risk and grow development finance and to achieve more resilient capital flows. ""Your ability to see around the corner and consider both the economic implications and the possibilities from the senior banker's perspective is incredibly unique and highly valued, and everybody around the world recognises your unique skills and talents."" Mr Tharman, who is in Washington until tomorrow for the annual meetings of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund, said in a statement: ""It is my privilege to receive this award from the IIF. It is to the credit of my colleagues at the Monetary Authority of Singapore and in the Singapore Government, and internationally, whom I have been working with to build resilient and growth-oriented financial markets. ""There is still much to be done to put in place the cooperative international networks and global financial reforms needed for more inclusive and sustainable growth."" Mr Tharman is also Coordinating Minister for Social Policies and chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. He currently chairs the Group of 30, a group of leading economists and policymakers from around the world. In a wide-ranging fireside chat with Mr Adams after receiving the award, Mr Tharman said that what was truly unusual in the global economy today was a confluence of different uncertainties, ranging from geopolitical to domestic political concerns, such as the future evolution of liberal democracies. ""We're profoundly concerned. The prospect of a bifurcation, fragmentation of global supply chains, the way in which tech adds value and creates productivity, is a fundamental uncertainty now facing the global economy,"" said Mr Tharman. Investment is also weak across the global economy because of this confluence of uncertainties that cannot be priced and are dampening investment in a whole set of sectors, he added. Mr Tharman also warned of what he called slow-burn issues, such as climate change mitigation, the renewal of infrastructure and the pensions crisis - meaning the future inability of governments to fund their public pension systems. ""It's a looming crisis across the advanced world, and defined contribution and democratisation of pensions hasn't worked out the way it was meant to,"" he said. ""A slow-burn issue, but slow-burning issues eventually end up in a fire. ""There's a massive need to address the slow-burn pensions crisis, because it's unsustainable and if we don't sort it out, it's going to pose an inequitable burden on the next generation,"" he said. VISIONARY WITH UNIQUE SKILLS MR TIMOTHY ADAMS, president and chief executive of the Institute of International Finance, on Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam. He called these profound uncertainties over the future - as well as the profound denial over the nature of the problem - a global issue. Addressing these issues requires a long-term orientation in fiscal policy, but such an orientation is possible only with ""faith in the centre of politics"", he said. ""Without trust in politics and institutions, it's very hard to take a long-term perspective of things. Things reduce themselves to what happens in the next elections.""","{'neg': 0.065, 'neu': 0.864, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': -0.3604}",-0.3604
OCBC seeks more green loans to maintain lead in South-east Asia,Oct 21 2019,"SINGAPORE () - Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp aims to expand its lending to environmentally-friendly projects after this year building the biggest exposure to green loans among its South-east Asian peers. The bank has built a team of five to focus on sustainable financing after foraying into green loans last year and is looking to add bankers, said Mike Ng, the Singapore bank's head of structured and sustainable finance. So far in 2019, OCBC has participated in more than US$500 million (S$682 million) of green lending, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. More banks in Asia are piling into environmentally-focused loans after a regional association last year agreed on principles that standardize disclosure rules. While that should boost lending in the area, Asia has a lot of ground to make up. It accounts for just 21 per cent, or US$217 billion, of the total US$1.02 trillion of sustainable debt globally, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data. ""There's much greater awareness now and a lot of pressure points on companies such as investors, non-government organisations, consumers and regulators,"" Mr Ng said in an interview last week. OCBC wants to build a sustainable finance portfolio of $10 billion by 2022, and is almost halfway toward that goal, Mr Ng said. The target will include lending classified as green loans as well as focused on environmental, social and governance initiatives, renewable energy, water and green transportation, he said. Mr Ng said OCBC started extending green loans after the Asia Pacific Loan Market Association (APLMA) laid out principles aimed at increasing transparency on the use of proceeds and on the environmental impact of projects. The bank's largest publicly disclosed green loan this year came from its involvement in the consortium providing $785 million to Frasers Property in March. The five-year term loan under the APLMA framework involves refinancing for a new wing of the Northpoint City project in Singapore, which uses low emissivity double-glazed glass and recycled water for toilet flushing.

Wirecard hires KPMG for independent audit after latest FT allegations,Oct 21 2019,"BERLIN () - German payments company Wirecard has hired KPMG to conduct an independent audit to  (FT) that its finance team had sought to inflate reported sales and profits, it said on Monday (Oct 21). The company, promoted to the DAX blue-chip index last year, has been the target of a series of investigative reports by FT reporter Dan McCrum, with the latest, on Oct 15, knocking more than 20 per cent off its share price. It has rejected the newspaper's latest allegations, based on internal spreadsheets and correspondence, that Wirecard's senior finance team had sought to inflate reported sales and profits at its businesses in Dubai and Ireland. The FT's reporting has however led to calls on Wirecard from investors and corporate governance advocates to hire an outside auditor both to clear up the matter and to demonstrate that it meets the governance standards of a top-tier public company. ""We have complete confidence in the audit procedures performed to date and their results. We assume this renewed independent review will lead to a final end to all further speculation,"" Wulf Matthias, chairman of Wirecard AG's supervisory board, said in a statement. Wirecard shares rose by 3.5 per cent in pre-market trading in Frankfurt. The audit will begin immediately, Wirecard said, adding that KPMG would report to the company's supervisory board and have unrestricted access to information at all levels of the group.

It has accused the FT and reporter McCrum of colluding with short sellers, as well as suing the newspaper. FT editor Lionel Barber has said  found no evidence to support those claims. In-house auditor EY signed off on Wirecard's 2018 accounts in April after an earlier FT story alleged fraud and false accounting at the company's Singapore office.

""Even if Mr Johnson does manage to close the deal, investor celebration of this might soon be dampened by the recognition that this is a fairly hard Brexit,"" said Janus Henderson fund manager Paul O'Connor. Britain's Finance Ministry and almost all external economists have forecast that increased trade barriers will cause the British economy to grow more slowly than if it were to stay in the EU, and the damage increases as trade barriers rise. Based on what was known of Mr Johnson's plans last week, think-tank UK In A Changing Europe estimated that trade barriers would make Britons more than 6 per cent poorer on a per capita basis than staying in the EU - equivalent to £2,000 (S$3,500) per year in the medium term. Mrs May's deal would have reduced income by just under 5 per cent per head, while a no-deal Brexit, which would leave Britain trading purely on World Trade Organisation terms, would lower incomes by just over 8 per cent.","{'neg': 0.062, 'neu': 0.886, 'pos': 0.052, 'compound': -0.4215}",-0.4215

Trump drops plan to host summit at his Florida golf resort,Oct 21 2019,"WASHINGTON • US President Donald Trump has abandoned plans to host next year's Group of Seven (G-7) summit at his Florida golf resort, after Democrats and others decried the selection as evidence of the President misusing his office for personal gain. In a series of tweets last Saturday, Mr Trump said he would drop the plan announced two days earlier by White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to host the meeting at the Trump National Doral golf resort near Miami from June 10 to 12. Mr Trump cited what he termed ""Crazed and Irrational Hostility"" from Democrats and the news media in explaining the reversal. ""We will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately,"" he wrote. The Republican President faces criticism and a number of congressional probes over his finances and potential conflicts of interest stemming from his real estate business, which he still owns, and an impeachment inquiry into accusations that he pursued political interests in his dealings with Ukraine. Mr Trump sought in his unusual reversal to emphasise what he said were the resort's positive features for hosting a large gathering. ""I thought I was doing something very good for our Country,"" he wrote on Twitter. The US Constitution's emoluments clause prohibits government officials from receiving salaries, fees or profits from foreign and domestic governments without congressional approval. Watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said last Saturday that the initial decision to award the event to a Trump property was ""stunningly corrupt"" but the ""reversal shows that pressure works"". ""The President deserves no plaudits for doing the right thing only after public outcry forced him not to do the wrong thing,"" it said. Democrats have said they would investigate Mr Trump's plan to host the G-7 summit at his property after he floated the idea in August. The decision also sparked criticism from a number of Republicans. In a statement last Thursday, House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler called the announcement ""among the most brazen examples yet of the President's corruption"". Mr Nadler also said the committee would continue investigating ""regarding these matters"". The announcement prompted requests from Democrats for detailed records from the White House to explain why 11 other sites were not chosen and how much taxpayers would pay. In May, the Washington Post reported that the Doral's operating income had fallen 69 per cent since 2015, citing company documents that it reviewed. Mr Mulvaney had suggested on Thursday that Mr Trump would not profit from use of the property because any charges would be ""at cost"".","{'neg': 0.105, 'neu': 0.858, 'pos': 0.037, 'compound': -0.9844}",-0.9844

Japan exports drop for 10th month in September as global slowdown weighs,Oct 21 2019,"TOKYO () - Japan's exports dropped for a tenth month in September as the global slowdown continues to batter manufacturers with overseas markets. Shipments abroad fell 5.2 per cent to extend the longest declining streak since 2016, according to a report released by the Ministry of Finance on Monday (Oct 21). The median estimate of economists was for a 3.7 per cent decrease. The data come ahead of a Bank of Japan review of the economy and inflation later this month that some analysts have seen as a signal of impending action from the central bank. A critical question for the BOJ is whether weakness in exports will spread to domestic demand and pull down inflation. Any delay to a recovery in the global economy would come at a vulnerable time for Japan's economy with a sales tax hike implemented this month likely to weaken consumer spending and shrink economic growth in the last quarter. While a truce in the US-China trade war could lower the risks faced by the global economy, it remains to be seen how both processes will evolve and what the effect will be on trade at home and abroad. Economists are increasingly taking the view that the global IT cycle may have hit the bottom. That could provide a lift for Japan's exports going forward. Looking ahead, a strong yen and slowing external demand - as highlighted by the IMF's cut in its global growth forecasts - will continue to weigh on Japan's exports, said Bloomberg economists.

Singaporeans expect inflation to inch up to 3.2% in coming year: DBS-SMU poll,Oct 21 2019,"SINGAPORE - Singaporeans believe overall or headline inflation will rise slightly to 3.2 per cent over the next 12 months. This is up from the 2.9 per cent predicted rate polled in the previous quarter, under the Singapore Index of Inflation Expectations by the Singapore Management University (SMU) and DBS Group Research out on Monday (Oct 21). Meanwhile, respondents expect core inflation - price hikes excluding housing and private road transport - to come in at 3.3 per cent for the year ahead, up from their 3.1 per cent forecast in the June poll. The latest poll was conducted in September and led by SMU assistant professor of finance (education) Aurobindo Ghosh. The quarterly online survey interviews around 500 individuals representing a cross-section of Singaporean households. DBS Group Research is a co-sponsor and research partner together with the Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics at SMU. The September poll showed that inflation expectations across all categories have either stayed the same or inched up quarter on quarter. The component indices that saw an increase in predicted inflation rates were transport, healthcare, education, recreation and communications. The survey findings were released on Monday, a week after the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced it would reduce slightly the pace of appreciation for the Singapore dollar in its first easing in three years. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  MAS had said that a modest pick-up in gross domestic product growth in 2020 will likely keep inflationary pressures muted. The central bank narrowed its projection for 2019's headline inflation to 0.5 per cent and expects headline inflation to average 0.5 to 1.5 per cent in 2020. MAS also predicts core inflation will come in at the lower end of the 1 to 2 per cent forecast range for 2019, and average 0.5 to 1.5 per cent in 2020. The marginal uptick in Singaporeans' inflation expectations in September is thus ""a tad surprising"" against the backdrop of monetary easing, economic and political uncertainty, and dimmed growth expectations, SMU's Prof Ghosh said on Monday. There is a natural tendency for survey-based inflation expectations measures to often be biased upwards despite adjustments, he added. This has been widely observed in survey-based methods in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers in the United States and, more recently, in New Zealand and Italy. ""It is therefore premature to read anything major from the latest findings,"" Prof Ghosh noted. Meanwhile, DBS chief economist and managing director of group research Taimur Baig said on Monday that inflation remains low worldwide, with Singapore at the centre of that narrative. ""While such a trend is likely to persist, signs of a short-term bottom in inflation, both actual and expected, have emerged. Food and energy prices are low, but not falling any further,"" Mr Baig added. The results of the DBS-SMU survey are consistent with the around 3 per cent medium-term inflation expectations in Singapore, according to Mr Baig. For the longer horizon, over the next five years, Singaporeans believe overall or headline inflation will rise to 4.1 per cent, up from 3.9 per cent in June. Expectations of core inflation in the five years ahead stayed largely stable at 3.9 per cent, compared with  3.8 per cent in the June poll.

UBS cutting 40 banking jobs in Asia,Oct 21 2019,"HONG KONG () - UBS Group is cutting about 40 jobs in the Asia-Pacific as part of a global push to trim costs and combine its trading units, according to a person familiar with the matter. This comes days after the announcement that Ms Choo Oi Yee, managing director and head of Singapore corporate client solutions, will leave to join Singapore digital securities  start-up iSTOX next January. Last month, Mr Edmund Koh, president of UBS Asia-Pacific, told The Business Times that the wealth manager is actively reviewing certain sectors or geographies in which it has exposure in this region. The staff reductions are roughly split between UBS' markets and investment-banking teams with a majority at the level of vice-president or below, the person said, asking not to be identified because the details are not public. The Asian divisions - led by Hong Kong-based Taichi Takahashi and David Chin - will see smaller cuts than those planned in Europe because UBS sees the region as a growth driver, they said. UBS has embarked on a sweeping overhaul of its investment bank, reshuffling senior management and combining trading operations in changes that may ultimately eliminate hundreds of positions, people with knowledge of the plan said earlier. Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and HSBC Holdings are also cutting staff to rein in costs as the industry deals with difficult trading conditions, sputtering economies and the impact of trade tensions on cross-border deals. Mr Mark Panday, a Hong Kong-based spokesman at UBS, declined to comment. As part of its global restructure, Ms Ros L'Esperance and Mr Javier Oficialdegui are being given charge of the newly named global banking division, which will house public capital markets, private financing and mergers and acquisitions. A combined global markets operation including equities and foreign exchange, rates and credit will be run by Mr Jason Barron and Mr George Athanasopoulos. Mr Greg Peirce is taking over as global head of mergers and acquisitions, the first time that role will be based in Hong Kong, the person said. The Asian staff reductions have already begun, with a fresh round expected later this month, they said. ","{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.906, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': 0.8658}",0.8658
Lebanon PM Hariri agrees to reforms amid nationwide protests over economic crisis,Oct 21 2019,"BEIRUT () - Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri agreed on Sunday (Oct 20) to a package of reforms with government partners to ease an economic crisis that has sparked protests aimed at ousting a ruling elite seen as riddled with corruption and cronyism. Officials told  the agreement was reached as hundreds of thousands of protesters flooded the streets for a fourth day in the biggest show of dissent against the establishment in decades. A sea of people, some waving Lebanese flags, called for revolution in protests that resembled the 2011 Arab Spring revolts that toppled four presidents. Mr Hariri, who is leading a coalition government mired by sectarian and political rivalries, gave his feuding government partners a 72-hour deadline last Friday to agree reforms that could ward off crisis, hinting he may otherwise resign. He accused his rivals of obstructing his reform measures that could unlock US$11 billion (S$15 billion) in Western donor pledges and help avert economic collapse. The reform decisions require a 50 per cent reduction in salaries of current and former presidents, ministers and MPs, plus cuts in benefits to state institutions and officials. It also obliges the central bank and private banks to contribute US$3.3 billion to achieve a ""near zero deficit"" for the 2020 budget. It also includes a plan to privatise the telecommunications sector and an overhaul of the costly and crumbling electricity sector, which poses one of the biggest strains on the country's depleted finances. Government sources said Mr Hariri's Cabinet would meet at midday on Monday at the presidential palace to approve the reform package. The anti-government protests, fuelled by crippling economic conditions and anger at perceived government corruption, have fanned out across the country since last Thursday. Cheerful, buoyant and hopeful their protests would bring change, people of all ages and religions played patriotic songs and danced in the streets, with some forming human chains and chanting for their leaders to be ousted.","{'neg': 0.119, 'neu': 0.802, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': -0.8979}",-0.8979
$120m semiconductor research tie-up signed in largest corporate research partnership with academia in S'pore,Oct 21 2019,"SINGAPORE - Technology that will make driverless cars, home sensors and other devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) more durable and cheaper will be researched and developed in Singapore, with a new tie-up between the Government, semiconductor firm GlobalFoundries and the Nanyang Technological University (NTU).Hariz Baharudin On Monday (Oct 21), GlobalFoundries Singapore, NTU and the National Research Foundation (NRF) announced a $120 million in cash and in kind partnership to conduct research on resistive random access memory (ReRAM) over four years. The three parties did not disclose each individual share for the collaboration, which started last year. ReRAM, which is a step-up from current methods of storing and managing data, will allow IoT devices to be stored in a smaller physical space, have higher performance in reading and writing of data, be more energy efficient and have lower production costs. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat, who is also Chairman of NRF, said the agreement was the largest corporate research partnership with academia to date, and held up the ability for such partnerships to create jobs. He said: ""The Government would like to encourage more companies - not just in semiconductors, but across different industries - to form meaningful partnerships with academia. Such research partnerships help to retain high-value advanced manufacturing as a core pillar of our economy, as we move towards an innovation-driven future. ""This is one way that our investments in research and development can be translated into more good jobs for our people."" Currently a nascent field in technological research, ReRAM builds on the random-access memory (RAM) system that today's automotive systems, portable devices and all other electronics use. A joint release by GlobalFoundries, NRF and NTU said that devices with ReRAM would have faster read-write speeds and consume less power - qualities useful in the application of IoT devices. While the three parties did not disclose the breakdown for the agreement, some of the funding for the research will come from the $19 billion Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 master plan. The ReRAM research and development agreement will bring together around 70 researchers from NTU and GlobalFoundries, including at least 16 postgraduate trainees under the Economic Development Board's Industrial Postgraduate Programme, to develop critical research and development skills through industrial attachments. The university's vice president of research Professor Lam Khin Yong, said: ""Singapore's tripartite model of research partnership between private, public and academic sectors plays an important role in ensuring that research done in the lab will have an eventual commercial application, which help drive the nation's Industry 4.0 transformation. ""It is also very timely for NTU to partner GlobalFoundries Singapore to train new talents in the emerging field of ReRAM and to pioneer this next-generation memory technology for IoT."" Calling the partnership a ""a win for Singapore and our people"", Mr Heng said that Singapore needs a strong supply of talent to support its research and innovation efforts in advanced manufacturing. ""Your partnership strengthens Singapore's position as an innovation-driven economy, and will allow us to continue creating new and exciting career opportunities for our people,"" he said.

""On a ridge, it is noticeably windier, with a constant breeze. There are at least 150 species of plants there currently. Some of the plants are from other places in Singapore, like the nature reserves and offshore islands,"" he said. The ridge-top walk is one of two new features of the Gardens, along with the OCBC Arboretum. The arboretum holds 2,000 trees of over 200 species of dipterocarps, which are forest giants that can grow to more than 80m in height. It is also the first arboretum in South-east Asia to use   to monitor the trees as they grow.

""One of them will be a Forest Discovery Centre, where visitors can learn about different forest habitats through exhibits, workshops and activities on forest ecology,"" he said. The other is a Botanical Art Gallery, where visitors can browse rare books and artworks that have been archived from almost 130 years ago. Mr Wong also launched the first three volumes of the Flora Of Singapore book series. The series, which will have 14 volumes in total, will catalogue the nation's 3,000 plant species, said Dr David Middleton, coordinating director of research and conservation at the Singapore Botanic Gardens. ""The main purpose is to develop a catalogue of all the species of plants we have in Singapore. We have to be able to know what we have and where it occurs, to find out what's very rare or what could be threatened,"" he said.

Since both my parents work and bring in a steady income, money was always at hand, even during the economic downturn in 1998. My family has always been conservative with money. I learnt that before making big purchases, you should always consider whether you really need it and how it would affect you financially down the road. At the same time, you also need to know when to spend and the quality that comes with buying certain brands that are more expensive. Do a quick evaluation before you make a big purchase, think about how you see yourself with what you buy and how it can fit into your current lifestyle. It is always good to have that one item that you aspire to buy.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorses 'uncle' Bernie Sanders in US race,Oct 20 2019,"NEW YORK (AFP) - Firebrand Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders on Saturday (Oct 19) with a massive rally that marked the septuagenarian's return to the campaign trail following a heart attack earlier this month. ""I call him 'tio Bernie',"" Ms Ocasio-Cortez, 30, said at the rally in her Queens, New York constituency that Mr Sanders said drew some 20,000 people. ""Tio"" means ""uncle"" in Spanish, the language of Puerto Rico where Ms Ocasio-Cortez has roots. She is the youngest House of Representatives member and considers herself a ""Democratic socialist"", as does Mr Sanders who has been in Congress since 1991. ""We right now have one of the best Democratic presidential primary fields in a generation, and much of that is thanks to work that Bernie Sanders has done in his entire life,"" Mr Ocasio-Cortez said. The Democratic primary field consists of 19 candidates, 12 of whom took part in a debate on Tuesday. Mr Sanders is running third in polls behind Mr Joe Biden and Ms Elizabeth Warren. Battling to catch up in the polls with Ms Warren, the Sanders campaign is hoping for a boost from the show of support - and also to ward off  . ""I am more than ready, more ready than ever, to carry on with you the epic struggle that we face today,"" Mr Sanders said when he took the stage. ""Put it bluntly: I am back!"" Ms Ocasio-Cortez joined her fellow first-year congresswoman Ilhan Omar, another member of the new Democratic guard, in endorsing Mr Sanders. Both women are members of what they call ""The Squad"", an outspoken, leftist group of four rookie, youthful and racially diverse congresswomen whom the President has accused of hating America. Earlier this year, he told them to ""go back"" to other countries - though they are all US citizens. ""The only reason that I had any hope in launching a long-shot campaign for Congress is because Bernie Sanders proved that you can run a grassroots campaign and win,"" Ms Ocasio-Cortez said in her speech. Mr Sanders, 78, is known for consistently refusing political financing from corporations. ""When I was a waitress, and when it was time for me to graduate college with student debt, Bernie Sanders was one of the only ones that said no person should be graduating with life-crushing debt,"" Ms Ocasio-Cortez said in an impassioned speech. Yet some of Mr Sanders's supporters acknowledged that his heart attack  . ""I know that the Warren campaign at least would provide an alternative, even while I don't think she represents all of the values that I have,"" Mr Romeo Lemba, a 28-year-old engineer in the solar panel industry, told AFP. The support from the two lawmakers comes as Mr Sanders tries to woo younger and more racially diverse backers. He's won the endorsement of rap artist Cardi B, who is from the Bronx, another New York borough that Ms Ocasio-Cortez's congressional district partially comprises. Ms Omar, 38, the first black Muslim woman elected to Congress, said earlier this week in her endorsement of the Jewish Sanders that ""Bernie is leading a working-class movement to defeat Donald Trump that transcends generation, ethnicity and geography"".

Trump abandons plan to host 2020 G-7 meeting at his Florida golf resort,Oct 20 2019,"WASHINGTON () - US President Donald Trump abandoned plans late on Saturday (Oct 19) to host next year's Group of Seven summit at his Florida golf resort, after Democrats and others had decried the selection as evidence of the President misusing his office for personal gain. In a series of tweets, Mr Trump said he would drop the plan announced on Thursday by White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to host the meeting at Trump National Doral golf resort near Miami from June 10 to 12. Mr Trump cited what he termed ""Crazed and Irrational Hostility"" from Democrats and the news media in explaining the reversal. ""We will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately,"" he wrote. The Republican President faces criticism and a number of congressional investigations over his finances and potential conflicts of interest stemming from his real estate business, which he still owns, and an impeachment inquiry into accusations that he pursued political interests in his dealings with Ukraine. On Saturday, Mr Trump sought to emphasise what he said were the site's positive features for hosting a large gathering. ""I thought I was doing something very good for our Country,"" he wrote on Twitter. The US Constitution's emoluments clause prohibits government officials from receiving salaries, fees or profits from foreign and domestic governments without congressional approval. Democrats have said they would investigate Mr Trump's plan to host the G-7 at his property after he floated the idea in August. In a statement on Thursday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler called the announcement ""among the most brazen examples yet of the President's corruption"". Mr Nadler said the committee would continue investigating ""regarding these matters"".

They can also enjoy plants from habitats found in the tropical hills of South-east Asia as they hike along the Mingxin Foundation Rambler's Ridge, which opened on Saturday (Oct 19). The ridge is part of the Gallop Extension, situated just beyond the western boundary of  . The 8ha extension is about the size of 11 football fields and brings the garden's total area to 82ha. The Gallop Extension is located in Gallop Road. Visitors can access it via a 200m bridge extending across Tyersall Avenue from the Learning Forest, starting next year. The plan was first mooted four years ago, said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong, who was the guest of honour at the launch. ""Some of you may know that when the Gardens was established 160 years ago, it had only 22 hectares of space. With the plans  , today it will be almost four times the size, at 82 hectares,"" said Mr Wong. He encouraged visitors to attempt the ridge-top hike, if they are ""feeling very adventurous"".

Some of the plants here are from other places in Singapore, like the nature reserves and offshore islands,"" he explained. The ridge-top walk is one of two new features of the garden, along with the OCBC Arboretum. The arboretum holds 2,000 trees of over 200 species of dipterocarps, which are forest giants that can grow to more than 80m.

Hong Kong moves to shore up investor confidence,Oct 21 2019,"The city's embattled government has tried to shore up business confidence as companies, particularly those from the mainland, reel from 20 consecutive weekends of mostly violent demonstrations.Claire Huang Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK), the government body tasked to attract and retain foreign direct investments, yesterday released two surveys showing that the city continued to attract and retain leading overseas and mainland companies, as well as global entrepreneurs. There were 9,040 businesses in Hong Kong this year with parent companies overseas and on the mainland, up 9.9 per cent from 2017, said the joint survey by InvestHK and the Census and Statistics Department. The companies employed 493,000 people, an all-time high, and up 11.3 per cent from 2017. Of these businesses, 1,541 had regional headquarters in Hong Kong, a figure that was up 9.1 per cent. Many are from the mainland, followed by Japan, the United States, Britain and Singapore, among others. A separate survey by InvestHK found that the number of start-ups operating in major public and private co-work spaces and incubators in Hong Kong jumped 42.8 per cent to 3,184 this year, from 2017. Of the founders, 34 per cent were from outside Hong Kong, with the bulk from the US, the mainland and Britain. Hong Kong's simple tax system, low tax rate, free flow of information and geographical location were among the top reasons cited for doing business in the city. The positive figures notwithstanding, opinion remains divided on what impact the continuing unrest will have on businesses. Mr Stephen Phillips, director-general of investment promotion, noted that it has put a dampener on investment sentiments, and said that InvestHK would devote more efforts to carrying out promotional work to rebuild investors' confidence. Executive director Terence Chong of the Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong remains confident, even though he expects the city may experience a sharp reduction in the number of company registrations in six months. ""I don't worry about the current situation at all because you have demonstrations everywhere, even in New York, London, and this is not going to last forever, so once the social unrest is gone, Hong Kong will return to the normal situation."" Dr Chong said that it was easier for mainland companies to come to Hong Kong, which has no capital controls. ""There is no other city for them to choose,"" said Dr Chong. But managing director of Shanghai-based Kaiyuan Capital Brock Silvers said that even if the absolute number of offshore companies and start-ups in Hong Kong rose, ""a more relevant metric might be the measure of opportunity lost, and many companies have been reducing their footprint or forgoing investment rather than fully exiting"". Financial Secretary Paul Chan, in a blog post on Sunday, disclosed that the government was now studying the possibility of rolling out a third round of relief measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises. Mr Chan had said previously that the clashes between radical protesters and riot police in recent months had weighed down the retail and tourism industry, with many shuttering their businesses or laying off workers. He added that about 100 restaurants had closed, and about 2,000 people were affected in the catering business. A number of mega local events, such as the Hong Kong Wine and Dine Festival, the Hong Kong Cyclothon, the Hong Kong Cross Harbour Race and a few sporting events, have been cancelled due to security concerns. Mr Silvers said Hong Kong was feeling the dual pressure of a slowing Chinese economy and an unsettled local atmosphere, ""reflected in its muddling financial markets"".","{'neg': 0.041, 'neu': 0.87, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': 0.979}",0.979
"Pain from US trade wars a key topic at IMF, World Bank meet",Oct 20 2019,"WASHINGTON • The collateral damage of the United States' trade wars is being felt from the fjords of Iceland to the auto factories of Japan. Central bank governors and finance ministers traded grim tales of suffering economies at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank autumn meetings in Washington last week. Some also noted how far US policy has shifted from the 1940s, when Washington co-founded the IMF. At that time, ""the world economy had been hammered for over a decade by high tariff barriers, depression and war"", prompting then-US Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau to champion a global economic system, World Bank president David Malpass told attendees at a session last week. The US message then, Mr Malpass said, was: ""First, there's no limit to prosperity. Second, broadly shared prosperity benefits everyone."" As the IMF's gathering of 189 member nations drew to a close, the unintended negative impacts of the trade wars were becoming clear, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said. ""Everybody loses."" The US, the world's largest importer, started a bitter tariff war with China, the world's largest exporter, 15 months ago. And President Donald Trump is in the midst of renegotiating, and sometimes upending, trade ties with many of the US' top trading partners. The fallout will slow global growth this year to 3 per cent, the slowest pace in a decade, the IMF said in its latest estimate. The damage is being particularly felt in European countries which ""rely on exports and are open to trade"". Countries that do not rely on exports are hit too. Iceland built foreign currency reserves on the back of an increase in visitors, but those are dropping. Japan's Cabinet Office has downgraded its assessment of factory output for October. The softness in production was largely due to car exports to the US turning weaker, a government official said. The trade tensions are helping to spur a push among African nations to create a more self-reliant continent. ""We must take it upon ourselves to grow trade among ourselves,"" said a Kenyan official. Peru cut its 2019 economic growth estimate to 3 per cent in August, from 4.2 per cent. Mexico is edging closer to a recession that may be more difficult to reverse than during the last downturn over a decade ago. This pain is not being shared equally. The US remains the least exposed of the world's 20 largest economies to a drop in exports in part because of its massive domestic consumer spending base. The damage is being particularly felt in European countries which ""rely on exports and are open to trade"", the European Union's economic and financial affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici said. More than 40 per cent of Germany's GDP was derived from exports last year, the most of any major global economy. Uncertainty in the business community is widespread, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told reporters. German trade group BGA recently revised down its growth forecast for the country's exports this year to just 0.5 per cent, from 1.5 per cent. As a result, many companies are scaling back their investment plans, something that will have repercussions for years to come. Mr Scholz said concerns over Britain's impending departure from the EU and the bloc's trade dispute with the US were clearly dampening global economic growth. ""The most important problem remains those factors that we cannot measure - specifically the reluctance to invest,"" Mr Scholz said. The pain is also being felt in countries that do not rely on exports, such as Iceland, which became the first developed economy to seek aid from the IMF after a 2008 banking collapse. Since then, it has rebuilt its economy in what has been called a miraculous recovery. Now, that is threatened. Iceland, with a population of about 300,000, built foreign currency reserves on the back of the increase in visitors, governor of Iceland's central bank Asgeir Jonsson said, but those are dropping too. Trade links between countries have led to a more peaceful world in recent decades, but recent experience shows ""you can never take global trade for granted"", he said. Last Friday, Japan's Cabinet Office, which helps coordinate government policy, downgraded its assessment of factory output for October. The softness in production was largely due to car exports to the US turning weaker, after growing steadily until the spring, a government official said. The US has not been totally spared the impact of the trade wars. American farmers have been particularly hurt by Chinese tariffs on US agricultural products, prompting the Trump administration to give billions in aid to the farm belt. Washington's imposition of steel and aluminium tariffs, and uncertainty about passage of a new North American free trade deal - the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement - have also stalled local economic development. The trade tensions are helping to spur a push among African nations to create a more self-reliant continent. ""We must take it upon ourselves to grow trade among ourselves,"" said Kenya's Acting Cabinet Secretary for Treasury Ukur Yatani Kanacho. Senegal's Finance Minister Abdoulaye Daouda Diallo told reporters the US-China trade tensions would affect African nations in the energy sector and cut funds available on financial markets. The dispute underscored the importance of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, he said. Other emerging markets are also coming under pressure. ""Ukrainian exporters faced worsened conditions in global commodity markets,"" which drove down steel prices, said Ms Kateryna Rozhkova, the deputy governor of the country's central bank.

Wirecard hires KPMG for independent audit after latest FT allegations,Oct 21 2019,"BERLIN (REUTERS) - German payments company Wirecard has hired KPMG to conduct an independent audit to  (FT) that its finance team had sought to inflate reported sales and profits, it said on Monday (Oct 21). The company, promoted to the DAX blue-chip index last year, has been the target of a series of investigative reports by FT reporter Dan McCrum, with the latest, on Oct 15, knocking more than 20 per cent off its share price. It has rejected the newspaper's latest allegations, based on internal spreadsheets and correspondence, that Wirecard's senior finance team had sought to inflate reported sales and profits at its businesses in Dubai and Ireland. The FT's reporting has however led to calls on Wirecard from investors and corporate governance advocates to hire an outside auditor both to clear up the matter and to demonstrate that it meets the governance standards of a top-tier public company. ""We have complete confidence in the audit procedures performed to date and their results. We assume this renewed independent review will lead to a final end to all further speculation,"" Wulf Matthias, chairman of Wirecard AG's supervisory board, said in a statement. Wirecard shares rose by 3.5 per cent in pre-market trading in Frankfurt. The audit will begin immediately, Wirecard said, adding that KPMG would report to the company's supervisory board and have unrestricted access to information at all levels of the group. Thomas Eichelmann, chairman of the audit committee of Wirecard's supervisory board and a former chief financial officer of Deutsche Boerse, will support the audit on behalf of Wirecard. Wirecard has long been a favourite target of short sellers, or speculators who seek to profit from the airing of negative information that drives down a company's share price. It has accused the FT and reporter McCrum of colluding with short sellers, as well as suing the newspaper. FT editor Lionel Barber has said  found no evidence to support those claims. In-house auditor EY signed off on Wirecard's 2018 accounts in April after an earlier FT story alleged fraud and false accounting at the company's Singapore office. An investigation by an outside law firm found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by head office,  , Wirecard said at the time. Separately, German prosecutors are investigating a group of individuals on suspicion of manipulating Wirecard stock, acting on evidence provided by financial market regulator Bafin.

Ethiopian human rights boss battles scant resources,Nov 17 2019," (This Nov 17 story corrects paragraph 2 to show Bekele did not work for HRW at time of appointment to current post.) By Giulia Paravicini ADDIS ABABA () - When Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed appointed a former political prisoner in July as head of the state-funded human rights commission, supporters hailed it as a sign the country might finally tackle abuses by security forces and move to break a cycle of bloody ethnic feuds. Daniel Bekele had high ranking positions at watchdogs Human Rights Watch and Amnesty before coming home to take up the post. Now reality has hit. He has one investigator for every million Ethiopians, and low salaries make it impossible to attract and retain talent, he told  in an interview on Friday. His own salary after tax is equivalent to $270 per month, common for civil servants. Parliament, which he reports to, approves the commission's budget, equivalent to $3 million annually, but the finance ministry approves all spending, curbing the commission's autonomy.  Even if funds were adequate, he said, bureaucracy prevents the quick deployment of researchers to investigate ethnic clashes around the country that have killed hundreds of people in the past few months alone.  The commission was established 15 years ago but was largely ineffective. Security forces committed widespread abuses against civilians but the commission rarely documented them. After three years of protests, the ruling coalition bowed to pressure and appointed Abiy in April 2018 to drive reforms. His peacemaking efforts with longtime foe and neighbor Eritrea won him the Nobel Peace Prize last month. He has appointed former dissidents like Bekele to senior roles in the justice sector, raising hopes that abuses will not go unpunished. Ethiopia must push harder if it wants to break the cycle of violence, Bekele said. “It is equally important to be as strong on pressing accountability for abuses,” he said. “A lack of accountability (today) is simply continuing a cycle of abuse and impunity.” The commission receives hundreds of complaints monthly. Bekele's desk is piled with letters whose complaints range from domestic violence to mass killings. Only a small percentage are investigated due to scarce resources, he said. Also on the desk is a photograph of his wife and three children, who stayed behind in New York.     Bekele said he is committed to his new role despite the challenges. “It is worth it because we are in a new political chapter, with a new opening and a new opportunity which is very promising,” he said. Abiy has spearheaded reforms that included unbanning political parties, releasing political prisoners and welcoming home exiled militant groups. But the new freedoms have also meant long-repressed tensions have surged between the country's many ethnic groups. The commission is investigating clashes last month in Oromiya region that resulted in more than 80 deaths, displacement and property destruction. The federal army has been deployed to quell violence in several parts of the country and many fear more bloodshed ahead of the general elections due in May 2020. The Sidama ethnic group is due to vote on Wednesday in a referendum on self-determination, a demand of at least eight other ethnic groups.  Amnesty International's Ethiopia researcher, Fisseha Tekle, said the commission needs radical reforms to be effective. Simply having a dedicated leader is no substitute for institutional reform, he said. “The commission is facing serious challenges due to the ever-increasing human rights crisis in (Ethiopia),” he said. “It is not well prepared.” ","{'neg': 0.158, 'neu': 0.719, 'pos': 0.123, 'compound': -0.9832}",-0.9832
UK's Johnson drops corporate tax cut plan in bid to woo voters,Nov 18 2019,"LONDON () - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday he was  putting on hold further cuts in corporation tax and told voters he would use the money for spending on health and other priorities. His comments addressed a central issue in a Dec. 12 election as Johnson has been under pressure to show how he would pay for a plan to reverse cuts to many public services over the past decade and boost infrastructure investment. “We are postponing further cuts in corporation tax,” Johnson told business leaders at a conference organized by the Confederation of British Industry, an employers' group. “This saves 6 billion pounds ($7.8 billion) that we can put into the priorities of the British people, including the NHS (National Health Service).”  Britain's main corporation tax is among the lowest among the world's industrialized economies but the government had been due to cut it to 17% next year from 19% now.  In September, finance minister Sajid Javid announced Britain's biggest increase in day-to-day spending in 15 years in what was widely seen as an attempt to counter the spending promises of the left-wing opposition Labour Party. Johnson, who called the election to try to secure a majority in parliament that would back his plan for Britain's departure from the European Union, said on Monday he would keep Javid as his finance minister if their Conservatives win the election. British media have reported tensions between the teams of the two most powerful men in the government.   The postponed corporation tax cuts received a cautious welcome from the CBI's director-general. “Postponing further cuts to corporation tax to invest in public services could work for the country if it is backed by further efforts to the costs of doing business and promote growth,” Carolyn Fairbairn said in a statement. Labour wants to raise the corporation tax rate and income taxes for top earners to help fund its own, bigger spending plans. “Taxation is going to change under Labour. We've made no secret of that. We've been very, very clear that the richest 5% will pay more,” Corbyn told the CBI after Johnson spoke. “And over the lifetime of the government, we will increase corporation tax to no higher than the 2010 levels.” In 2010, the corporation tax rate stood at 28%. Before the 2017 election, Labour said it would raise the rate to 26%. With the prospect of widespread infrastructure nationalization under Labour, and an abrupt Brexit possible under Johnson's Conservatives, many business leaders say they face unprecedented levels of uncertainty. “I believe we are facing a danger that could get in the way of a bright future, and it takes the form of extreme ideology. And we see it on both sides of the political divide,” the CBI's Fairbairn said.      ","{'neg': 0.078, 'neu': 0.811, 'pos': 0.111, 'compound': 0.9776}",0.9776
"Merkel, Scholz push back against demands for higher public spending",Nov 18 2019,"BERLIN () - Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz on Monday brushed aside a rare joint demand from German businesses and unions that they “wake up” the stagnant economy by ditching the balanced budget policy and funding infrastructure with debt. The call by the BDI, Germany's most influential business lobby group, and the DGB umbrella union shows how much public debate has shifted in a country long obsessed with its “black zero” policy of no net new borrowing. With the economy barely growing and Berlin's borrowing costs at record lows, Merkel and Scholz are facing growing pressure at home and abroad to drop their self-imposed balanced budget pledge, which limits the fiscal room to hike public spending. BDI President Dieter Kempf and DGB head Reiner Hoffmann said in their joint statement that Berlin should not only bury the budget policy, but also consider changes to the constitutionally enshrined debt brake. “Germany must wake up from its sleeping phase,” Kempf told reporters in Berlin. “This is not primarily about fighting symptoms of a recession, but rather tackling the more deeply rooted causes of weak growth,” Kempf said.  The government had a duty to improve Germany as a business location and secure long-term prosperity, he said. But Merkel and Scholz both insisted during a news conference following the weekly cabinet meeting that the government had already increased public investment to record levels so there was no need to question the debt ban as a guiding principle. “With this budget policy, we can also generate growth,” Merkel said after data showed last week that Europe's largest economy grew a meager 0.1% in the third quarter and even shrank by 0.2% in the previous three months. Scholz said he viewed the comments by the BDI and DGB as supporting the government's expansionary fiscal policy. Kempf said Berlin should increase public investment in digital and transportation infrastructure by half a percentage point of economic output, roughly 17 billion euros. This would be on top of the 43 billion euros earmarked in the federal budget for public investments in 2020. “We can no longer afford to put the prosperity of future generations at risk with such an outdated infrastructure and underfunded education system,” DGB head Hoffmann added, saying that more public investment would also strengthen social cohesion and promote equal living conditions across the country. Germany's state-owned development bank KfW has estimated that municipalities across the country have unmet public investment needs of about 138 billion euros. Boosting German investment would also be positive for the broader euro zone. The new president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, has singled out Germany as a country that could deploy its budget surpluses to help growth in the bloc. Germany's debt brake allows a federal budget deficit of up to 0.35% of gross domestic product, giving Berlin only limited scope to increase new debt. Officials are considering the creation of independent public investment agencies which could take on debt without falling foul of the strict national spending rules, three people familiar with the matter told  in September.

Czech government approves digital tax aimed at internet giants,Nov 18 2019,"PRAGUE () - The Czech government approved a 7% digital tax proposal on Monday aimed at boosting state coffers by taxing advertising by global internet giants like Google and Facebook, the Finance Ministry said. The proposed tax, which still must make it past lawmakers in parliament, covers revenue gained from targeted advertising, providing digital market places, and user data sales.  It will be aimed at services provided to Czech users.  It would apply to companies with global revenue over 750 million euros ($826.50 million) annually, 100 million crown ($4.32 million) turnover in the Czech market and a reach exceeding 200,000 user accounts. The Finance Ministry said it estimated the tax, which it said would be temporary until a global deal could be reached, will raise 2.1 billion crowns next year if it takes effect for June, and about 5 billion annually in following years. The Czech Republic has followed some other countries in Europe with the digital tax after the European Union (EU) failed to reach a bloc-wide agreement last year.

Corbyn effect? British utility debt boosted by nationalization bet,Nov 18 2019,"LONDON () - British utilities are becoming increasingly popular with bond investors who believe their debt may benefit if a Labour government comes to power in December's general election and takes them into public ownership.     Labour's finance spokesman John McDonnell last week detailed the party's plans to nationalize parts of BT () to provide free broadband for all if it wins the election.  Previously, Britain's main opposition party has spoken about plans to nationalize privately-owned, and in many cases publicly listed, energy, water and rail companies should they come to power. Most opinion polls show the ruling Conservative Party with a clear lead ahead of the Dec. 12 poll, suggesting a left-wing government under Jeremy Corbyn is unlikely.  However, the Labour Party surpassed expectations at the previous election in 2017 and a Corbyn victory would be viewed as an unfavorable outcome by many in the financial markets community. But some corporate bond investors are more sanguine. “We believe that it would be a quite favorable outcome for British utilities on the debt side as the operating companies of these utilities will become more closely aligned with the UK government,” said one portfolio manager who works for a British fund manager. As a result, he said the fund he works for has added British utilities to their bond portfolios. Utilities and telecoms collectively make up more than a third of the 502 billion pounds ($651 billion) UK corporate bond market, according to Refinitiv data. Of this, the energy and power sector makes up about 22.8% while telecoms makes up another 15.7%.  “Labour have stated they want to pursue a model similar to TfL (Transport for London), which has a very close relationship with the UK government and enjoys a very high credit rating as a result,” the investor added.   TfL, which runs London's underground and bus network, enjoys a credit rating of AA- from ratings agencies S&P Global and Fitch, just a notch below the UK government.  Recent bond issuance by British utilities ranging from National Grid Electricity Transmission to Scottish Power UK — through its operating company SP Transmission — have all been met with strong demand. SP Transmission's 350 million pound, 12-year bond issued early this month, for example, received enough demand to cover the deal nearly five times over.  A source close to that transaction said: “I think the market gave us a really easy time, there were no questions over nationalization... I was actually astonished.”  Investors say the rationale is clear.  “Labour publications suggest that bondholders at the regulated ringfenced level could be ‘honored in full' and refinanced over a period of time so that the costs of debt are reduced,” said Sharon Vieten, a credit analyst at fund manager Columbia Threadneedle, in a July note.  She said the yield premium that investors demand to hold utility bonds over benchmark UK government debt, known as gilts,  could fall. “We estimate that at the 25-year maturity point, this tightening could reach a scale of 20-45 basis points (of yield) on UK gilts, compared to the current level of 140-160 basis points,” Vieten wrote.  There are also some signs of divergence within the structure of company debt that show investors are playing a nationalization trade.  As Labour has said it will nationalize utilities at the operating company level, investors have started favoring operating company debt rather than holding company debt.  Energy firm SSE's () February 2037 bond GB024417123=, issued through its Southern Electricity Power Distribution plc operating company, is now far outperforming an August 2038 bond GB038318772= issued through the holding company, by almost 30 basis points on yield. Yields move inversely to prices.  For a graphic on SSE opco vs holdco debt, bond yields, click  One caveat is nationalization would require additional borrowing and could push gilt yields higher, hurting the credit rating of the UK government and, by extension, British utility debt.  Ratings agency Fitch warned last week that the election pledges ahead of the vote heighten the United Kingdom's fiscal risks.  But the portfolio manager said the nationalization plans wouldn't involve enough borrowing to put the ‘Double A' UK rating at risk, and wouldn't deter him from investing in British utilities.

"Lebanon is a sinking ship, parliament speaker warns",Nov 18 2019,"BEIRUT () - The speaker of parliament on Monday described Lebanon as a sinking ship at risk going under completely, underlining the depth of crisis in a country hamstrung by political deadlock and facing the worst economic strains since the 1975-90 civil war. Banks, which have been seeking to prevent capital flight, were set to reopen on Tuesday as staff ended a one-week strike over security concerns posed by clients demanding their cash and protests at branches. Struggling with a massive public debt and economic stagnation, Lebanon has sunk deeper into trouble since protests erupted against its ruling elite a month ago, leading Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri to quit on Oct. 29. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri told his visitors Lebanon was like a ship that was “sinking little by little”, the newspaper al-Joumhuria reported.  “If we don't take the necessary steps, it will sink entirely,” he said. An-Nahar newspaper quoted him as likening Lebanon to the Titanic. Berri, an ally of the powerful Shi'ite group Hezbollah, also said that efforts to form a new government were “completely frozen” and awaiting developments at any moment, al-Joumhuria reported. Efforts to form a new government, needed to enact urgent reforms, hit a setback at the weekend when former finance minister Mohammad Safadi withdrew his candidacy for the post of prime minister, drawing bitter recriminations. Safadi had emerged as a candidate after Hariri, who is aligned with Western and Gulf Arab states, had been unable to agree with the Iran-backed Hezbollah and its allies on the type of government that should replace the outgoing cabinet. Hariri had said that he would only return as prime minister of a cabinet of specialist ministers capable of securing international aid and saving Lebanon from crisis.  Hezbollah, which is heavily armed and listed as a terrorist group by the United States, and its allies have insisted that the government include politicians. Hezbollah's deputy leader, in comments to Iranian media, said “political understandings” would take place between “the parties and even with leaders of the protest movement” to form a new government, without giving further details. Sheikh Naim Kassem also said the new government's agenda would help to calm down the streets.     Both Hezbollah and Berri have said their preference is for Hariri to return again as prime minister - a post reserved for a Sunni Muslim in Lebanon's power-sharing system. The nationwide protests have been fueled by the mismanagement and perceived corruption of the ruling elite. Lebanon's economic problems have been compounded by a slowdown of capital inflows, leading to a scarcity of U.S. dollars and spawning a hard currency black market. Dollars were being offered at 1,820 pounds, around Friday's level, dealers said, but still some 20% weaker than the official rate of 1,507.5 pounds. On Sunday, banks, which have mostly been closed since the protests began, announced temporary measures including a weekly cap of $1,000 on cash withdrawals and restricting transfers abroad to cover urgent personal spending only. A union representing bank staff said banks would be operating as normal on Tuesday after a decision to end the strike. It cited an interior ministry security plan and the newly declared measures announced by the banking association as the reason for the decision to go back to work. “Tomorrow the banking sector will no longer be on strike. Tomorrow is a normal working day in all banks and all branches,” George al-Haj, President of the Federation of Syndicates of Bank Employees, said.

MTN deal with Cell C knocks shares in South Africa's Telkom,Nov 18 2019,"JOHANNESBURG () - South Africa's MTN Group () has signed an expanded roaming agreement with the country's third-biggest carrier Cell C, pushing shares in its owner up while dragging those of rival Telkom () down.  The deal puts a dampener on Telkom's proposed takeover of Cell C, which is majority owned by Blue Label Telecoms () and is struggling under the weight of hefty debts. The buyout bid was announced on Friday.  It will see an existing agreement between MTN and Cell C, which gives the struggling carrier access to MTN's network in some areas of the country, expanded nationwide.  The MTN agreement strengthens Cell C's position after months of efforts to sort out its finances and questions over how it will survive. Blue Label, its owner, has written its holding in the carrier down to zero.         Cell C CEO Douglas Craigie Stevenson said in a statement the MTN agreement will help Cell C to manage its network capacity requirements in a more cost-effective manner. The deal spares Cell C having to spend large sums to ensure national coverage. “The roaming agreement is transformative for Cell C,” Stevenson said.  Telkom shares were down 3.36% by 1302 GMT, recovering some ground after losing more than 5% following the news. Meanwhile Blue Label shares were up 6.27% and MTN shares were down 0.48% In a statement, Telkom said it expects the roaming agreement and its terms will have been considered in the context of Cell C's discussions with Telkom.  For MTN, meanwhile, the deal means the opportunity to earn more revenue from Cell C, which helped push its enterprise and wholesale revenue up 8.4% to 13.4 billion rand in the 2018 financial year.  In the six months to June 30, however, MTN opted not to recognize revenue amounting to 393 million rand from the Cell C deal due to the company's financial problems.  “This [the agreement] is aligned to MTN's strategy to further develop the group's wholesale business and will allow both MTN and Cell C to harness greater efficiencies... while supporting a more sustainable and competitive industry,” MTN said in its statement.

UPDATE 2-Israel's Bezeq Telecom hopes to start fibre rollout soon as profits fall,Nov 18 2019,"* Larger-than-expected fall in third-quarter profit * Hoping for new regulations in weeks or months * Reiterates on track for a 1.1 bln shekel loss in 2019 (Adds CEO comment) By Steven Scheer and Tova Cohen TEL AVIV, Nov 18 () - Bezeq Israel Telecom said on Monday it hoped it could soon start deploying its fibre optic network after the telecoms regulator opened the door to a less comprehensive service than it had previously demanded. Bezeq, the dominant telecoms group in Israel, has been locked in a battle with the regulator over rolling out its fibre network, with Bezeq unwilling to meet demands it provide it for 100% of the country, saying that was not economically viable. This month the ministry said it was willing to allow Bezeq to choose where to roll out its network - up to 10 times faster than current speeds to allow for more streaming of entertainment and more connected appliances - which would eventually give the company a boost in revenue and profit. Chief Executive David Mizrahi said Bezeq's network already covered 60% of the country with fibre to buildings and it would take a few years to connect those households. “Hopefully in the next few weeks or months the ministry will form new regulations that will maybe allow us to start deploying the service but only on an economic basis,” he told  after issuing the company's third-quarter earnings. Rivals Cellcom and Partner Communications have started to deploy their own fibre networks although as the largest telecoms group, Bezeq will likely have a very high market share. Given the cost of connecting isolated homes to the new networks, companies have long found more densely populated cities more cost effective to tackle. Barclays analyst Tavy Rosner said that although Bezeq was losing market share in fixed line, that will likely change once Bezeq and the regulator reach a final agreement on fibre. Bezeq, which is in the midst of a change in ownership, reported a quarterly profit of 191 million shekels ($55 million), down from 234 million a year earlier and slightly short of the 198 million forecast by analysts. Bezeq attributed the decline mainly to higher financing expenses. Revenue fell 2.3% to 2.25 billion shekels, slightly above the 2.23 billion expected by analysts. Bezeq owns mobile phone operator Pelephone, satellite TV firm YES and internet service provider Bezeq International. “Bezeq is in the midst of a major restructuring with several parallel early retirement plans and cost-cutting measures,” said Rosner said. “These are starting to pay off, as demonstrated by the 4% decrease in salaries.” Last week the Communications Ministry approved the sale of a controlling share in Bezeq to the foreign private investor group Searchlight Capital Partners. The company reiterated it was on track for a 1.1 billion shekel loss in 2019 after two major write-downs in its business units this year.

"UK lawmaker blames HSBC, Stanchart, Baroda in South Africa corruption",Nov 18 2019,"JOHANNESBURG () - Corruption under South Africa's former president Jacob Zuma was enabled by international banks, companies and governments which should now seek to recover the loot they helped to launder, British lawmaker Peter Hain told an inquiry on Monday. HSBC, Standard Chartered and India's Bank of Baroda as well as their senior directors were “directly culpable” in the looting of South Africa's treasury under Zuma, Hain said in his submission to the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture. Hain was invited to give evidence because he had already named several corporates he was investigating under parliamentary privilege in 2017 as complicit in state capture.  HSBC said it fully supported the commission's inquiry, while Standard Chartered said there was no evidence linking it to the Guptas directly. Bank of Baroda did not respond to a request for comment. “They're all up to their neck in this,” he told the inquiry at his appearance.  “They continued because of course the corporates concerned, including the banks, were making money out of it...The Guptas could not have amassed this illicit wealth without the corporates and the banks ... being their little helpers.” Zuma, who was removed as president last year over corruption allegations, is facing a judicial inquiry. He has agreed to cooperate but has dismissed the probe as prejudiced.  Part of its brief is to investigate accusations that the Guptas - prominent businessmen brothers Atul, Ajay and Rajesh — influenced Zuma over political appointments and state contracts. Hain, a labour lord and former anti-Apartheid activist, called on the banks, global corporates and foreign governments to cooperate better so all those involved are brought to justice.  In his submission he said a number of international banks helped the Guptas cloak the source of their funds - by allowing them to open and maintain bank accounts, even after allegations of their involvement in corruption became public, and also by allowing them to transfer illicit funds into these accounts. “The warning signs were there and they did very little about it,” he said of the banks, adding that when he had tried to question the banks after he had named them in parliament as complicity he “found a great reluctance, citing ... client confidentiality, which is the excuse they hide behind.... The international banks, HSBC, Standard Chartered and Bank of Baroda are hiding behind this principle to conceal their complicity.”   The role of global finance in facilitating corruption, fraud and money laundering has come under increasing scrutiny over the past decade, but the fight against financial crime is mostly dealt with by national authorities who often fail to cooperate effectively. Among his recommendations are to improve transparency around the beneficial owners of companies. He also proposes better programmes for auditing the due diligence conducted by banks to ensure that they are complying with anti-money laundering laws, and stiffer penalties for individuals and organisations that fail to do so. An HSBC spokeswoman said the bank will continue to investigate any potential links to the Guptas or Gupta-related individuals and companies should new information come to light. “This is no easy task given the lengths to which the Guptas have gone to disguise their activity,” she said. A spokesman for Standard Chartered said: “We have found no evidence that we banked the Guptas directly, but we closed all accounts we identified as linked to their business interests by early 2014.” It declined to comment further on the grounds of client confidentiality. The Guptas also deny the accusations and say they have been victims of a political attack. They have since closed their South African operations in mining, media and technology. Hain's report said that they currently reside in Dubai, and call on the Dubai authorities to extradite them to South Africa to face questioning over the allegations.

"Euronext, SIX Group square up for battle for Madrid bourse",Nov 18 2019,"PARIS/ZURICH () - Pan-European stock market operator Euronext () and Switzerland's SIX sparked a bidding war for Spain's Bolsas y Mercados Espanoles (BME) () on Monday, with both trying to snap up one of Europe's last standalone stock exchanges. SIX made a friendly all-cash offer for the Spanish bourse, whose shares jumped by more than a third in early trading, while  Euronext said it was in talks with BME with a view to a potential bid, without saying how much it was prepared to pay.      With European sector leaders Deutsche Boerse () and London Stock Exchange (LSE) () effectively too big to consolidate without raising serious competition concerns, mergers are focused on smaller players, with Euronext having already scooped up the Dublin and Oslo exchanges.     SIX has offered BME 34 euros per share, implying a total equity value of 2.843 billion euros ($3.13 billion), a hefty 34% premium over BME's market capitalization of just over 2 billion euros before the offer was announced. The Swiss exchange's proposed deal is “very much” about growing the revenues of both businesses, SIX Chief Executive Jos Dijsselhof told reporters on Monday, adding that BME are “happy with the commitments made by SIX thus far”. “They have stated we are offering a fair price. It is our expectation we will retain the listing,” Dijsselhof said, adding that it was too early to talk about raising the offer.     Shares of BME, among the smallest of Europe's exchanges, were up 37% at 34.7 euros by 1152 GMT. It said SIX's offer “reasonably” reflected its current value.  Euronext, which has a market cap of around 5 billion euros, had denied earlier this month that it was bidding for BME.  BME board members and shareholders must now decide whether to wait for any formal Euronext offer before deciding on the Swiss bid.    Euronext said last month it has several hundreds of millions of euros for acquisitions and could tap markets to boost its war chest to over two billion euros. Taking over BME would not dramatically alter the overall European exchange landscape, but would help to buttress SIX or Euronext.     Euronext, whose shares rose 1.4% to 72.85 euros on Monday, is a minnow compared to LSE and Deutsche Boerse, which have market capitalizations of 24 billion pounds ($31.11 billion) and 26 billion euros, respectively. But it has gradually built up its presence and now operates exchanges in Norway, Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, France and Ireland, with Spain an obvious gap. SIX is focused on Switzerland and buying BME would give it a base inside the European Union and put the combined group in third place behind LSE and Deutsche Boerse in terms of revenues and profit, Citi said. An EU base would be a boost to Switzerland after Brussels blocked EU-based investors from trading on Swiss exchanges from July this year as a row escalated over a stalled bilateral treaty. SIX said the deal would have no bearing on Bern's broader political discussion with Brussels, a row which has also meant that Swiss shares can only be bought and sold via Switzerland's two exchanges. Analysts at Citi said buying BME would enable the Swiss bourse to offer clearing and settlement of shares inside the EU by using the Spanish bourse's infrastructure. SIX said its proposed purchase would be financed through a combination of existing cash resources and access to capital markets. Brokers in Madrid said that as a standalone exchange, BME had been diversifying revenues away from a shrinking volume of share trading.  Spain would likely need reassurances that local jobs would not be lost if trading in Spanish shares migrated to a central platform run by SIX or Euronext. The country's government, which is expected to have the final say on any takeover, and Spanish markets watchdog CNMV had no comment. BME said it would keep its current business activities, Spanish headquarters and local strategy for a four-year transitional period at least.

UK's Johnson drops corporate tax cuts to fund spending as election nears,Nov 18 2019,"LONDON () - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday he was  putting on hold further cuts in corporation tax and told voters he would pump the money into services such as health instead, addressing a central issue in the Dec. 12 election. “We are postponing further cuts in corporation tax,” Johnson told business leaders at a conference organised by Britain's main business lobby, the CBI. “This saves 6 billion pounds that we can put into the priorities of the British people, including the NHS (National Health Service),” he said. Britain had been due to cut its corporation tax rate to 17% next year, down from 19% now, which is already one of the lowest among the world's big industrialised economies. Johnson has faced questions about how he would pay for the extra public spending that he has promised, without ramping up borrowing sharply. In September, his finance minister Sajid Javid announced the biggest increase in day-to-day spending in 15 years in what was widely seen as an attempt to counter the spending promises of the left-wing opposition Labour Party. Johnson's announcement received a cautious welcome from the head of the CBI. “Postponing further cuts to corporation tax to invest in public services could work for the country if it is backed by further efforts to the costs of doing business and promote growth,” Carolyn Fairbairn said in a statement.

"Euro zone growth has stabilized, ECB stimulus working as intended: Vasle",Nov 18 2019,"FRANKFURT () - Euro zone growth has stabilized and the European Central Bank's recent stimulus scheme is working as intended, even if markets may still need more time to fully grasp the scope of the package, Slovenian central bank chief Boštjan Vasle said.  Euro zone growth has slowed sharply over the past year and a long predicted rebound has failed to materialize, raising fears that the bloc could fall into recession, forcing the ECB to provide even more stimulus despite years of unprecedented support.  “I do not see any reason for a further change in growth prospects,” Vasle told  in an interview. “The (economy) is developing in a way which was predicted in our latest projections; at the moment things are under control, going in a direction which is not unexpected.” He added that data from industry and trade suggest that weak growth may continue into the first half of next year but signals from services and the labor market were more positive. The ECB cut rates deeper into negative territory in September and launched an indefinite bond purchase scheme to lower borrowing costs and spur growth, all with the ultimate aim of generating inflation. Vasle acknowledged that the ECB's policy space is limited, putting a greater burden on fiscal policymakers but said that the ECB still had some room to act, if needed. “We are in a situation where the business cycle is in the late phase, the economic situation is deteriorating and our monetary policy is quite stretched at the moment,” Vasle added. “What we decided in September, is working,” he added. “If the situation changes, there is still room to go in that direction (of lower rates).” Bond yields and some market interest rates have increased since the ECB unveiled its stimulus package but Vasle said this was not worrisome and financing conditions are still quite easy, supporting the ECB's aim to raising inflation back to just below 2 percent, a mark it has undershot since 2013. “Part of the explanation (for higher yields) lies in the underlying economic situation and part of it is related to the fact that our measures are for the longer term,” he said. “It's been too short of a time to judge the impact since we adapted the package.”     The ECB has long argued that the burden for raising growth now falls on governments and they should boost productivity and spend the cash saved from to lower central bank interest rates.  Governments have been slow in responding, however, as they focus on their national interests, firming the case for a euro area fiscal instrument that could be used during similar situations, Vasle argued. “We took big steps (with the monetary policy) but we came to a point when we need cooperation of other policies, as well,” Vasle said. “Governments have different goals as opposed to ECB,” Vasle said. “In a way the lack of action is understandable and that's why I am supporting the fiscal instrument on a euro area basis which would be designed exactly for this purpose to have a counterpart on the fiscal side with enough capacity.” ","{'neg': 0.08, 'neu': 0.811, 'pos': 0.108, 'compound': 0.9517}",0.9517

REFILE-Tata Steel plans to cut jobs across European operations,Nov 18 2019,"(Refiles to amend reporting and editing credits, widens distribution) * Tata says there will be no plant closures * Says aim is to ensure long-term future * Steel industry battling against costs, excess capacity LONDON, Nov 18 () - Tata Steel plans to cut jobs across its European operations as it wrestles with excess supply and high costs, the company said on Monday. Following a weekend interview in the Financial Times with the group's European chief executive, Henrik Adam, Tata confirmed it was planning to announce job cuts across the European business, which employs around 20,000 people. No numbers have been made public. Indian-owned Tata Steel, which launched a transformation programme in June to strengthen its European business, has operations including steelmaking in the Netherlands and Wales and downstream operations across Europe. There will be no plant closures but the aim is to shield the company against the “huge number of challenges” it faces, the company said. “We are working hard on our plans to be operationally cash positive,” Adam said, adding that the company was aiming for “a fundamental change”. A company spokesman confirmed Adam's comments originally made to the Financial Times. Steel making in Europe has come under strain from international competition and high energy costs, putting large numbers of well-paid jobs under threat. European steelmakers blame China for the extent of a surplus in the market, but the world's biggest steelmaker says it has made its own deep cuts to capacity. Britain last week announced that Chinese steelmaker Jingye has signed a provisional deal to buy British Steel, which went into compulsory liquidation in May. The agreement is politically resonant ahead of British elections as job opportunities have become a major issue. If confirmed, the rescue could save thousands of jobs. ArcelorMittal, the world's biggest steelmaker, has idled a series of plants across Europe. In an emailed statement on Monday, Tata Steel said challenging market conditions had been made “worse by the use of Europe as a dumping ground for the world's excess capacity”. The company's European transformation programme launched in June aimed to develop “a simpler and leaner organisation, capable of sustainably financing high levels of investment, Tata said. Changes will include streamlining supply chains and using technology to improve efficiency, as well as seeking to cut employment costs.

Rating agencies boost ESG risk analysis,Nov 18 2019,"LONDON, Nov 18 (LPC) - Credit rating agencies are increasing their efforts to identify environmental, social and governance risks for leveraged companies as investor interest in sustainable investments surges amid competition from independent ESG ratings firms. Sustainability risks have long been incorporated in traditional credit ratings, but agencies are now flagging relevant ESG risks for leveraged borrowers and capitalising on their access to information about privately owned companies, unlike independent ESG ratings firms, which tend to take information from public sources. Fitch Ratings launched its ESG approach for corporate and leveraged credits in January and shows relevant E, S, or G risks that can impact credit quality in a separate section of its credit reports. The firm aims to include the ESG approach in all published credit reports by mid-2020. “Our ESG approach doesn't change the fundamentals of our credit methodology,” said Andrew Steel, global head of sustainable finance at Fitch. “What it does is add transparency around the ESG elements. To use the analogy of baking a cake, the new format allows the end-consumer to see the balance of ingredients that went into the recipe.” Ratings changes relating to ESG risks will also be shown. “The extent to which ESG factors have made a difference to the eventual rating is clearly indicated by the relevance score,” Steel said. Other credit rating agencies are also ramping up their responses to leveraged credit investors' growing focus on ESG, with Moody's increasing the prominence of ESG analysis in its leveraged credit reports in September. “Our ratings capture ESG considerations with material credit implications,” said Lucia Lopez, a senior analyst at Moody's. “We are expanding our capability and range of tools available to market participants, such as corporate governance and carbon transition assessments, to address the growing market interest in ESG.” S&P Global Ratings has developed a separate ESG Evaluation product that takes a broader look at such risks, in addition to publishing reports that include relevant ESG risks for some sectors and companies, including some leveraged firms. NON-PUBLIC Traditional ratings agencies have access to companies' management and non-published numbers, unlike independent ESG ratings firms such as MSCI, which tend to analyse publicly available information. “We score customers against their peers on E, S and G factors. And we also look into how prepared they are to adapt to long-term disruption to their business strategy from an ESG perspective,” said Lynn Maxwell, head of sales for EMEA at S&P. “We are provided with access to an entity's board member to understand how they are positioning themselves for the future compared to what they currently do.” S&P issued an ESG score in July to Spanish telecom company Masmovil, which was the first borrower to incorporate ESG criteria as part of its leveraged loan. The deal included an ESG-linked pricing mechanism on undrawn capex and revolving credit facilities that was signed in May. The total €250m of undrawn facilities included a ratchet that can step up or down by 15bp if Mosmovil's ESG Evaluation score improves or deteriorates. S&P's ESG Evaluation goes beyond what is typically included in a credit rating analysis, as it takes a longer-term view of a company's prospects. “You could argue it's looking at similar issues as credit ratings, but an ESG Evaluation aims to give you an indication of the long-term survivability of a company rather than a view on its immediate default risk,” said Michael Wilkins, head of sustainable finance analytics and research at S&P. Leveraged investors welcome more detailed ESG information that will allow them to produce more transparent credit reports and monitor portfolios on an ongoing basis, which is currently proving difficult. “It's helpful. Going into a deal, you can get information and you can come up with your own ESG judgment. It's just monitoring and surveillance, how do you do that later on? That's one of the hardest things for us.” a CLO manager said. As ESG factors increasingly guide institutions' decisions to participate in deals, bankers are also having to work harder to identify and explain any ESG factors that could impact investors' perception and demand for deals. For example, banks faced repeated questioning from investors about concerns over animal welfare on the €970m buyout financing by Madrid-based theme park operator Parques Reunidos in September, due to its use of orca whales and zoo animals, which generate a relatively small part of the company's revenues.

"German business lobby, labour union jointly call on Berlin to boost public investment",Nov 18 2019,"BERLIN, Nov 18 () - Germany's BDI industry association and the DGB trade union called in a rare joint statement on Monday for the government to rethink its budget priorities and massively boost public investment to make Europe's largest economy fit for future growth. The unusual move by Germany's most influential business lobby group and the country's largest umbrella union show how much public debate has shifted in a country long obsessed with its “black zero” budget policy of no new debt. With the economy barely growing and Berlin's borrowing costs at record lows, Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz are facing growing pressure at home and abroad to ditch their self-imposed balanced budget pledge, which limits the fiscal room to increase public spending. “This is not primarily about fighting symptoms of a recession, but rather tackling the more deeply rooted causes of weak growth,” BDI President Dieter Kempf said, adding that the government had a duty to preserve and improve Germany as a business location in order to secure long-term prosperity and employment. Kempf said the government should increase public investment in digital and transportation infrastructure by half a percentage point of overall economic output, which would be roughly 16 billion euros per year. The federal budget foresees investments of 43 billion euros for 2020. DGB head Reiner Hoffmann said a long-term public investment programme was the only way to secure the sustainability of Germany's growth model and with it, well-paid jobs. “We can no longer afford it to put the prosperity of future generations at risk with such an outdated infrastructure and underfunded education system,” Hoffmann said, adding that more public investment would also strengthen social cohesion and promote equal living conditions across the country. Germany's state-owned development bank KfW has estimated that municipalities across the country are suffering from pent-up public investment needs of 138 billion euros.

"Indonesia's revenue behind target in Jan-Oct, pressuring budget deficit",Nov 18 2019,"JAKARTA, Nov 18 () - Indonesia reported a near flat income in January-October compared with the corresponding period a year earlier on Monday, as revenues from some taxes shrank, underlining the government's struggle to keep the budget deficit in check. Markets have been putting the government's budget under scrutiny after reports of sluggish tax collections that reflected weak company profits and slowing economic growth. Officials estimate this year's budget deficit at 2%-2.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) compared with a previously forecast 1.93% and an original plan of 1.84%. “Our assumption is in the higher end of that deficit range,” Suahasil Nazara, vice finance minister, told a news conference. Just 70% of the government's revenue target was met in the first 10 months of 2019, or 1,509 trillion rupiah ($107.51 million), representing 1.2% growth from the same period of 2018, data from the finance ministry showed. The government has targeted to collect 11.4% more in 2019 from what it gathered the previous year, assuming economic growth of 5.3%. However, officials say the likely GDP growth rate this year is 5.1%, down from 5.2% last year. Corporate tax payments grew just 2.2%, with those paid by firms in manufacturing, mining, construction and the oil and gas industry contracting. Value-added tax collection was down 4.2% in the period. Meanwhile, export tax payments plunged 50%, far sharper than the 7.8% on-year drop in export value within the same time frame. A rare bright spot on the revenue side was a nearly 300% increase in export tax payments from nickel ore shipments, though this amounted to just around 240 billion rupiah. In September, the government announced it would bring forward a nickel ore export ban to January 2020 from 2022, which triggered a jump in shipments amid rising prices. Officials declined to give an estimate for the tax shortfall in 2019. The government had disbursed 73% of its budget in January-October, totalling 1,798 trillion rupiah, and it would continue to support priority spending, Askolani, the finance ministry's director general of budgeting, said. There may be some “efficiency measures” to cut spending allocations that are not urgent, Askolani, who goes by one name, added without elaborating. Indonesia has raised 401.7 trillion rupiah from bond auctions, excluding short-term Treasury bills and buybacks, in anticipation of the wider budget deficit.

UPDATE 1-Gulf Keystone Petroleum names Ian Weatherdon as CFO,Nov 18 2019,"(Adds details on company, executives and background) Nov 18 () - Iraqi Kurdistan-focused Gulf Keystone Petroleum on Monday said it appointed Ian Weatherdon as chief financial officer to succeed Sami Zouari, who will step down on Dec. 2. Weatherdon, who was previously CFO at former Australia-listed Sino Gas & Energy, will join Gulf Keystone on Jan. 13, 2020, the company said. Zouari, whose departure was announced in June, had helped Gulf Keystone implement a capital structure in 2016, cutting the oil company's debt pile significantly. Gulf Keystone, however, is expected to produce lower volume of oil in 2019, following a delay in the start of drilling campaign and a planned shutdown of its second Shaikan production facility in October. Weatherdon was the finance chief at Sino Gas, which focused on developing natural gas assets in China, until the company was acquired by a private equity firm last year. He also held senior positions at Talisman Energy Inc, the Canadian exploration and production company that was acquired by Repsol SA in 2015, and helmed the role of a CFO at Equión Energía Ltd, a Colombian joint venture between Talisman Energy and Ecopetrol SA.

"U.S., South Korea resume defense cost-sharing talks amid protests of 'robbery'",Nov 18 2019,"SEOUL () - South Korean and U.S. officials resumed talks on Monday to narrow a $4 billion gap in how much they want Seoul to pay for the cost of hosting the American military amid public protests of “highway robbery” against sharply increased U.S. demands. U.S. President Donald Trump's demand that Seoul take on a greater share of the cost of stationing 28,500 U.S. troops as deterrence against North Korea has tested South Korea's confidence in the security alliance with Washington. Reports of Trump's $5 billion demand earlier this month were greeted with shock in Seoul and on Monday, progressive groups protested at the negotiation venue against what they said was “highway robbery” by “greedy” Americans.  South Korea's negotiating team is led by a former top financial regulator with experience in tough bargaining at times of crisis for Asia's fourth-largest economy, unprecedented in fronting a non-military expert in nearly 30 years of talks for the cost-sharing deals.  James DeHart, the chief U.S. negotiator, said there was a lot of work to do but sounded a note of optimism as he arrived in South Korea on Sunday. “I'm very confident that we will reach an agreement that is mutually acceptable, that both sides can support, and that will ultimately strengthen our great alliance,” he told reporters. Monday's meeting marked the third round of talks for him and the second for South Korea's Jeong Eun-bo, who was named to the job after the first round in September. He was previously vice chairman of the Financial Services Commission and a deputy finance minister. “His metier is budget, payment. I think the (South Korean) government decided that was the expertise needed this time,” said a person who had worked with Jeong, declining to be identified because of the sensitivity of the ongoing talks. Jeong was involved in South Korea's debt negotiations with international financial agencies during the 1998 Asian financial crisis, and currency swap deals during the 2008 global financial crisis, the person said. A South Korean lawmaker said earlier this month that U.S. officials had demanded up to $5 billion a year, more than five times the 1.04 trillion won ($896 million) Seoul agreed to pay this year. South Korea “is a wealthy country and could and should pay more”, U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said after his meeting with South Korea's Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo last week.  Trump has long railed against what he says are inadequate contributions from allies towards defense costs. The United States is due to begin separate negotiations for new defense cost-sharing deals with Japan, Germany and NATO next year. Trump has floated the idea of pulling U.S. troops from the Korean peninsula, which remains in a technical state of war under a truce that suspended the 1950-53 Korean War.  South Korea's Defense Ministry denied reports on some South Korean YouTube channels that U.S. troops would be withdrawn or reduced.  Esper “reaffirmed the commitment to maintain the current level of U.S. forces in Korea and to improve their combat readiness” last week, the Defense Ministry press office said on its Twitter feed.

China cuts short-term funding rate for first time since 2015,Nov 18 2019,"SHANGHAI () - China's central bank unexpectedly trimmed a closely watched lending rate on Monday, the first such cut in more than four years and a signal to markets that policymakers are ready to act to prop up slowing growth. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said on its website that it was lowering the seven-day reverse repurchase rate CN7DRRP=PBOC to 2.50% from 2.55%. The move cheered China's bond market and comes just two weeks after the PBOC cut the borrowing cost on its medium-term lending facility (MLF), used by banks for longer-dated funding needs, by the same margin. Both cuts raise the likelihood that the PBOC will trim its new benchmark loan prime rate (LPR), off of which many lenders base their mortgage rates, this week in a bid to free up funds to credit-starved parts of the economy. Analysts say the unexpected cut on Monday also shows the central bank is keen to ease investor worries that higher retail inflation would prevent it from delivering fresh stimulus. Zhou Hao, economist at Commerzbank in Singapore said the reverse repo rate cut indicates a policy change in coming months, including “some fine-tuning to prioritize the pro-growth policy for the time being.” Growth in the world's second-largest economy has eased to its slowest in nearly three decades and recent data such as credit growth and industrial output have continued to show a cooling economy. Driven by soaring pork prices due to the spread of African Swine Fever, China's consumer inflation rose past the government's target of around 3% in October to its fastest pace in almost eight years. That had raised some concerns the PBOC may be constrained in its efforts to ease policy. In a report released Saturday, the PBOC said it would maintain prudent monetary policy to prevent inflation from spreading. However, market participants believe the two recent market rate cuts suggest a similar adjustment in the LPR this week. Yan Se, chief economist at Founder Securities in Beijing, said the reverse repo rate cut showed authorities were open to using open market operations, typically used to meet the financial system's daily funding needs, to stimulate longer term growth in the real economy. “Commercial banks comprehensively evaluate financing costs to decide the LPR, so lowering reverse repo rates could maintain monetary policy stability,” Yan said. “Against the backdrop of such a situation, a five basis point reduction in LPR is a high probability event.” A cut to banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) is also possible, he added. Similarly, Commerzbank's Zhou expects a targeted RRR cut before the end of this year.  The PBOC announce its monthly LPR fixing on Wednesday. The rate on the one-year fixing CNYLPR1Y=CFXS now stands at 4.2% while the five-year CNYLPR5Y=CFXS is at 4.85%. Monday's repo rate cut bolstered the bond market, with China's benchmark 10-year treasury futures for December delivery CFTZ9 gaining more than 0.4% in the morning session. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said Monday's reverse repo rate cut is a step to lowering marginal funding costs for banks, which rely heavily on repos as a source of short-term liquidity. “With economic growth still slowing and unlikely to bottom out in the near-term, we think the PBOC will take further steps to shore up lending, which has weakened recently,” he said in a note, anticipating another 70-basis-point cut to the seven-day reverse repo rate by the middle of next year.  The PBOC had skipped reverse repo operations for 15 straight trading days before its injection of 180 billion yuan ($25.74 billion) into the interbank market on Monday.

Indian shares tick up; PSU banks lead gains,Nov 18 2019,"* NSE index rises 0.1%, BSE index gains 0.3% * PSU bank index rises 1.4% By Sethuraman N R Nov 18 () - Indian shares edged higher on Monday, driven mostly by a surge in banking stocks after the top court last week provided relief to lenders in a case related to a steel company and on hopes of more support from the government towards ailing sectors. The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the path for steelmaker ArcelorMittal SA to take over bankrupt Essar Steel, and the judgment comes as a big reprieve for banks which are struggling with bad loans worth $140 billion. “The Essar Steel verdict is very positive for the banking sector. Also, the banking sector results have been marginally better than expected,” said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services. The government is coming up with positive measures to help the economy and ailing sectors like telecom, boosting investor confidence, he added. The finance minister said on Friday the government was discussing the issue around telecom companies, but no final call had been taken yet. This comes after India's two top mobile carriers warned last week that their ability to operate and make profits would depend on relief from the government.

Ecuador lawmakers reject president's proposed economic reforms,Nov 18 2019,"QUITO - () - Ecuador's National Assembly on Sunday rejected a package of tax and monetary reforms proposed by President Lenin Moreno, a new setback in his efforts to reduce the country's burdensome fiscal deficit. The reforms stemmed from a loan agreement the government reached in February with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for about $4.2 billion. “With 70 affirmative votes, the National Assembly plenary decides to deny and archive the economic growth bill,” the legislature said on Twitter. The government's bill aimed to improve tax collection through the increase of some taxes and a special contribution for companies with revenues of more than $1 million annually. It also moved to give autonomy to the country's central bank and prevent it from becoming a direct source of government financing. Several of the proposals were opposed by the indigenous movement and social organizations, while others were questioned by the business sector.  The government, which had hoped to raise more than $700 million next year through the reforms, did not immediately comment on the assembly's decision. In mid-October Moreno abandoned measures to end fuel subsidies after almost two weeks of violent protests shook the Andean country. After repealing the decree that raised the price of extra gasoline and diesel, Moreno opened a round of dialogue with the indigenous movement. An agreement has yet to be reached.      “Social pressure first achieved the repeal of decree 883 (fuel subsidy) and today brought down another IMF imposition that undermined the rights of the people and was harmful to the country,” said the CONAIE indigenous group on Twitter after the rejection of Moreno's reform package. Ecuador expects a fiscal deficit of about $3.6 billion this year, with plans to lower it to $3.4 billion in 2020. ","{'neg': 0.113, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.074, 'compound': -0.91}",-0.91
UK lawmaker to cast blame on global banks in S.Africa Zuma corruption,Nov 18 2019,"JOHANNESBURG, Nov 18 () - British lawmaker Peter Hain will tell an inquiry on Monday that corruption under South Africa's former president Jacob Zuma was enabled by international banks, corporations and governments which should now seek to recover the loot they helped launder. Hain's submission on Monday to the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, part of which he shared with  in advance, will be “very critical of global corporates, especially banks, and states including the UK, Dubai, Hong Kong and India,” he wrote in an email. Zuma, who was removed as president last year over corruption allegations, is facing a judicial inquiry. He has agreed to cooperate even while dismissing the probe as prejudiced. Part of its brief is to investigate accusations that three prominent businessmen - brothers Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta — influenced Zuma over political appointments and state contracts. Hain, a labour member of parliament and former anti-Apartheid activist, will call on the banks, global corporates and foreign governments to cooperate better so all those involved in the pillaging of South Africa are brought to justice. His submission will say that a number of international banks helped the Guptas cloak the source of their funds - by allowing them to open and maintain bank accounts, even after allegations of their involvement in corruption became public, and also by allowing them to transfer illicit funds into these accounts. The role of global finance in facilitating corruption, fraud and money laundering has come under increasing scrutiny over the past decade, but the fight against financial crime is mostly dealt with by national authorities who often fail to cooperate effectively. Among his recommendations will be to improve transparency around the beneficial owners of companies. He will also propose better programmes for auditing the due diligence conducted by banks to ensure that they are complying with anti-money laundering laws, and stiffer penalties for individuals and organisations that fail to do so. South Africa's anti-graft ombudsman found in 2017 that Zuma may have granted the Gupta business family improper control of government functions, including the appointment of ministers. The Guptas also deny the accusations and say they have been victims of a political attack. They have since closed their South African operations in mining, media and technology.

Lebanon slips deeper into crisis after Safadi withdrawal,Nov 17 2019,"BEIRUT () - Protesters waving Lebanese flags rallied in cities and towns in their thousands on Sunday to mark a month of protests against the ruling elite as politicians struggled to form a government and solve the worst economic crisis since the 1975-90 civil war. Lebanon's political troubles deepened further after the withdrawal of a top candidate for prime minister narrowed the chances of creating a government needed to enact urgent reforms. Mohammad Safadi, a former finance minister, withdrew his candidacy late on Saturday, saying it was too hard to form a “harmonious” government with broad support. Safadi was the first candidate who had appeared to win some consensus among Lebanon's fractious sectarian-based parties since Hariri quit as prime minister on Oct. 29, pushed out by sweeping protests against the ruling elite. Faced by the worst financial strains since the civil war, Lebanon has pledged urgent reforms it hopes will convince donors to disburse some $11 billion pledged last year. The unrest has kept banks shut for most of the last month. They have imposed controls on transfers abroad and U.S. dollar withdrawals, and the pegged Lebanese pound is under pressure on an informal market. Late on Sunday large crowds of anti-government protesters poured into cities and towns across the country against an establishment widely seen as venal, sectarian and incompetent. “We are staying here. We don't know how long - maybe one or two months or one or two years,” said Perla Joe Maalouli, 27, a filmmaker.”Maybe it will take 10 years to get the state we are dreaming of, but everything starts with a first step.” Protesters who have filled the streets since Oct. 17 hit out at the choice of Safadi, a businessman and longtime politician they said was part of the elite they sought to oust. “We are in a deadlock now. I don't know when it will move again. It is not easy,” said a senior political source. “The financial situation doesn't tolerate any delay.”  A second political source described efforts to form a new government as “back to square one”.         Safadi became the presumed front-runner for prime minister after a meeting between Hariri, a Sunni politician, and Shi'ite groups Hezbollah and Amal, according to political sources and Lebanese media, but no political force later endorsed him. Lebanon's prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim, according to its sectarian power-sharing system. Army chief General Joseph Aoun said the military would not stop people from demonstrating in squares but would intervene to open roads, calling freedom of movement “sacred”.  Reflecting the bad-tempered political climate, President Michel Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) accused Hariri of failing to rally support for Safadi's bid in order to undermine his candidacy and keep the job for himself. An FPM statement criticized Hariri for insisting on a policy of “me or no one” to lead the next government, a reference to Hariri's insistence on returning as premier only if he can be the sole politician in a cabinet of specialists. A statement by Hariri's office rejected FPM's assertion that he undermined Safadi's candidacy as an irresponsible attempt to “score points” despite Lebanon's “major national crisis”. But in a statement Safadi later blamed Hariri for not keeping “promises on the basis of which I accepted to be named prime minister of the next government”. He did not say what the promises were, but added: “There was nothing left for me to do but announce my withdrawal.” Safadi's withdrawal leaves the powerful, Iran-backed Hezbollah and its allies with even fewer options unless they push for a close Sunni ally, a scenario that would likely reduce the chances of Lebanon winning international support. Hezbollah is classified as a terrorist group by the United States. Hezbollah and Amal, along with Aoun, a Maronite Christian, have sought for Hariri to return as premier while including both technocrats and politicians in a new cabinet. But Hariri, aligned with Gulf Arabs and the West, has said he will return as prime minister only if he can form a cabinet composed of specialists who can attract international support. Global ratings agency S&P flashed a warning on Lebanon, lowering its foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings deeper into junk territory to ‘CCC/C' from ‘B-/B'. Lebanon's banking association said it had agreed a set of temporary directives for commercial banks that include a $1,000 cap on weekly withdrawals from U.S. dollar accounts. The steps  were intended to standardize the work of banks amid the country's “exceptional circumstances,” it said. Bank staff plan to continue a nationwide strike on Monday over safety fears as depositors demand access to their money. ","{'neg': 0.105, 'neu': 0.801, 'pos': 0.095, 'compound': -0.7405}",-0.7405
Renault to have CEO shortlist soon but not in rush: Sueddeutsche Zeitung,Nov 18 2019,"FRANKFURT () - Renault () will have soon drawn up a shortlist of candidates for chief executive officer but there is no rush, the French carmaker's chairman told a German newspaper. Renault ousted chief executive Thierry Bollore in October as the carmaker and its Japanese partner Nissan () have tried to rekindle their relationship after the arrest of the alliance's former head Carlos Ghosn. “If we select a person by the end of the year, all the better. If not, it's not a bad thing,” Jean-Dominique Senard told Seuddeutsche Zeitung in an interview published on Sunday. He praised Renault's finance director, Clotilde Delbos, who took over as interim CEO. Bollore had been close to Ghosn and had strained relations with Nissan's previous boss. Appointing new faces at the helm of Renault could help draw a line under almost a year of turmoil and revive cooperation between two carmakers once seen as destined to a full merger. Senard did not rule out reducing Renault's stake in Nissan, which he said the Japanese firm had long demanded. The French company holds 43% of Nissan's shares. “Things are not written for all eternity,” Senard said. “However, a reduction in shares must make sense.”  French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday that the search was ongoing for a new CEO and that he favoured selecting a professional from the automobile sector.

Sri Lanka strongman Rajapaksa wins presidency by big margin,Nov 17 2019,"COLOMBO () - Sri Lanka's former civil wartime defense chief Gotabaya Rajapaksa was declared the winner in the presidential election on Sunday, after promising to secure the country against militant threats following Easter bombings this year. Rajapaksa, who will be sworn into office in an ancient Buddhist temple on Monday, is the latest nationalist leader to sweep to election victory, tapping into the anger and fears of majority communities. In his first comments after defeating Sajith Premadasa, a housing minister in the current government, Rajapaksa struck a conciliatory note, suggesting he would be leader of all Sri Lankans, regardless of their ethnic and religious identities.    “As we usher in a new journey for Sri Lanka, we must remember that all Sri Lankans are part of this journey. Let us rejoice peacefully, with dignity and discipline in the same manner in which we campaigned,” Rajapaksa said in a tweet.   The election commission said Rajapaksa won 52.25% of the votes in Saturday's election, while Premadasa got 41.99%, giving Rajapaksa a far bigger lead than predicted by politicians and analysts. Millions voted to elect a new president to lead the country out of its deepest economic slump in over 15 years, dragged down by its tourism sector following the bombings on April 21 which killed more than 250 people. Rajapaksa, 70, oversaw the military defeat of Tamil separatists under his brother and then president Mahinda Rajapaksa 10 years ago. He has promised strong leadership to secure the island of 22 million people, the majority of whom are Sinhalese Buddhists. Rajapaksa and his brothers, who are expected to get key positions, are seen as closer to China than Premadasa. China has invested billions of dollars building ports, expressways and power stations in the strategic Indian Ocean island nation. But these projects have also led to high debt levels for Sri Lanka. Finance minister Mangala Samaraweera and two other ministers resigned on Sunday after the defeat of the ruling party's candidate in the election. Tamil political parties are strongly opposed to Rajapaksa, who has faced allegations of widespread human rights violations of civilians in the final stages of the war against the separatists in 2009.  Rajapaksa and his brother deny the allegations.  Muslims, the other large minority group, say they too have faced hostility since the April attacks on hotels and churches in which more than 250 people were killed. Islamic State claimed responsibility. “His victory shows a division, and this could create more issues specially for other ethnic groups. I don't know how he will tackle Muslims and Tamils,” said Victor Ivan, a political columnist. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet he looked forward to working with Rajapaksa. Sri Lanka, sitting near shipping lanes in the Indian Ocean, has become an arena of contest between regional heavyweights India and China. Beijing stepped in for post-war reconstruction after the West and India shunned the Rajapaksas because of the allegations of rights violations at the end of the civil war.  Now that the family was returning to power, China will likely be the gainer, said an analyst. “We're likely to see a pivot toward China once again. China is likely very happy that Gota has won,” said Akhil Bery of the Eurasia group. During the campaign, Rajapaksa promised to cut the 15% value added tax by nearly half and abolish some other taxes, as a way to reignite consumption and growth. These cuts could lead to a loss of more than 600 billion rupees ($3.31 billion) in tax revenues, finance ministry officials say, adding to the pressure on public finances at a time when the country is under a $1.5 billion, four-year IMF loan program.

French lottery operator IPO draws retail investors: minister,Nov 17 2019,"PARIS () - The initial public offering (IPO) of French lottery operator Francaise des Jeux (FDJ) has proved a “popular success”, drawing subscriptions from retail investors worth 1 billion euros ($1.10 billion), the finance minister said on Saturday. The government began the sale of its majority stake in FDJ on Thursday. It is expected to raise up to 1.7 billion euros from the listing, part of France's biggest wave of privatizations in more than a decade. “It is a tremendous, popular success,” Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told BFM television, adding that retail investor subscriptions had reached 1 billion euros. About a third of shares are earmarked for retail investors. The bookrunner has said the IPO was oversubscribed in a range of 18.50 euros and 19.90 euros. The initial price guidance for the IPO was 16.50-19.90 euros. Le Maire told BFM he would set a final price next week, ahead of trading that is due to begin on Nov. 21. If the listing goes smoothly, it could embolden the government to press on with other big asset sales, such as the more lucrative but politically trickier sale of airports operator ADP DAP.PA and a stake in power group Engie (). The state wants to sell all or part of its 50.6% stake in ADP worth around 8.6 billion euros but opponents have organized an online referendum to stop it. Le Maire told BFM a decision on ADP would be taken once the result of the referendum was clear, meaning it would not proceed until after local elections in March. Regarding Engie, Le Maire said the state planned to sell the stake “at the right time” and said it would be “within months rather than before the end of the year”.

France's Le Maire favors car industry professional as next Renault CEO,Nov 17 2019,"PARIS () - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday that the search for a new CEO for Renault () was still on and that he favored selecting a professional from the automobile sector. “I can confirm the next CEO has not yet been chosen. The only indication I can give you is that I wish it is a professional of the car industry because amid the radical transformation of the sector, one needs professionals,” Le Maire told BFM television. The French carmaker, chaired by Jean-Dominique Senard, a former executive at tire maker Michelin who was parachuted in following the Carlos Ghosn scandal, is expected to choose a new CEO by the end of the year so that the group can try and fully refocus on its operations. The French state has a 15% stake in Renault. Renault's interim chief executive Clotilde Delbos has applied to take the job on a permanent basis, two sources familiar with the matter have said, as the carmaker edges toward a shortlist likely to also feature several external candidates. One of the sources had said that Patrick Koller, the Franco-German CEO of car parts maker Faurecia () , and Luca de Meo, the Italian boss of Volkswagen-owned SEAT, also ticked many of the boxes for recruiters, including that they both spoke French.

Crisis-swept Lebanon in gridlock after Safadi withdrawal,Nov 17 2019,"* No clear candidate for PM after Safadi withdrawal * New cabinet needed to enact urgent reforms * Banks could re-open as early as Monday BEIRUT, Nov 17 () - Lebanon slipped deeper into political crisis on Sunday after the withdrawal of a top candidate for prime minister narrowed the chances of creating a government needed to enact urgent reforms. Mohammad Safadi, a former finance minister, withdrew his candidacy late on Saturday, saying it was too difficult to form a “harmonious” government with broad political support. Safadi was the first candidate who had appeared to win some consensus among Lebanon's fractious sectarian-based parties since Hariri quit as prime minister on Oct. 29, pushed out by sweeping protests against the ruling elite. Faced by the worst financial strains since its 1975-1990 civil war, Lebanon has pledged to carry out urgent reforms it hopes will convince donors to disburse some $11 billion pledged at a conference last year. The unrest has kept banks shut for most of the last month. They have imposed controls on transfers abroad and U.S. dollar withdrawals, and the pegged Lebanese pound is under pressure on an informal market. Safadi became the presumed front-runner for prime minister after a meeting between Hariri, a Sunni politician, and Shi'ite groups Hezbollah and Amal, according to political sources and Lebanese media, but no political force later endorsed him. Lebanon's prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim, according to its sectarian power-sharing system. Protesters who have filled Lebanon's streets since Oct. 17 denounced the choice of Safadi, a prominent businessman and longtime politician they said was part of the elite they sought to oust. “We are in a deadlock now.

S&P cited rising pressure on central bank foreign currency reserves and diminished depositor confidence brought on by the bank closures and reported restrictions on hard currency movement. Lebanon's bank staff union said it would meet on Sunday or Monday to decide whether to call off a strike after receiving a security plan to keep branches safe and potentially re-open banks as early as Monday.

"Lebanon's Safadi withdraws candidacy for PM, urges Hariri for post: statement",Nov 17 2019,"BEIRUT () - Former Lebanese finance minister Mohammad Safadi withdrew his candidacy to be the next prime minister on Saturday, saying that he saw that it would have been difficult to form a “harmonious” cabinet supported by all parties. Safadi, 75, emerged as a candidate on Thursday when political sources and Lebanese media said three major parties had agreed to support him for the position.  His decision to withdraw throws Lebanon's push to form a government needed to enact urgent reforms back to square one in the face of unprecedented protests that prompted prime minister Saad al-Hariri to resign last month. Safadi said in a statement that he had decided to withdraw following consultations with political parties and a meeting on Saturday with Hariri. “It is difficult to form a harmonious government supported by all political sides that could take the immediate salvation steps needed to halt the country's economic and financial deterioration and respond to the aspirations of people in the street,” the statement said. Protesters who took to the streets on Saturday denounced Safadi's potential nomination, saying it ran counter to nationwide calls to oust a political elite they see him as part and parcel of. In the statement Safadi, a prominent businessman with ties to Saudi Arabia, thanked President Michel Aoun and Hariri for supporting his candidacy, and said he hoped Hariri would return as premier to form a new government. Shi'ite group Hezbollah and its Shi'ite ally Amal had agreed to back Safadi following a meeting with Hariri late on Thursday, according to Lebanese media and political sources, but no political party had since formally endorsed his candidacy.

Cuba cries foul as doctors head home from Bolivia,Nov 16 2019,"HAVANA () - The first of around 700 Cuban doctors were scheduled to fly home from strife-torn Bolivia on Saturday as officials railed against what they charged was slander and mistreatment by Bolivia's conservative interim government. Cuba said Saturday that 10 doctors, including the coordinator of its medical mission, were detained this week and four remained in custody. On Friday, the foreign ministry said it was terminating its medical mission as officials were fostering violence against the doctors by claiming they were instigating rebellion. The Communist-run island nation was a key ally of former leftist President Evo Morales, who resigned under pressure on Sunday and fled to Mexico after weeks of protests and violence over a disputed Oct. 20 election. Cuba has backed Morales' assertion that he was toppled in a foreign-backed coup. Protests by Morales' supporters have continued in capital La Paz, nearby El Alto, and the central city of Cochabamba, where at least five protesters were killed on Friday and hundreds reportedly detained. The four doctors still in custody were picked up on Wednesday after withdrawing a significant amount of cash from the bank, which the government charged was to finance protests. The Cuban foreign ministry countered the doctors withdrew the same amount of money every month to cover expenses of 107 doctors working in the La Paz area. “Cease the irresponsible anti-Cuban expressions of hate, lies, defamations and instigations to violence against Cuban cooperators,” President Miguel Diaz-Canel tweeted on Friday.  Bolivia's interim Foreign Minister Karen Longaric said Friday upon announcing Cuba would fly home its doctors that “there have been a number of accusations that Cuban citizens have been involved in these aggressive acts that have tormented our country in recent days.”  Brazil and Ecuador have acted similarly against Cubans in recent months as they aligned themselves more closely with the United States. The Caribbean island nation has a respected health service and generates export earnings by sending more than 30,000 health workers to more than 60 countries.  The United States has accused Cuba of mistreating its doctors and pressuring them to take part in political activities. It has asked governments to stop contracting them. Cuba denies the charges and says they are part of the Trump administration's efforts to slander the country even as it applies new sanctions on top of old to deny it revenues used in part to provide free health services to its population.

Lebanon's Speaker Berri says situation in Lebanon getting more 'complicated': Al Joumhouria,Nov 16 2019,"BEIRUT () - The situation in Lebanon is becoming more complicated, Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri was cited as saying by newspaper al-Joumhouria on Saturday, comments that suggested a deal needed to form a new government had yet to be finalised. Lebanon appeared to move toward consensus on a new premier on Thursday after caretaker prime minister Saad al-Hariri, a Sunni politician, and Shi'ite group Hezbollah and its Shi'ite ally Amal agreed to back ex-finance minister Mohammad Safadi, according to political sources and local media. But no political force has since formally endorsed Safadi and no date has yet been set for formal consultations required to designate a new prime minister. “Things are becoming more complicated and a quick solution is needed to get Lebanon out of this crisis,” Berri said, according to al-Joumhouria.  Hariri quit as prime minister on Oct. 29 in the face of protests against ruling politicians who are blamed for rampant state corruption and steering Lebanon into its worst economic crisis since the 1975-90 civil war. Some protesters have rejected Safadi's potential nomination, saying it would run counter to nationwide protests calling to oust a political elite they see him as part of. Safadi is a prominent businessman and former member of parliament from the predominantly Sunni city of Tripoli. He was finance minister from 2011 to 2014 under Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and was also previously minister of economy and trade.    Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil was cited by Lebanese broadcaster MTV as saying that Safadi had agreed to be prime minister if he wins the support of the country's leading parties.

S&P downgrades Lebanon's credit rating amidst ongoing protests,Nov 16 2019,"() - S&P Global Ratings said on Friday that it lowered Lebanon's long-term and short-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings to ‘CCC/C' from ‘B-/B', citing rising financial and monetary risks. The outlook on Lebanon is negative, S&P said  specifying that it reflects the risk to Lebanon's credit worthiness from rising financial and monetary pressures tied to recent widespread protests and the resignation of the government.  Nationwide protests driven in part by the worst economic crisis since the country's 1975-1990 civil war have shut banks and paralyzed the country, limiting the ability of many importers to purchase from abroad. Saad al-Hariri quit as prime minister on Oct. 29 in the face of the protests against ruling politicians who are blamed for rampant state corruption.  Mohammad Safadi, a former finance minister, has agreed to be Lebanon's prime minister if he wins the support of the leading parties, Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil said earlier on Friday. Confidence in the country's governance and its economy is falling, which has led to a reversal in bank deposit inflows, S&P noted, adding that the Lebanese government will need external donor support or a major domestic reform package to continue its general government debt. On Thursday, the ratings agency lowered the ratings on three Lebanese banks - Bank Audi (), Blom Bank () and Bankmed - further into junk, citing rising liquidity pressures.

"U.S. may remove Sudan from list of state sponsors of terrorism, but it's a process: U.S. official",Nov 16 2019,"WASHINGTON () - The United States no longer has an adversarial relationship with the Sudanese government and is working with its counterparts on the possibility of removing it from a list of state sponsors of terrorism, a senior State Department official said on Friday. But Tibor Nagy, assistant secretary for African affairs, cautioned that doing so was a process with conditions. “It's not an event, it's not flipping a light switch. It's a process and we are heavily, continuously engaged with our Sudanese interlocutors on how we can go about doing that,” he told reporters in a briefing.  Asked if the United States was committing to lifting sanctions, Nagy said “No” but added: “There are conditions to such an event. Everybody is hoping that it will happen, everybody is hoping that it happens as quickly as possible, we all understand the hardships that it is causing, he said. The U.S. government added Sudan to its list of state sponsors of terrorism in 1993 over allegations that then-President Omar al-Bashir's Islamist government was supporting terrorist groups. The designation makes Sudan technically ineligible for debt relief and financing from the IMF and World Bank. Congress needs to approve a removal. Months of demonstrations over price hikes for fuel and bread and cash shortages led to an uprising against Bashir, who was toppled by the military in April. A civilian transitional government was formed in August and it agreed with the United States that it could start engaging with international institutions while still on a list of countries deemed sponsors of terrorism.

"Fed says U.S. financial system resilient; flags low rates, 'stablecoin' as risks",Nov 16 2019,"WASHINGTON () - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Friday flagged high levels of corporate debt, the impact of an extended period of low global interest rates, and emerging “stablecoin” cryptocurrency proposals as potential risks to the financial system. In its latest twice-yearly review of financial stability, the Fed said that overall financial stability conditions had changed little since its last report in May, and that “the core of the financial sector appears resilient.” Some asset values are high, the Fed noted, pointing in particular to commercial real estate values. But “risk appetite” was felt to be in line with “historical norms,” household debt “at a modest level relative to income,” leverage levels low among the largest banks, and the use of potentially volatile short-term funding posing only a modest risk to financial institutions.    But the report highlighted the Fed's ongoing concern with record high levels of corporate debt, which some Fed officials worry could go bad if business slows and worsen any economic downturn. In addition, the Fed said low global borrowing costs could over time erode bank, insurance company, and pension fund returns, prompting them to take more risks. “The current combination of very low credit spreads and high levels of indebtedness among risky nonfinancial corporates, including through leveraged loans, merits heightened vigilance,” Fed Governor Lael Brainard said in a prepared statement. “Over the medium term, the low-for-long environment and the associated incentives to reach for yield and take on additional debt could increase financial vulnerabilities.” But the most pointed commentary was directed at “stablecoins,” an effort, most prominently by Facebook through its proposed “Libra” initiative, to remove volatility from crypto currencies by tying them to an underlying basket of assets.   The Fed devoted a section of the report to the idea, warning that while that and other innovative, technology-driven financial products could serve as a new medium of exchange, the financial system could face “potentially severe consequences” if a broad-based stablecoin is poorly designed or regulated.  “The possibility for a stablecoin payment network to quickly achieve global scale introduces important challenges and risks related to financial stability, monetary policy, safeguards against money laundering and terrorist financing, and consumer and investor protection,” the report concluded. Shortly after Facebook announced plans to use its massive platform to help establish a global stablecoin, the Fed said it raised a host of regulatory, anti-money laundering, and consumer protection challenges that must be addressed before any product launch. The financial stability report was inaugurated a year ago, part of a growing effort by the central ban to better understand the risks posed by financial markets to the broader economy. The last two U.S. recessions emanated from the financial sector - the collapse of the dot-com stock bubble at the start of the century, and the meltdown of the subprime housing market ahead of the 2007 to 2009 slowdown - and policymakers see the report as a way to identify problems before they become acute.  The last few months have been volatile ones for stock and bond markets, with tensions heightened due to the U.S.-China trade war, a slowing global economy, and a list of geopolitical risks. Central banks globally have cut interest rates as a result, with three Fed rate cuts in particular easing tensions in bond markets and recently boosting activity in housing and other credit-sensitive sectors. In a Fed survey of investors and government contacts, however, “trade frictions” were cited as the chief economic risk, followed by concerns that looser monetary policy could lead to “excessive risk-taking.”  The “historically high” level of corporate debt is part of that, and a risk that Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly cited since taking over as head of the central bank. Business credit has continued to grow faster than the economy, the Fed noted, debt is high relative to both the size of the U.S. economy and the size of corporate balance sheets, and the fastest increases have been in “debt extended to firms with poorer credit profiles.” So far, however, low borrowing costs have made that debt sustainable.      “Broader corporate credit performance remains favorable amid a strong economy, and, with interest rates low by historical standards, debt service costs are at the lower ends of their historical ranges, particularly for risky firms,” the Fed concluded.

WeWork faces U.S. SEC inquiry over possible rule violations: Bloomberg,Nov 16 2019,"() - WeWork is facing scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over whether it violated financial rules in the run-up to its abandoned initial public offering, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing two people with knowledge of the matter. The SEC's inquiry is preliminary and may not lead to any allegations of wrongdoing, Bloomberg reported, adding that it could not determine whether specific WeWork business decisions or transactions prompted the review. WeWork shelved its IPO in September after investors grew wary of its mounting losses, a business model with high leasing liabilities and corporate governance that forced former chief executive and co-founder Adam Neumann to resign. Neumann and other WeWork officials are also being sued by minority shareholders who accuse the company's board of directors of breaching its fiduciary duties. Masayoshi Son, chairman of SoftBank Group which took control of WeWork last month, is also one of the defendants in the case. The SEC's enforcement division is reviewing WeWork's business and its disclosures to investors after media reports showed conflicts of interest and the company's fundraising, according to the report.   WeWork has retained top Wall Street lawyer Andrew Ceresney, who previously headed the SEC enforcement unit, Bloomberg reported.  WeWork and the SEC declined to comment. The SEC took issue with WeWork's use of non-regular financial reporting rules, including a profitability measure it dubbed “contribution margin,” the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. The SEC told WeWork the term could be misleading. WeWork should have clearly indicated its losses would continue to mount in the near term in its IPO filing, analysts have said. WeWork also failed to provide a cash flow statement that would show it would run out of money if it did not receive anticipated financing from the shelved IPO. Neumann has been accused of self-dealing, or acting in his own interests instead of the company's. Neumann earned $5.9 million for selling the rights for the name We Company, WeWork's parent, which he returned in September after a public outcry. Material information also was omitted in the IPO filing, including that Neumann had been on the board's compensation committee when he was CEO, the Journal reported in October. The We Company on Wednesday said net losses in the third quarter more than doubled to $1.25 billion. ","{'neg': 0.093, 'neu': 0.868, 'pos': 0.039, 'compound': -0.9705}",-0.9705

UPDATE 2-U.S. prosecutors probe Trump lawyer Giuliani ties to Ukrainian projects -WSJ,Nov 16 2019,"(Adds comment from lawyer for Giuliani, details from Journal article, background) WASHINGTON, Nov 15 () - Federal prosecutors are examining whether U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani stood to profit from a Ukrainian natural gas business pushed by two associates who aided his efforts to launch investigations that could help the president, the Wall Street Journal said on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. The associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, pitched their company, and plans for a Poland-to-Ukraine pipeline carrying U.S. natural gas, to Ukrainian officials and energy executives this year, and said the project had White House support, the newspaper said, citing people briefed on the meetings. Parnas and Fruman also told Ukrainian officials that Giuliani was a partner in the pipeline venture, a project of their company Global Energy Producers, the newspaper said, citing one of the people. Giuliani has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing. In a Friday interview with the newspaper, he denied involvement in the energy company and pipeline pitch, and said he had no indication prosecutors were looking into the matter. “Mr. Giuliani was never a partner in GEP and any reports to the contrary are false and categorically denied,” Robert Costello, a lawyer for Giuliani, told . Citing some of the people briefed on the meetings, the Journal also said Parnas and Fruman pushed for help on an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. The federal prosecutors, in New York, are examining whether Giuliani violated lobbying laws in connection with his Ukraine work, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the investigation. Lawyers for Parnas and Fruman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. John Dowd, a lawyer who has represented them in the past, declined to comment. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan also declined to comment. Parnas and Fruman were arrested in October on charges of illegally funneling money to U.S. politicians, including to an election committee for Trump. They have pleaded not guilty. Giuliani is central to a Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives impeachment inquiry into whether Trump, a Republican, abused his office for political gain. He told the Journal that had Parnas and Fruman sought his legal advice, he would have told them to avoid involvement in any “ownership situation” in Ukraine while working alongside him. “I am not a part of the ownership, or any other involvement with GEP,” Giuliani said. “I never agreed to be part of it.

U.S. to strictly enforce anti-money laundering rules in cryptocurrencies: FinCEN chief,Nov 16 2019,"NEW YORK () - The U.S. government will strictly enforce a rule that requires cryptocurrency firms engaged in money service businesses such as  digital asset exchanges and wallet service providers to share information about their customers, Kenneth Blanco, director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), said on Friday Part of anti-money laundering regulations, the “travel rule” requires cryptocurrency exchanges to verify their customers' identities, identify the original parties and beneficiaries of transfers $3,000 or higher, and transmit that information to counterparties if they exist. “It (travel rule) applies to CVCs (convertible virtual currencies) and we expect that you will comply period,” Blanco said at a conference hosted by Chainalysis, a New York-based blockchain analysis company.  “That's what our expectation is. You will comply. I don't know what the shock is. This is nothing new,” he added. The U.S. government's moves came as cryptocurrency crime soared into the billions of dollars, with global investigators grappling with major money laundering hubs that are at the center of the virtual worlds. Ciphertrace, in a recent report released in August, said cryptocurrency thefts, scams, and fraud may exceed more than $4.3 billion this year. The travel rule was first issued by FinCEN in 1996 as part of anti-money laundering standards that applies to all U.S. financial institutions. FinCEN expanded the rule's coverage in March 2013 to apply to crypto exchanges as well, and in May this year, the Treasury unit affirmed that guidance.     The government's action comes on the heels of guidelines released in June by the U.S. Treasury led-Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental global organization devoted to battling money laundering and terrorism financing. FATF likewise directed crypto exchanges and regulators around the world to comply with the travel rule, giving them about year to do it from June this year. “FinCEN...has been conducting examinations that include compliance with the funds' travel rule since 2014,” Blanco said, adding that it is the most commonly cited violation with regard to money service businesses engaged in virtual currencies. FinCEN's May guidance on the travel rule created confusion within the crypto industry, which believes the rule didn't apply to them. In an earlier interview, Dave Jevans, chief executive officer of U.S. blockchain forensics company CipherTrace, said people in the crypto industry were surprised at FinCEN's recent actions because digital currencies have never been classified as money and the belief was that the travel rule does not apply to them.

'Hanging by its fingernails': U.S. biodiesel industry struggles without subsidy,Nov 16 2019,"NEW YORK () - When John Whittington shut his Morristown, Indiana, biodiesel plant this week, he knew the move would leave all 14 of his workers there looking for jobs heading into the U.S. holiday season. But he felt he had no choice.  A $1-per-gallon subsidy that had been propping up the industry since 2005 lapsed at the beginning of 2018 due to Congressional inaction, and his hopes for a swift renewal had been declining along with his business ever since. “I didn't (lay off my workers) because they failed,” Whittington, co-owner of Integrity Biofuels, said. “To me, the support systems of the industry have failed.” Integrity Biofuels' shutdown marks the tenth biodiesel facility to have idled this year after the lapse in the biodiesel credit, putting about 250 people out of work, according to the National Biodiesel Board (NBB). Nationwide production has decreased about 10% year-on-year, according to Energy Information Administration data. The biodiesel credit was part of a broad legislative effort more than a decade ago to help farmers and reduce petroleum imports by supporting biofuels. At a cost of nearly $2 billion per year, it is among the most expensive U.S. energy subsidy programs.  Its lapse has added pressure on Midwest farmers, a key constituency in the 2020 presidential election already struggling under poor planting conditions and the fallout from the U.S.-China trade war. In August, some 90 U.S. facilities produced 156 million gallons of the fuel - made from agricultural oils, recycled cooking oil and animal fats - from 172 million gallons a year earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administrati Other plants that have cut production include facilities run by players like Flint Hills Resources, World Energy and REG. In recent weeks, industry associations, biodiesel producers and lawmakers seeking to prevent further shutdowns and layoffs have packed pressure on Congressional leadership to renew the so-called Biodiesel Blenders Tax Credit for buyers of the fuel. On Thursday about 140 companies and organizations sent a letter to House and Senate leadership, urging them to extend the credit before the end of the year. “Producers are now cutting back production, purchases of raw materials, and deliveries of renewable fuel to consumers, which will have impacts across the economy,” the letter said. The industry's advocates want the biodiesel credit to be included in a government funding package to be passed before the end of the year. Whether the credit is included is up to House and Senate lawmakers negotiating it, a House Democratic aide said. In the past Congress has retroactively renewed it with sweeping bipartisan support.  But this lapse has been longer than ever. The government shutdown late last year diverted Congress' attention from addressing the issue, said Paul Winters, a spokesman for the NBB industry group. Biodiesel groups argue this has thrown confusion into future supply contracts and tightened credit lines.  “A lot of companies have been hanging on by their fingernails,” Winters said.  Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a biodiesel advocate who serves as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said the renewal has been complicated by a general decrease in bipartisanship in legislative negotiations.  Industry players worry Congressional impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump will further reduce the chances of a renewal.  “A lot of us are fearful,” said Michael McAdams, president of the Advanced Biofuels Association.

Sri Lanka presidential election: Former defence chief Gotabaya Rajapaksa sweeps to victory,Nov 18 2019,"COLOMBO • Sri Lanka's former civil war-time defence chief Gotabaya Rajapaksa was declared the winner in the presidential election yesterday, after promising to secure the country against militant threats following the Easter bombings this year. Mr Rajapaksa, who will be sworn into office in an ancient Buddhist temple today, is the latest nationalist leader to sweep to election victory, tapping the anger and fears of majority communities. In his first comments after defeating Mr Sajith Premadasa, the Housing Minister in the current government, Mr Rajapaksa struck a conciliatory note, suggesting he would be leader of all Sri Lankans, regardless of their ethnic and religious identities. ""As we usher in a new journey for Sri Lanka, we must remember that all Sri Lankans are part of this journey. Let us rejoice peacefully, with dignity and discipline in the same manner in which we campaigned,"" he said in a tweet. The Election Commission said Mr Rajapaksa won 52.25 per cent of the vote in last Saturday's election, while Mr Premadasa got 41.99 per cent, giving Mr Rajapaksa a far bigger lead than predicted by politicians and analysts. Millions voted to elect a new president to lead the country out of its deepest economic slump in over 15 years, dragged down by its tourism sector following the bombings on April 21 that killed more than 250 people. Mr Rajapaksa, 70, oversaw the military defeat of Tamil separatists under his brother and then President Mahinda Rajapaksa 10 years ago. Keep up with the latest in the region with the ST Asian Insider newsletter, delivered to your inbox every weekday By signing up, you agree to our   and  He has promised strong leadership to secure the island of 22 million people, the majority of whom are Sinhalese Buddhists. Compared with Mr Premadasa, Mr Rajapaksa and his brothers, who are expected to get key positions, are seen as being closer to China. China has invested billions of dollars building ports, expressways and power stations in the strategic Indian Ocean island nation. But these projects have also led to high debt levels for Sri Lanka. Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera and two other ministers resigned yesterday after the defeat of the ruling party's candidate in the election. Tamil political parties are strongly opposed to Mr Rajapaksa, who has faced allegations of widespread human rights violations of civilians in the final stages of the war against the separatists in 2009. Mr Rajapaksa and his brother deny the allegations. Muslims - the other large minority group - say they, too, have faced hostility since the April attacks on hotels and churches. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria claimed responsibility for the attacks. ""His victory shows a division, and this could create more issues specially for other ethnic groups. I don't know how he will tackle Muslims and Tamils,"" said Mr Victor Ivan, a political columnist. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet that he looked forward to working with Mr Rajapaksa. Sri Lanka, sitting near shipping lanes in the Indian Ocean, has become an arena of contest between regional heavyweights India and China. Beijing stepped in for post-war reconstruction after the West and India shunned the Rajapaksas because of the allegations of rights violations at the end of the civil war. Now that the family is returning to power, China will likely be the gainer, said Mr Akhil Bery of the Eurasia Group. ""We are likely to see a pivot towards China once again. China is likely very happy that Gota has won,"" he added. During the campaign, Mr Rajapaksa promised to cut the 15 per cent value-added tax by nearly half and abolish some other taxes, as a way to reignite consumption and growth. These cuts could lead to a loss of more than 600 billion rupees (S$4.5 billion) in tax revenues, Finance Ministry officials said, adding to the pressure on public finances. Mr Rajapaksa's victory margin showed huge support in the Sinhalese-dominated southern parts of the island, while Mr Premadasa, who campaigned on policies to help the poor, led in the north and east where minority Tamils are predominant. Mr Premadasa urged Mr Rajapaksa to ensure he took all Sri Lankans along and not target those who opposed him in the election. Mr Bery said: ""There is a genuine sense of fear about what a Gotabaya presidency means for minorities, and it will be up to him to show that he is indeed looking to the future and healing the wounds of the past.""","{'neg': 0.087, 'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.076, 'compound': -0.8781}",-0.8781

Mr Chia, a major in finance analytics, says: ""I was really into self-help books when I was in secondary school. These books often talked about financial success and how wealthy people became wealthy. Most pointed to either starting a business or investing. ""As a secondary school kid with little to no savings, the prospect of starting a business seemed unrealistic. Besides, I never thought I had business acumen. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  ""Investing, on the other hand, provided a more realistic proposition. I could start with a small amount and let compounding do its work for me."" He adds that he came from a low-income family, which taught him to be frugal even from a young age. His parents encouraged him to save money as a child. ""They took me to the nearest POSB bank branch to open an account. I remember I was given this kit by the bank staff that contained stickers with wise financial advice such as 'spend on needs not wants', 'track your spending', and 'save for a rainy day'. ""I stuck the stickers on my cabinet so I would be able to read them easily every day. I believe that's how I initially developed a habit of saving and living frugally."" Mr Chia recalls that the turning point came when he was in Secondary 5 in 2011 and read the book Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki. ""It changed my life and how I viewed money. It is a great primer for individuals with little to no financial literacy. The financial concepts introduced in the book were simple yet powerful."" Teammate Mr Tan, who is pursuing a bachelor's degree in business management with a major in finance analytics, says the same book inspired him and got him to learn more about investing. ""While doing national service, I spent some time to read up on equity investments,"" he recalls. ""I was excited about the prospect of making your money work for you and the power of compounding returns. When I was younger, I would often observe my mother checking stock prices on Teletext. That also contributed to my curiosity about the stock market."" He decided to save up $10,000 from his army allowance and use it to fund investments. His first step was to buy 1,000 shares of Global Logistic Properties at $1.84. The company was taken private at $3.38 in 2017, so his returns were about 83.7 per cent. ""My parents always taught me to be thrifty and to spend my money wisely. I remember being told off by my parents on my first few days in primary school for using my allowance to purchase a packet of crackers instead of a proper meal during recess,"" he says. ""It was a simple lesson like this that helped me shape my understanding of the value of money from an early age."" His schoolmate, Mr Yee, was also inspired by his parents to start investing, and his interest was piqued when he joined the investment club in university. ""I started getting interested in investing when my parents started thinking about where to put their savings to generate greater returns, apart from the usual fixed deposit in the bank,"" he says. Part of the team's strategy is to take a far-sighted view of investments for future goals, such as a house or setting up a family, rather than for short-term gains. Mr Tan says: ""I adopt a long-term view for most of the companies that I invest in. Hence, I have a buy-and-hold strategy, picking out fundamentally sound companies that pay dividends. ""These companies take up about 80 per cent of my portfolio. I also allow myself to invest in more risky counters that might yield higher returns, but I mitigate downside risks by allocating a smaller position for those investments. ""I also use any excess liquidity to trade in the short term if an opportunity presents itself."" He holds United States and Singapore equities, as well as Singapore real estate investment trusts. He also diversifies his investments so no single stock makes up more than 10 per cent of his overall portfolio. Mr Tan hopes the returns can cover the monthly cash outlay for his future home loan, plus pay out dividends for his living expenses after his retirement. Mr Chia agrees with the need to have a diverse portfolio. He holds a quarter of his investments in American-listed companies, another quarter in Singapore-listed firms, 5 per cent in Hong Kong-listed businesses, 10 per cent in gold and silver exchange-traded funds, 5 per cent in bitcoin, and the remaining 30 per cent in cash. His goal is to be a millionaire by the age of 35. ""I'm 25 now, so I still have 10 years to reach this goal. My aggregate portfolio value at the moment is approximately $250,000, so I will need my portfolio to grow by a compound annual growth rate of 15 per cent over the next decade."" He says he tends to seek out small-to mid-cap companies in the Singapore market with clear growth catalysts. ""It is a bonus if the companies have little to no analyst coverage. The time horizon for such positions tend to be between one and three years,"" he adds. He tends to seek out larger companies in the US and Hong Kong markets with a distinctive competitive advantage or economic moat and a high return on invested capital. The time horizon for such positions tends to be beyond three years. ""Generally speaking, I prefer companies in a growing market, (with a) scaleable business model, low capex (capital expenditure) intensity, high free-cash flows, founder-led, and with management holding a significant stake in the business,"" he says. Mr Yee also looks at companies with growth potential and a sustainable competitive advantage. He adds that he is attracted to firms with stable, recurring revenue and a healthy balance sheet, together with a strong management team. Their tips to other budding investors is to start early and do their research before jumping in. Mr Tan says: ""It is easy to get drawn in by the allure of making disproportionate returns with minimal capital. ""However, it is essential to fully understand the asset class that you are investing in. It takes patience, hard work and sometimes mistakes to build up the necessary knowledge and skills to be able to make accurate investment decisions."" Mr Chia adds: ""Starting early allows you to take full advantage of the power of compounding. To me, investing is a game and I enjoy playing it. I hope to play it as long as I can, and let compounding do its magic."" About 100 teams took part in Singapore's first public stock pitch challenge earlier this year, a competition aimed at nurturing budding investors across age groups and sectors. The Investor-One Challenge was initiated by Catalist-focused portal Investor-One, which is managed by ShareInvestor and supported by stock investing community InvestingNote. It spanned 31/2 months from registration in June to the final pitch event in September. ShareInvestor marketing director Agnes Lim said: ""The intention of the challenge was to bring together like-minded retail investors and provide access to listed-company C-level management (executive-level managers) to engage in face-to-face interactions via a series of activities: a corporate site visit, investor education workshops, quizzes and ultimately the finals."" The competition had six judges - one each from ShareInvestor, the Singapore Exchange, fund manager Azure Capital, financial service firm PrimePartners, corporate finance company SAC Capital and investment firm iFAST Corporation. Ms Lim said: ""Stock pitch challenges in the market are mostly either on an intra-school scale or restricted to a certain target audience. This challenge aims to close the gap and reach out to other stakeholders within the investing sphere such as retail investors, professionals and financial bloggers."" The teams picked a Catalist-listed company and started analysis. They had to justify their research reports, pitch their investing methodology and field questions from the judges. The participants also engaged with their chosen company's top managers, attended investment-literacy coaching workshops by iFAST Financial, and took quizzes that helped them to learn more about investing and the associated Catalist-listed firms. They visited pharmaceutical company Hyphens Pharma to see the facilities, attend a presentation by the chief executive and participate in a panel discussion. Ms Lim said: ""Hidden gems from the Catalist board were discovered, seasoned investors got to share their financial skills, new investors gained knowledge and Catalist-listed companies were able to put their organisations in the spotlight."" The winning team received $5,000 in cash and two runners-up walked away with $2,500 and $1,500. Doing your homework and having a diversified portfolio are some key tips from experts on how first-timers can start investing. Investing can be daunting in the beginning, but it is important that novices do their research and have their strategies mapped out, says ShareInvestor chief executive Christopher Lee, who was a judge at the recent Investor-One Challenge stock pitch competition. He adds: ""They have to ask basic questions... (such as) what they are expecting from their investments - income or capital appreciation - the time horizon and risk tolerance level. ""Also, they have to invest an amount that is meaningful. Otherwise, they may get too complacent and just park their money in the stock and hope for the best. ""The most important thing is to get their investment goals sorted out clearly and then look at the strategy to achieve those goals. I do not suggest for any novice investor to have more than 10 stocks in his portfolio at any point in time as it will require time and effort to track."" Fellow judge You Weiren, manager of stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) research at investment company iFast Corporation, adds that first-timers can also kick off with ETFs, unit trusts or managed portfolios. ""If the investor is not comfortable starting with individual stock investments, he can always start with something that is more diversified. Managed portfolios, in particular, are quite suitable for investors who are just starting out,"" he notes. ""When investors buy a managed portfolio, they are buying into a diversified portfolio of assets that gives them exposure to major markets around the world."" He adds that an ideal portfolio should have at least these two major asset classes: equities and bonds. Investors can also include alternative investments such as real estate, commodities and private equity. Mr You suggests that a guideline would be to deduct a person's age from 100 to find out the percentage he should allocate to equities in his portfolio. ""If you're 30 years old, your portfolio should have a 70 per cent allocation to equities and a 30 per cent allocation to bonds,"" he notes. ""It's not a hard and fast rule, but it's a good starting point, and if you think you can afford to take on more risk, you can adjust (the equities) to 80 per cent or maybe even 90 per cent. ""The main point is, as you age, you should allocate an increasingly higher portion of your portfolio to safer assets like bonds. For investors who want to include alternative investments in their portfolios, the percentage should be around 10 to 20 per cent.""","{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.86, 'pos': 0.119, 'compound': 0.9995}",0.9995
Alibaba shows faith in HK's future with mega $19b listing,Nov 16 2019,"HONG KONG • Alibaba Group chairman Daniel Zhang said that Hong Kong's ""future is bright"" as the company launched its US$13.86 billion (S$18.9 billion) secondary listing in the city gripped by increasingly violent protests and recession. ""Over the last few years, there have been many encouraging reforms in Hong Kong's capital market. During this time of ongoing change, we continue to believe that the future of Hong Kong remains bright,"" Mr Zhang wrote in the chairman's letter included in the company's supplementary prospectus. Four thousand people have been arrested in Hong Kong since June and the territory's economy has sunk into recession for the first time in a decade as anti-government demonstrations disrupt business and deter tourists. Alibaba priced the retail portion of its Hong Kong share sale yesterday, issuing an appeal to retail investors in Hong Kong. The largest Chinese e-commerce company capped the 12.5 million shares available to individual investors at HK$188 apiece - an auspicious number in Chinese culture - making it the most expensive first-time share sale in Hong Kong. The public offering, which began yesterday, will close at noon next Wednesday. Alibaba said that it may price the remainder of its 500 million-share offering above that ceiling, signalling that it aims to raise at least US$12 billion in what would be one of the world's largest sales of stock this year. The international offering tranche of 487.5 million shares will be set by next Wednesday after a marketing process. Asia's largest corporation is proceeding with what could be Hong Kong's biggest share sale since 2010. Slated for late this month, it will be the firm's official Asian coming-out party - half a decade after snubbing the financial hub for a record Wall Street debut. Alibaba's return hands a much-needed victory to a city wracked by protests since the summer, and will please Chinese officials who have watched many of the country's largest private corporations flock overseas for capital. If the deal goes through, Alibaba will challenge Tencent Holdings for the title of the largest Hong Kong-listed corporation. ""The listing in Hong Kong will allow more of the company's users and stakeholders in the Alibaba digital economy across Asia to invest and participate in Alibaba's growth,"" the company said. ""During this time of ongoing change, we continue to believe that the future of Hong Kong remains bright,"" Mr Zhang, who is also chief executive of Alibaba, said in a letter to investors. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steven Lam said that Alibaba's listing in Hong Kong could lead to a shake-up of the Hang Seng Index, the city's main stock benchmark. The 50-member index is heavy on financial stocks, when comparing weights with other leading equity indexes in the world. Meanwhile, IT, industrials and consumer discretionary stocks are severely underrepresented. A marquee name such as Alibaba could also draw investors and boost trading liquidity for Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, which just incurred its biggest profit slump in more than three years. For Hong Kong, it is bit of welcome news following half a year of often violent protests that have at times paralysed the city and its service industry. Efforts to court Alibaba emanated from the very top, with Chief Executive Carrie Lam herself exhorting co-founder Jack Ma to consider a listing in the city. Alibaba has considered a Hong Kong listing for a long time, Mr Michael Yao, head of corporate finance at Alibaba, said on a call with investors this week. The deal size has not changed as a result of the protests, he added. Listing closer to home has been a long-time dream of Mr Ma's. A successful Hong Kong share sale could help finance a costly war of subsidies with Meituan Dianping in food delivery and travel, and divert investor cash from rivals such as Meituan and Tencent. It will also be a feather in the cap for Mr Zhang, who took over as chairman from Mr Ma in September.","{'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.873, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': 0.9259}",0.9259
"Chan Chun Sing: Situation in Hong Kong has reached breaking point, Singapore can draw four lessons from ongoing developments",Nov 18 2019,"SINGAPORE - The situation in Hong Kong has reached a breaking point, said Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing on Monday (Nov 18) as he warned that there would be grave doubts about the Chinese territory's future and the sustainability of its political system if calm is not restored through dialogue.Tham Yuen-C ""We watch with concern, the deterioration of the situation in Hong Kong. This is especially so for those of us with relatives in Hong Kong,"" he told reporters following one of the most violent weeks of clashes between pro-democracy protesters and police that has left much of the city paralysed. ""Hong Kong's continued success as an economic and financial hub is important for the region and the world, including Singapore,"" Mr Chan said. The months-long protests have entered a new phase  . On Monday, hundreds of protesters remained locked in a stand-off at Hong Kong Polytechnic University with the police. As protesters threw petrol bombs and catapulted bricks, riot police fired back with tear gas and water cannon. Mr Chan, speaking to reporters at his office at The Treasury, said many Singaporeans have asked if the same could happen here. He added: ""My intent today is not to pass judgment on others. But to draw lessons for ourselves. Now what has happened to Hong Kong can easily happen to Singapore if we are complacent or not careful."" Elaborating, he said developments in Hong Kong have highlighted the importance of a well-functioning political system and healthy political culture, as well as of long-term policies and social cohesion, and the need for small states to stay relevant. On political culture, Mr Chan said that while political systems need to represent the diverse interests of people, what is more important is to find ways for these different interests to co-exist. He cautioned that contestation and debate in the absence of concrete and constructive actions will not deliver solutions. Political systems dominated by parties that only champion narrow, sectoral interests without consideration for the greater good are also not sustainable, he added. He emphasised the need for political leaders to work closely with the public service to ensure policies are executed properly, and the importance of feedback channels so governments can respond and adjust policies when necessary. In Singapore, for instance, agencies and organisations such as the People's Association, NTUC and feedback unit Reach have helped the Government understand the fears, concerns and aspirations of the people, he said. ""Regardless of political systems and party interests, the exercise of leadership must be to put people's and countries' interest foremost, and in our case, what this government commits to it will deliver. It is our promise to our people in this generation, and the next,"" he added. The situation in Hong Kong has also shown up the drawbacks of focusing too much on immediate issues instead of long-term policymaking, he said. ""All elections, cannot be just about the here and now, without consideration for the long term future of our people and country,"" added Mr Chan. To illustrate his point, he cited the example of how the Government has prioritised national development, especially public housing. Pointing to suggestions that the Government should use proceeds from land sales to finance its current spending, Mr Chan said: ""We are careful to not distort incentives for government to use land sales to maximise profits. Otherwise, it is the public that will ultimately pay."" ""We are also careful to not let private developers' interest override wider public interest. Revenue from long-term land sales goes into our reserves to benefit future generations. This is the discipline we adhere to. This is the promise we make to future generations."" All land sale proceeds in Singapore go to the national reserves. At the 2018 Budget debate, Workers' Party leader Pritam Singh  , instead of raising the Goods and Services Tax. ""The ability to access affordable housing and essential services is fundamental to keeping society stable. The transfer of land ownership and properties across generations cannot be at the expense of depriving future generation of opportunities to be rewarded based on hard work and capabilities. It cannot be that those who are rich first will be rich forever without due effort,"" said Mr Chan on Monday. The minister also spoke about the importance of maintaining social cohesion while catering to the diverse needs and interests of different groups. He urged all parties to think of the wider good of the country even as they champion the needs and wants of specific communities, and stressed that conflicts can only be resolved through dialogue and constructive actions and not violence. ""To insist on maximum individual gains at the expense of the common and collective good cannot be the Singapore way. The pursuit of such narrow interests will instead fracture the political centre for compromise and constructive solutioning,"" said Mr Chan. ""Conflict resolution is not about telling the government what we want, and have others solve the problem for us. It is about all of us coming together to tackle the issues together. This is the true meaning of the democracy of deeds,"" he added. A ""democracy of deeds"" was Old Guard member S.Rajaratnam's vision for Singapore, where people step up to solve problems instead of opposing simply for the sake of opposing, and Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat recently cited the term in outlining the fourth-generation PAP leadership's approach to governing. Ultimately, said Mr Chan, Singaporeans are responsible for the country's future. ""Regardless of what others say, we must bear the responsibilities and consequences of our own choices and actions. This is why we are against foreign interference in domestic politics,"" he added. Lastly, he said, Hong Kong's experience also raises the issue of how small city-states must remain relevant in a turbulent world. History has shown that city-states that could not provide oppotunities and hope for their people and did not remain relevant to the world have never lasted long, he said. ""Singapore will have to pick up the pieces ourselves should things go bad or go wrong,"" he added. ""Singapore's continue relevance to the world is never a given. We must work hard, distinguish ourselves and stay exceptional amidst the global uncertainties."" This can be done by growing the opportunities for our enterprises and workers and maintaining a principled perspective on regional and global affairs, for instance, he said. He called on Singaporeans to remain united and cohesive and adding that Singapore should chart its own path.","{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.123, 'compound': 0.9973}",0.9973
Alibaba calls off event for mega HK IPO amid unrest,Nov 18 2019,"HONG KONG • Alibaba Group Holding called off plans for an investor luncheon in Hong Kong for its secondary listing amid intensifying protests in the city, according to sources. The Chinese e-commerce giant is conducting investor meetings by phone rather than in person for its planned new share sale, citing logistics and safety concerns, said one of the sources, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Months of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong have closed the city's airport at least twice, while its transit system is increasingly facing disrupted service. Citigroup, one of the underwriters on Alibaba's offering, warned staff to steer clear of dangerous places after one of its bankers was arrested in the financial district last week. Companies that go public in Hong Kong typically arrange a luncheon with institutional investors on the day book-building commences. A representative for Alibaba declined to comment on the roadshow schedule. Alibaba's planned offering size has not changed as a result of the protests, Mr Michael Yao, the company's head of corporate finance, said on a conference call with investors last week. Order books for its US$13.4 billion (S$18.2 billion) Hong Kong share sale have already been covered ""multiple times"", sources with direct knowledge of the matter said last Friday, as the e-commerce group kicked off its campaign for the secondary listing. The sources said potential investors had been told that the ""quality of demand is high"" and that there ""continues to be very strong feedback"" about the deal. Pricing of the shares for institutional shareholders will be set on Wednesday, a prospectus lodged with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange shows. Retail investors will not pay more than HK$188 per share, an auspicious number in Chinese culture. 
  In a first for the Asian financial hub, Alibaba said the initial public offering (IPO) would be fully automated and paperless to reflect its environmental standards. Investment bankers familiar with the listing, however, said the move avoided a potential publicity nightmare of investors queueing at banks to place stock orders while protests raged around them. The share sale is set to be Hong Kong's largest in more than nine years, and comes as Beijing seeks support from the semi-autonomous territory's tycoons and entrepreneurs to maintain a sense of business-as-usual in the face of more than five months of unrest. Alibaba had originally considered a Hong Kong IPO in 2013, but ultimately chose New York for its primary listing after failing to gain approval from Hong Kong regulators for its unusual governance structure.","{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.888, 'pos': 0.064, 'compound': 0.7265}",0.7265
"Pushing ahead with productivity, innovation and internationalisation amid tough economic climate",Nov 18 2019,"Local bus manufacturer SC Auto, which embarked on a transformation journey five years ago, reached a major milestone last month when its SC Neustar buses started running on the roads in Myanmar.Choo Yun Ting This came just 10 months after the launch of the first bus to be completely built and designed in Singapore last December. SC Auto chairman Tan Siow Chua told The Straits Times that its overseas ambitions drove it to shift from making bus parts to manufacturing its own buses. ""If we didn't change our business strategy, we would be able to operate only in Singapore, and expanding overseas would be dependent on others wanting to partner with us. But by developing our own buses, we have more freedom in deciding which markets we want to expand to,"" he said. Mr Tan started the business in 1978 with a single bus, transporting students and factory workers. In 1992, he expanded into designing and building buses, partnering global vehicle manufacturers such as Volvo and Isuzu, before incorporating SC Auto four years later as the company started to focus on bus manufacturing. In 2014, SC Auto began building its own brand of buses. The end result: SC Neustar. It is about 1 tonne lighter than the average passenger bus, resulting in 3 per cent to 4 per cent fuel savings, despite having a luggage compartment that is about 15 per cent larger than its rivals', Mr Tan said. Five years and $60 million into its journey, SC Auto, which has about 150 employees, now has the ability to deliver around 900 buses a year from its factories in Senoko and Yangon, Myanmar. As it went regional, it also automated the production processes at its Myanmar plant with the adoption of precision laser tube-cutting systems, which have raised productivity by up to 40 per cent. Mr Tan said assistance from government agency Enterprise Singapore (ESG) helped SC Auto embark on its research and development (R&D) efforts. The agency provides support for companies across industries to boost productivity, embrace innovation and internationalise their operations. ESG chief executive Png Cheong Boon said that even amid a slowdown in the economy, businesses must continue to focus on positioning themselves for the future by putting in place plans for automation and digitalisation, while investing in skills training for their workers. SC Auto's experience holds lessons for businesses looking at new ways to do things or develop new products and services to differentiate themselves. This would allow them to compete based on their innovative edge rather than cost, which is not tenable in today's economy, Mr Png said. This sentiment was shared by Mr Tan, who said it is impossible for a company in Singapore to compete with firms in the region on cost due to high labour costs here. SC Auto's next phase of innovation focuses on a new three-axle vehicle which is larger and more stable than its existing offerings. This new vehicle, which is in the R&D phase, will be produced in Myanmar and is targeted at the South-east Asia market, Mr Tan said. For businesses earlier in their transformation journey, Mr Png said they can strengthen their fundamentals by improving productivity through digitalisation and automation, instead of relying on manual processes and systems. Local eatery Koon Bak Kut Teh, which started as a hawker stall in 2005 before opening its first restaurant in 2012, upgraded its point-of-sale system, as well as its dish-washing equipment and combination ovens earlier this year. Mr Chong Nyen Koon, founder and director of Koon, said the eatery is able to manage its manpower more effectively now. ""Staff said the new systems have made their lives easier as several tasks have become simpler, with less mundane and repetitive steps,"" he said. The company was given advice on how to improve its productivity at an SME Centre, where small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) receive free one-on-one advice. Koon applied for several grants, which spurred its productivity push. However, this transformation came with its challenges, Mr Chong said, citing significant costs despite receiving subsidies and grants, as systems required upgrading and staff had to be trained to implement the changes. ""It was also not easy to get employees who were used to the old systems to accept the changes,"" Mr Chong said. But the efforts have paid off as the eatery has boosted its productivity levels, he added. Adapting to technology was no issue for medtech start-up KroniKare. Its challenge was finding the right market. Singapore's small market means that companies should look beyond its shores and diversify the markets they go into, Mr Png said. With its networks and connections in foreign markets, ESG has been key in helping local companies establish themselves abroad. For KroniKare, ESG helped introduce the company's artificial intelligence-based wound scanner to India's massive market. KroniKare co-founder Ali Y. Aladdin said: ""ESG has been key in helping us jump-start our operations overseas, and having ESG introduce us to (hospitals, governments and other stakeholders) gives us credibility."" In October last year, KroniKare participated in a trip to India and connected with Apollo Hospitals, a leading private hospital group in India. In April this year, KroniKare signed an agreement with Apollo which will pave the way for clinical trials. KroniKare is also leveraging ESG's connections to set up an office in the Netherlands. The company's presence there is key to its ambitions in Europe, despite already having an office in Britain, given the Brexit situation, Mr Aladdin said. Mr Kurt Wee, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, said ESG has helped boost the SME ecosystem in Singapore. ""ESG has been crucial in supporting SMEs in their market search and business matching abroad, even up till their first or second year overseas,"" he added. Mr Png said that while venturing abroad comes with challenges and risks, offerings from Singapore companies are in demand overseas, and ESG is committed to helping firms capitalise on these opportunities to expand overseas. ""For those who have already internationalised, we will continue to work with them to expand their global footprint, especially since diversification can help lower market-specific risks,"" he added. Enterprise Singapore (ESG) chief executive Png Cheong Boon said it is important for companies to embrace change amid the tough economic climate. They can start with workforce transformation: Redesigning job roles or implementing on-the-job training to help workers keep pace with new technologies, and redeploying workers from roles which are no longer relevant to other roles as businesses diversify or transform. ESG has streamlined several schemes to make them more flexible and increased the quantum of support to better cater to the different needs of companies. Last year, the Capability Development Grant and the Global Company Partnership Grant were combined into the Enterprise Development Grant. Last month, several financing schemes were brought under one umbrella - the Enterprise Financing Scheme - to help firms access financing more readily throughout their growth stages. Firms can also work with any of ESG's 10 Centres of Innovation. They provide technical expertise and equipment to co-develop products and services, to speed up the commercialisation of new technologies. ESG and its partners provide several tools to help companies take the first step to increasing their productivity. These partners include trade associations and chambers, SME Centres, Centres of Innovation, institutes of higher learning and other government agencies. Tools include: • Business advisers from SME Centres who have been specially trained to support heartland and small enterprises on their digitalisation journeys. • The Start Digital programme, which allows companies to adopt digital tools in payroll, marketing and accounting at no cost for at least six months if they sign on for a package with ESG's partners. This enables firms to put in place basic digital tools. • High-growth companies can also participate in ESG's Scale-up SG programme to develop their expansion strategies with consultants and engage in peer learning or networking opportunities. More information can be accessed at  KroniKare's wound scanner, a patented diagnostic tool for artificial intelligence-based chronic wound assessment, went on trial at Changi General Hospital and was deployed in St Andrew's Community Hospital. It reduces the time required to assess a wound from 30 minutes to 30 seconds. The scanner is able to assess a wide variety of wounds, from ulcers to those caused by accidents, and can detect infection and blood circulation problems as well. It also replaces people required to manually assess the wound, a process which can be invasive and error-prone.

"While You Were Sleeping: 5 stories you might have missed, Nov 18",Nov 18 2019,"Hong Kong police threatened on Monday to fire live bullets if “rioters” did not stop using lethal weapons in the latest flare up in anti-government protests that have convulsed the Chinese-ruled city for five months. The police statement followed fresh clashes outside a university in the centre of Hong Kong where protesters were hunkered down behind makeshift shields and hurled petrol bombs at police in a standoff blocking a vital tunnel link. Police had said on Sunday one officer had been treated in hospital after being hit in the leg by an arrow and another had his visor struck by a metal ball, although he was not hurt. In Monday's statement, police warned people who they described as rioters to stop using lethal weapons to attack officers and to halt other acts of violence, saying office would respond with force and possibly live bullets if necessary. Britain's Prince Andrew provoked a backlash Sunday following an extraordinary TV interview branded ""disastrous"" by public relations experts in which he denied having sex with an alleged victim of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The royal was lambasted from all quarters for his lack of judgement and empathy with Epstein's victims, while his eyebrow-raising defence that he was at a high street pizza chain, never sweated and only stayed at the disgraced financier's home because he was ""honourable"" drew derision. The unprecedented interview was the first time Queen Elizabeth II's second son has answered questions from the media about Virginia Robert's allegations. HP Inc said on Sunday it had rejected an offer from printer maker Xerox Corp to buy the company, saying the US$33.5 billion (S$45.5 billion) cash-and-stock proposal ""significantly undervalues"" the personal computer maker. However, the company also said it remained open to a potential merger with Xerox and that it hoped for further engagement with Xerox management about the merits of a potential deal. The offer would have resulted in HP shareholders owning about 48% of the combined company.

Malaysia stocks get cheaper by the day but few want to buy them,Nov 18 2019,"SINGAPORE () - Asia's worst-performing major stock market is getting cheaper by the day. But that's not enough to lure investors back. Malaysian equities aren't ripe for a re-rating even as valuations drop to near the lowest in a decade, according to investors. Political risks and a weak earnings outlook have undercut appetite for local shares, which are heading toward a second year of losses, extending 2018's worst showing since the global financial crisis. ""Malaysia remains an perennial underweight position for foreign investors,"" said Michiel van Voorst, chief investment officer for Asian equities at UBP Asset Management Asia. Local stocks have fallen substantially ""but valuation without a catalyst is not enough. The profit cycle needs to improve on an incremental basis."" Global funds have yanked more than US$2 billion (S$2.7 billion) from Malaysian stocks in 2019, the biggest outflow among emerging Asian equity markets. More than a year after   pledging to boost the stock market, investors have been left underwhelmed by a cut in public spending, a lackluster ringgit and question marks over the succession of power. The FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index's 12-month forward earnings estimate has declined more than 12 per cent since the Pakatan Harapan coalition assumed power in May 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Business sentiment took a beating after the government shelved several large infrastructure projects and slashed spending to rein in its debt. The share index's price-to-book valuation of 1.5 times is near the lowest since 2009 and at a discount to the 10-year average. The market is 4 per cent away from bear market levels. To be sure, public finances may get a boost after Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng loosened the purse strings for next year's budget and the authorities stepped up efforts to recoup billions of dollars lost in the 1MDB scandal. The efforts are not lost on investors. UBS Global Wealth Management remains overweight on Malaysian equities in its tactical asset allocation in Asia, according to equity strategist Lee Wen Ching who expects a potential improvement in earnings to boost stock prices. But most money managers remain focused on the growth outlook, especially amid uncertainties about when -- and who -- will eventually succeed the 94-year old Mahathir. Speculation about Mahathir's intention to honor a pledge to hand over to Anwar Ibrahim has dogged markets, with Minister of Economic Affairs Azmin Ali and Mukhriz Mahathir, the prime minister's son, said to be in the running for the role as well. ""The uncertainty on who will be the next prime minister and the little progress on government policy side doesn't make Malaysia stand out among other countries,"" said Ang Kok Heng, chief investment officer at Phillip Capital Management in Kuala Lumpur. Sentiment toward Malaysian stocks has also been hurt by the weakening macro data. The economy expanded 4.4 per cent last quarter, the slowest pace in a year, while exports recorded the biggest slump since 2016 in September. Global funds are on guard after FTSE Russell said it may drop Malaysia from its World Government Bond Index. The central bank has rolled out a series of initiatives to deepen onshore markets and the index provider is expected to provide its next update in March. The benchmark equities gauge has fallen 14 per cent since May 2018 as investors await the outcome of government reforms in the electricity, telecommunication and construction sectors. The index slumped 5.9 per cent last year, its biggest annual decline in a decade.","{'neg': 0.104, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': 0.2923}",0.2923
"Tiong Seng snags $125m in green loan facilities from OCBC, DBS",Nov 18 2019,"SINGAPORE - Construction firm Tiong Seng Holdings on Monday (Nov 18) said it has secured $125 million worth of green loan and environmental performance-linked facilities from OCBC Bank and DBS Bank respectively. Of that amount, $70 million - which is a green loan - will be exclusively used on green projects, the group said in a regulatory filing. The green loan will be used to finance construction projects with ""clear environmental benefits"", such as certified green buildings and projects which improve resource efficiency and generate renewable energy. Mainboard-listed Tiong Seng added that it has set up a green loan framework guided by the green loan principles from the Loan Market Association to guide the allocation and management of proceeds from the green loan. Meanwhile, $55 million in environmental performance-linked facilities was signed with DBS Bank to refinance some of its existing loans as well as for general corporate purposes. With the facilities, Tiong Seng will be eligible for interest rate and performance bond commission discounts, if agreed performance targets are met or exceeded. These targets will be based on a review and validation led by an external independent party at the end of each one-year period, the group said. ""Apart from diversifying our sources of funding, these facilities will allow us to focus on our environmental and green objectives to make a positive difference in our society,"" Tiong Seng Holdings chief executive Pek Lian Guan said.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.869, 'pos': 0.131, 'compound': 0.9808}",0.9808
RCEP provides an opportunity to shape the region: SM Teo Chee Hean,Nov 17 2019,"The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement is not just an ""arithmetical game"" about benefits that countries can get, but an opportunity to shape the norms and attitudes of a large region in the world, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean said yesterday.Seow Bei Yi Countries like India must not live just in the moment, but look to where they want to be in 10 to 15 years, he added at the fourth South Asian Diaspora Convention held at the National University of Singapore's University Cultural Centre. ""It would be a lost opportunity not to grasp it, not from the bean-counting point of view, but from an overall strategic point of view,"" said Mr Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security, in response to a question from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank's director-general of investment operations, Mr Pang Yee Ean, who asked about the significance of  . The RCEP, which now includes 15 member countries, including all Asean nations, and accounts for nearly 30 per cent of the share of the world's gross domestic product (GDP), is widely anticipated to further heighten this region's critical role in global value chains. But India announced earlier this month that it would stay out of the mega-pact, amid concerns that it would hurt domestic producers. In his address at the event organised by the Institute of South Asian Studies, Mr Teo expressed hope that the countries can overcome their outstanding issues so that India can come on board eventually. ""We look forward to the region, including India, moving ahead together as one,"" he said. He also outlined three ways that the South Asian diaspora can help their region. First, by boosting economic cooperation within it, as well as with other regions. There remains scope for South Asia to exploit such potential, given that international trade makes up a relatively low share of GDP in South Asian countries, with merchandise exports accounting for less than 10 per cent of GDP in South Asia. The figure is over 20 per cent in East Asia and the Pacific, and 30 per cent in Europe and Central Asia, said Mr Teo. Intra-regional trade accounts for just 5 per cent of South Asia's total trade, compared with 24 per cent in Asean in 2015. ""Regional integration has been a powerful force for growth,"" Mr Teo added, citing how South-east Asian countries managed to set aside significant bilateral differences to focus on development. Apart from boosting economic links, the diaspora can also work to strengthen South Asia's connectivity, such as via infrastructure development, as well as by developing talent, said Mr Teo. An Asian Development Bank study showed that the region needs an average investment of about US$365 billion ($496 billion) each year to meet its infrastructure needs between 2016 and 2030. ""We know that infrastructure projects require a lot of investment, a high cost, and it is often not possible for South Asian governments to finance these projects on their own,"" Mr Teo said in his speech, adding that governments could tap capital from the private sector and multilateral institutions to plug the gap.","{'neg': 0.033, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.119, 'compound': 0.9923}",0.9923

Sri Lanka election body declares Gotabaya Rajapaksa winner of presidential poll,Nov 17 2019,"COLOMBO () – Sri Lanka's election commission declared former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa as the winner of the presidential election on Sunday (Nov 17).  Rajapaksa won 52.25 per cent of the votes, while his main rival and government minister Sajith Premadasa received 41.99 per cent, the election commission said.  Premadasa had already conceded defeat. Rajapaksa oversaw the military defeat of Tamil separatists under his brother and then president Mahinda Rajapaksa 10 years ago. He has promised strong leadership to secure the island of 22 million people, the majority of whom are Sinhalese Buddhists. Rajapaksa, 70, would be the latest nationalist leader swept to power across the world, tapping into the anger and fears of majority communities. He and his brothers, who are expected to get key positions, are also seen as closer to China, which has invested billions of dollars building ports, expressways and power stations. But these projects have also led to high debt levels for Sri Lanka. In his first comments, Rajapaksa struck a conciliatory note, suggesting he would be a leader of all Sri Lankans, regardless of their ethnic and religious identities.  “As we usher in a new journey for Sri Lanka, we must remember that all Sri Lankans are part of this journey. Let us rejoice peacefully, with dignity and discipline in the same manner in which we campaigned,” Rajapaksa said in a tweet. Tamil political parties are strongly opposed to Rajapaksa, who has faced allegations of widespread human rights violations of civilians in the final stages of the war against the separatists in 2009. Rajapaksa and his brother deny the allegations. Muslims, the other large minority group, say they too have faced hostility since the April attacks on hotels and churches in which more than 250 people were killed. Islamic State claimed responsibility. With half the votes counted from Saturday's election, Rajapaksa led with 50.7 per cent, while his main rival Sajith Premadasa had 43.8 per cent, the election commission said. PREMADASA CONCEDES DEFEAT  Premadasa, a housing minister in the current government that has faced criticism for failing to protect Sri Lankans in the wake of the suicide bombings in April, conceded defeat. “At the conclusion of a hard fought and spirited election campaign, It is my privilege to honour the decision of the people and congratulate Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa on his election as the seventh President of Sri Lanka,” Premadasa said. Millions voted to elect a new president to lead the country out of its deepest economic slump in over 15 years, dragged down by its tourism sector following the bombings. 
His victory margin showed huge support in the Sinhalese-dominated southern parts of the island. Premadasa, who campaigned on policies to help the poor, led in the north and east where minority Tamils are predominant. 
He urged Rajapaksa to ensure he took all Sri Lankans along and not target those who opposed him in the election. “I also urge Mr. Rajapaksa to ensure that the post-election environment is peaceful, and that no citizen or New Democratic Party supporter is persecuted or harmed for their role in supporting my candidacy,” he said, referring to his party. Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya said the voter turnout across the island could be as much as 84 per cent. Gunmen opened fire and pelted stones at a convoy of about 20 buses transporting ""hundreds"" of Muslim voters in north-west Sri Lanka in the early hours of Saturday, said Mr Manjula Gajanayake, national coordinator for the privately run Centre for Monitoring Election Violence. ""The reason for the shooting incident is definitely political elements trying to prevent voting,"" Mr Gajanayake said, adding that the victims, who escaped unhurt, had been able to exercise their franchise. The winner of Sri Lanka's election will inherit a country with an economy where growth has slowed to a more than five-year low of 1.6 per cent in the quarter ended June, and which has a debt level hovering at 83 per cent of gross domestic product. ""If Gotabhaya wins he will improve the country,"" said Ms Manel Perera, 68, a housewife in the Kotte area of the capital. ""Otherwise the country will go down further."" Mr Rajive Premathilake, 54, a business executive who said he voted for Mr Premadasa, said the next government needs to ensure ""democracy, freedom and civil liberties while getting the economy going. It can't be one at the expense of the other"". Investors had taken a wait-and-see approach ahead of the elections, said Mr Adrian Perera, chief operating officer at Equicapital Investments in Colombo. The benchmark stock index has risen 16 per cent in the past six months, making it one of the 10 best-performing equity markets globally.","{'neg': 0.099, 'neu': 0.789, 'pos': 0.112, 'compound': 0.8482}",0.8482

Alibaba said it may price the remainder of its 500 million-share offering above that ceiling, signaling that it aims to raise at least US$12 billion (S$16.3 billion), the biggest first-time share sale in Hong Kong this year.","{'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.901, 'pos': 0.061, 'compound': 0.5267}",0.5267

Singapore Customs opens ops building in Jurong West,Nov 16 2019,"The Singapore Customs operations building officially opened in Bulim Drive in Jurong West yesterday, relocating from its Keppel Road premises after close to 80 years.Jean Iau The new building uses modern facilities to support the Singapore Customs' enforcement operations as well as the training and development of its officers. It will also allow for intelligence, investigation and compliance-related functions to come under one roof, Singapore Customs said. The need to find a replacement facility came after Customs was informed in 2009 that its Keppel Road site had been earmarked for redevelopment, the authority said in a release. The Keppel Road building was built in 1940 and originally designed to provide office space for Customs staff working in the sea ports, and had served as staff quarters. The building was later repurposed as a base for enforcement operations from the 1960s. The department's role is to ensure a fair and competitive playing field for traders, while also protecting the Government's revenue by taking enforcement action against those who attempt to evade duties and taxes through fraudulent declarations or the bringing in of contraband goods. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Minister for National Development and Second Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong said that amid increasing pressures of protectionism and nationalism working against free trade, the Customs authorities across the world must pursue trade facilitative measures to promote the seamless flow of goods across borders.

Severe $22 trillion pension crisis awaits worldwide: G-30,Nov 16 2019,"WASHINGTON • The United States, China and other leading economies confront a massive funding gap of US$15.8 trillion (S$21.5 trillion) in 2050 to ensure lifetime financial support for their ageing populations. This is based on a report spearheaded by former chairman of Britain's Financial Services Authority Adair Turner for the prestigious Group of 30 (G-30), comprising current and former policymakers. ""If public policies and individual behaviours do not change, many countries' pension systems will face a severe crisis, threatening either unaffordable public expenditure pressures or inadequate incomes for retirees,"" said Mr Turner. The projected US$15.8 trillion shortfall is adjusted for inflation so the actual nominal dollar amount in 2050 will be materially larger, equivalent to 23 per cent of global gross domestic product that year, according to the 75-page report. The G-30 mainly blamed antiquated pension and retirement systems for the yawning financing gap, which it pegged at US$1.2 trillion last year. Smaller projected returns on savings in an era of low interest rates aggravate the problem. The report - which covers 21 countries, including Japan, Germany and Mexico, accounting for 90 per cent of global GDP - said the coming crisis is not just about pensions. Lifetime financial security also depends on the availability of public health, housing and transportation services, as well as on informal community and family support. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  The G-30 advocated a mixture of policies to tackle the problem: • Increasing the official retirement age by at least four to six years by 2050, enabling people to work longer. A quarter of the funding gap could be closed if retirees on average worked 20 per cent of the time of standard-aged workers. • Promoting higher savings by individuals and increasing taxes to support public pensions. Such steps might include mandatory savings programmes. • Accepting that expected incomes in retirement may need to be lower. For middle-and high-income retirees, that might mean living on 60 per cent of average pre-retirement incomes, rather than 75 per cent. The report's working group also called for action to reduce the administration and asset management costs borne by people saving for retirement. That might include establishing national utilities to provide bulk processing and purchasing of asset management services. ","{'neg': 0.096, 'neu': 0.819, 'pos': 0.086, 'compound': -0.7964}",-0.7964

Investor challenge winners share their tips and tricks,Nov 16 2019,"Investing early and holding on for the long term are the winning strategies of a team of students from the Singapore Management University, who bagged the top prize at this year's Investor-One Challenge.Sue-Ann Tan The team - Mr Yee Jin Koi, 22, Mr Kenny Chia, 25, and Mr Bryan Tan, 23 - won the stock pitch challenge against some 100 other teams of contestants by presenting their investment case for pharmaceutical company Hyphens Pharma. They backed buying the company's stock because of factors such as rising consumer healthcare spending, demands from an ageing population and the potential dividends from the firm's investment in dermatologicals. They also analysed the company's business model and its management. Their sharp analysis won them a cash prize of $5,000. All three team members said their investment journeys began early on in life. Mr Chia, a major in finance analytics, says: ""I was really into self-help books when I was in secondary school. These books often talked about financial success and how wealthy people became wealthy. Most pointed to either starting a business or investing. ""As a secondary school kid with little to no savings, the prospect of starting a business seemed unrealistic. Besides, I never thought I had business acumen. ""Investing, on the other hand, provided a more realistic proposition. I could start with a small amount and let compounding do its work for me."" He adds that he came from a low-income family, which taught him to be frugal even from a young age. His parents encouraged him to save money as a child. ""They took me to the nearest POSB bank branch to open an account. I remember I was given this kit by the bank staff that contained stickers with wise financial advice such as 'spend on needs not wants', 'track your spending', and 'save for a rainy day'. ""I stuck the stickers on my cabinet so I would be able to read them easily every day. I believe that's how I initially developed a habit of saving and living frugally."" Mr Chia recalls that the turning point came when he was in Secondary 5 in 2011 and read the book Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki. ""It changed my life and how I viewed money. It is a great primer for individuals with little to no financial literacy. The financial concepts introduced in the book were simple yet powerful."" Teammate Mr Tan, who is pursuing a bachelor's degree in business management with a major in finance analytics, says the same book inspired him and got him to learn more about investing. ""While doing national service, I spent some time to read up on equity investments,"" he recalls. ""I was excited about the prospect of making your money work for you and the power of compounding returns. When I was younger, I would often observe my mother checking stock prices on Teletext. That also contributed to my curiosity about the stock market."" He decided to save up $10,000 from his army allowance and use it to fund investments. His first step was to buy 1,000 shares of Global Logistic Properties at $1.84. The company was taken private at $3.38 in 2017, so his returns were about 83.7 per cent. ""My parents always taught me to be thrifty and to spend my money wisely. I remember being told off by my parents on my first few days in primary school for using my allowance to purchase a packet of crackers instead of a proper meal during recess,"" he says. ""It was a simple lesson like this that helped me shape my understanding of the value of money from an early age."" His schoolmate, Mr Yee, was also inspired by his parents to start investing, and his interest was piqued when he joined the investment club in university. ""I started getting interested in investing when my parents started thinking about where to put their savings to generate greater returns, apart from the usual fixed deposit in the bank,"" he says. Part of the team's strategy is to take a far-sighted view of investments for future goals, such as a house or setting up a family, rather than for short-term gains. Mr Tan says: ""I adopt a long-term view for most of the companies that I invest in. Hence, I have a buy-and-hold strategy, picking out fundamentally sound companies that pay dividends. ""These companies take up about 80 per cent of my portfolio. I also allow myself to invest in more risky counters that might yield higher returns, but I mitigate downside risks by allocating a smaller position for those investments. ""I also use any excess liquidity to trade in the short term if an opportunity presents itself."" He holds United States and Singapore equities, as well as Singapore real estate investment trusts. He also diversifies his investments so no single stock makes up more than 10 per cent of his overall portfolio. Mr Tan hopes the returns can cover the monthly cash outlay for his future home loan, plus pay out dividends for his living expenses after his retirement. Mr Chia agrees with the need to have a diverse portfolio. He holds a quarter of his investments in American-listed companies, another quarter in Singapore-listed firms, 5 per cent in Hong Kong-listed businesses, 10 per cent in gold and silver exchange-traded funds, 5 per cent in bitcoin, and the remaining 30 per cent in cash. His goal is to be a millionaire by the age of 35. ""I'm 25 now, so I still have 10 years to reach this goal. My aggregate portfolio value at the moment is approximately $250,000, so I will need my portfolio to grow by a compound annual growth rate of 15 per cent over the next decade."" He says he tends to seek out small-to mid-cap companies in the Singapore market with clear growth catalysts. ""It is a bonus if the companies have little to no analyst coverage. The time horizon for such positions tend to be between one and three years,"" he adds. He tends to seek out larger companies in the US and Hong Kong markets with a distinctive competitive advantage or economic moat and a high return on invested capital. The time horizon for such positions tends to be beyond three years. ""Generally speaking, I prefer companies in a growing market, (with a) scaleable business model, low capex (capital expenditure) intensity, high free-cash flows, founder-led, and with management holding a significant stake in the business,"" he says. Mr Yee also looks at companies with growth potential and a sustainable competitive advantage. He adds that he is attracted to firms with stable, recurring revenue and a healthy balance sheet, together with a strong management team. Their tips to other budding investors is to start early and do their research before jumping in. Mr Tan says: ""It is easy to get drawn in by the allure of making disproportionate returns with minimal capital. ""However, it is essential to fully understand the asset class that you are investing in. It takes patience, hard work and sometimes mistakes to build up the necessary knowledge and skills to be able to make accurate investment decisions."" Mr Chia adds: ""Starting early allows you to take full advantage of the power of compounding. To me, investing is a game and I enjoy playing it. I hope to play it as long as I can, and let compounding do its magic."" About 100 teams took part in Singapore's first public stock pitch challenge earlier this year, a competition aimed at nurturing budding investors across age groups and sectors. The Investor-One Challenge was initiated by Catalist-focused portal Investor-One, which is managed by ShareInvestor and supported by stock investing community InvestingNote. It spanned 31/2 months from registration in June to the final pitch event in September. ShareInvestor marketing director Agnes Lim said: ""The intention of the challenge was to bring together like-minded retail investors and provide access to listed-company C-level management (executive-level managers) to engage in face-to-face interactions via a series of activities: a corporate site visit, investor education workshops, quizzes and ultimately the finals."" The competition had six judges - one each from ShareInvestor, the Singapore Exchange, fund manager Azure Capital, financial service firm PrimePartners, corporate finance company SAC Capital and investment firm iFAST Corporation. Ms Lim said: ""Stock pitch challenges in the market are mostly either on an intra-school scale or restricted to a certain target audience. This challenge aims to close the gap and reach out to other stakeholders within the investing sphere such as retail investors, professionals and financial bloggers."" The teams picked a Catalist-listed company and started analysis. They had to justify their research reports, pitch their investing methodology and field questions from the judges. The participants also engaged with their chosen company's top managers, attended investment-literacy coaching workshops by iFAST Financial, and took quizzes that helped them to learn more about investing and the associated Catalist-listed firms. They visited pharmaceutical company Hyphens Pharma to see the facilities, attend a presentation by the chief executive and participate in a panel discussion. Ms Lim said: ""Hidden gems from the Catalist board were discovered, seasoned investors got to share their financial skills, new investors gained knowledge and Catalist-listed companies were able to put their organisations in the spotlight."" The winning team received $5,000 in cash and two runners-up walked away with $2,500 and $1,500. Doing your homework and having a diversified portfolio are some key tips from experts on how first-timers can start investing. Investing can be daunting in the beginning, but it is important that novices do their research and have their strategies mapped out, says ShareInvestor chief executive Christopher Lee, who was a judge at the recent Investor-One Challenge stock pitch competition. He adds: ""They have to ask basic questions... (such as) what they are expecting from their investments - income or capital appreciation - the time horizon and risk tolerance level. ""Also, they have to invest an amount that is meaningful. Otherwise, they may get too complacent and just park their money in the stock and hope for the best. ""The most important thing is to get their investment goals sorted out clearly and then look at the strategy to achieve those goals. I do not suggest for any novice investor to have more than 10 stocks in his portfolio at any point in time as it will require time and effort to track."" Fellow judge You Weiren, manager of stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) research at investment company iFast Corporation, adds that first-timers can also kick off with ETFs, unit trusts or managed portfolios. ""If the investor is not comfortable starting with individual stock investments, he can always start with something that is more diversified. Managed portfolios, in particular, are quite suitable for investors who are just starting out,"" he notes. ""When investors buy a managed portfolio, they are buying into a diversified portfolio of assets that gives them exposure to major markets around the world."" He adds that an ideal portfolio should have at least these two major asset classes: equities and bonds. Investors can also include alternative investments such as real estate, commodities and private equity. Mr You suggests that a guideline would be to deduct a person's age from 100 to find out the percentage he should allocate to equities in his portfolio. ""If you're 30 years old, your portfolio should have a 70 per cent allocation to equities and a 30 per cent allocation to bonds,"" he notes. ""It's not a hard and fast rule, but it's a good starting point, and if you think you can afford to take on more risk, you can adjust (the equities) to 80 per cent or maybe even 90 per cent. ""The main point is, as you age, you should allocate an increasingly higher portion of your portfolio to safer assets like bonds. For investors who want to include alternative investments in their portfolios, the percentage should be around 10 to 20 per cent."" Mr Lee adds: ""I would encourage young investors to explore different investment approaches and then decide for themselves what works for them and stick to it.""

The group on Friday evening said fiscal 2019 net profit fell sharply, down 25.3 per cent to $560.3 million due to lumpiness in development earnings. The decrease was mainly due to lower contributions from development projects in Singapore and Australia, as well as a lower fair value gains. Revenue for the year ended Sept 30 was $3.8 billion, down 12.2 per cent. Shares of Frasers Property were down nine cents or 4.9 per cent at $1.73 as at 9.21am on Monday.

"China to lower import tariffs on frozen pork, avocados from January 1",Dec 23 2019,"BEIJING () - China will lower tariffs on products ranging from frozen pork and avocado to some types of semiconductors next year as Beijing looks to boost imports amid a slowing economy and a trade war with the United States. Next year, China will implement temporary import tariffs, which are lower than the most-favored-nation tariffs, on more than 850 products, the finance ministry said on Monday. By comparison, 706 products were taxed at temporary rates in 2019.  The tariff changes were made to “increase imports of products facing a relative domestic shortage, or foreign speciality goods for everyday consumption,” the ministry said in a statement on its website. China and the United States cooled their drawn-out trade war earlier this month, announcing a Phase 1 agreement that would reduce some U.S. tariffs in exchange for more Chinese purchases of American farm products and other goods. The finance ministry said the tariff rate for frozen pork will be cut to 8% from the most-favoured-nation duty of 12%, as China tries to plug a huge supply gap after disease decimated its hog herd. However, meat industry insiders in both China and the United States said the measure did not appear to affect the retaliatory tariffs in place for U.S. pork. Beijing has waived extra tariffs on some U.S. soybean and pork cargoes in recent weeks, in a goodwill gesture to Washington, as the two countries move closer to signing a trade deal.  The tariffs on U.S. pork, currently up to 72%, will go down to 68% when the tax rate cut takes effect in the new year. “U.S. pork will remain at a significant disadvantage compared to competing products until China's retaliatory duties are addressed,” the U.S. Meat Export Federation said in a statement. But the measure will help boost China's overall pork imports and ease the domestic shortage, analysts said.  “This is part of the Chinese government's serious effort to increase pork supplies. It will definitely help,” said Jim Huang, chief executive at China-America Commodity Data Analytics.  The tax rate cut applies to frozen hams, shoulders and cuts of swine, with bone in, and other frozen meat of swine. It does not affect other pig products, including offal, carcasses and chilled pork, according to the government notice.  An outbreak of African swine fever that began in August last year has nearly halved China's pig herd, official data showed, sending pork prices soaring to record levels.  Beijing has issued a series of measures to boost pig production, while increasing imports of various meats to meet domestic demand.  China brought in 229,707 tonnes of pork in November, up more than 150% from the previous year. Pork imports for the first 11 months of the year stood at 1.733 million tonnes, up 58% from a year earlier. Almost all of the pork shipments coming to China are frozen pork. The European Union, Canada and the United States are among the top exporters.   China will also lower temporary import tariffs for ferroniobium - used as an additive to high-strength low-alloy steel and stainless steel for oil and gas pipelines, cars and trucks - from 1% to zero in 2020 to support its high-tech development.  The country brought in 35,909 tonnes of ferroniobium in 2018 and 37,818 tonnes for the first 10 months of this year.  The tariff rate for frozen avocado was cut to 7% from the most-favoured-nation duty of 30%, the ministry said.  China's economy is expanding at its weakest rate in nearly 30 years and could face more downward pressure next year, but the government has vowed to keep growth within a reasonable range in 2020 and keep policies forward-looking and effective. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said China had agreed to buy $200 billion worth of additional U.S. goods and services over the next two years as part of the Phase 1 trade pact to be signed in early January. If the purchases are made, they would represent a huge jump in U.S. exports to China. Beijing has said the increased purchases are in line with the growing needs of the Chinese people, as the country opens its markets further to global trade. Tariffs for some asthma and diabetes medications will be set at zero, the ministry said, while duties on some wood and paper products will be lowered, too. Import tariffs on multi-component semiconductors will be cut to zero. China will also further lower most-favoured-nation import tariffs on some information technology products from July 1, the ministry said.

"Electric vehicle startup Rivian scores $1.3 billion investment from T.Rowe Price, others",Dec 23 2019,"() - Electric vehicle startup Rivian said on Monday it closed a $1.3 billion investment round led by T. Rowe Price and including existing investors Amazon.com and Ford Motor Co. The investment round, which also included BlackRock Inc, is the fourth this year for Rivian and positions the Plymouth, Michigan-based company as one of the better-financed players in a crowded EV manufacturing market where Tesla Inc is the most established player. “This investment demonstrates confidence in our team, products, technology and strategy,” Rivian Chief Executive R.J. Scaringe said in a statement. Electric vehicles still make up only a small piece of the global automotive market. While Tesla is the best-known maker,  China and Europe are pushing automakers to roll out EVs, and Ford, General Motors Co and others have announced plans to spend billions of dollars developing the vehicles.  Founded in 2009, Rivian plans to build an all-electric pickup truck, the R1T, and the companion R1S SUV, starting in late 2020. Both models are based on a Rivian-designed “skateboard,” a chassis that bundles electric motor, batteries and controls and can accommodate a variety of body styles. Prior to Monday's announcement, Rivian had raised $2.2 billion from investors, according to investor website PitchBook, and was valued at an estimated $5 billion to $7 billion.   The company's total valuation in the wake of the latest investment round was not immediately clear. Rivian said on Monday no new board seats were added as a result of the latest investment.  T. Rowe Price has placed other bets in the auto sector. It is a large Tesla shareholder and also has invested in GM's majority-owned Cruise self-driving division. T. Rowe Price also invested, along with Amazon, in self-driving car software startup Aurora and British online food delivery company Deliveroo. “T. Rowe Price is excited to invest in Rivian as it moves the innovation frontier forward with its compelling sustainable transport solutions for both consumers and businesses,” T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund Portfolio Manager Joe Fath said Monday in an emailed statement. Amazon, which has relationships and deals across the auto industry, led a $700 million investment round in Rivian in February. The e-commerce company also ordered 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian. The first Amazon vans will be built at a former Mitsubishi Motors Corp plant in Normal, Illinois, starting in 2021.     Amazon declined to comment on Monday.     Ford invested $500 million in Rivian in April and plans to help it begin production in Normal in 2020. “We want to maintain a meaningful value in the ownership and future of that company,” Ford spokesman T.R. Reid said on Monday about Rivian. In November, sources told  a battery-powered Lincoln SUV, due in mid-2022, would be the first Ford vehicle to be built on the Rivian skateboard. Cox Automotive Inc, owner of the Autotrader online automobile market and Kelley Blue Book car valuation service, invested $350 million in Rivian in September.

Roche dives deeper into gene therapy with $1.15 billion Sarepta licensing deal,Dec 23 2019,"() - Roche Holding AG made its second major gene therapy deal in a year on Monday, spending $1.15 billion to obtain the rights to Sarepta Therapeutics Inc's investigational drug to treat duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) outside the United States. The Swiss drugmaker closed a $4.3 billion deal to acquire Sparks Therapeutics this month, underscoring the growing appetite among large drugmakers for gene therapies. Roche will make an upfront payment of $750 million in cash and take a $400 million stake in Sarepta, priced at $158.59 per share, a premium of about 26% to the U.S. drugmaker's closing price on Friday. Shares of Sarepta, which already has non-gene therapies for DMD in the market, were up 9% at $138 before the bell. “This deal should increase confidence in Sarepta's entire DMD gene therapy program, remove any financing overhang, and allow Sarepta to retain control and flexibility,” Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Alethia Young said in a note. Gene therapies, one of the hottest areas of drug research, aim to correct certain diseases by replacing the missing or mutated version of a gene found in a patient's cells with healthy copies. Earlier this month, Japan's Astellas Pharma Inc said it was buying gene therapy developer Audentes Therapeutics Inc for about $3 billion - more than double the U.S. company's market value at the time. DMD is a rare degenerative neuromuscular disorder, which  affects about one in 3,500-5,000 male births worldwide, causes severe progressive muscle loss and premature death. Sarepta already has a large presence in the DMD market. Its Exondys 51, a non-gene therapy that was approved in 2016, brought in sales of $99 million in the latest quarter. Earlier this month, the company gained a surprise U.S. approval for another DMD drug Vyondys 53. The drugmaker is eligible to receive up to $1.7 billion in regulatory and sales milestones, plus royalties on net sales, Roche said, adding the agreement was expected to close in the first quarter of 2020. Sarepta will continue to be responsible for the clinical development and manufacturing of the gene therapy, SRP-9001, while sharing global clinical development costs equally with Roche. “This deal is as big as it gets for four patients worth of data and only ex-U.S. rights,” Baird analyst Brian Skorney said in a note.

Apache and Total team up for oil exploration off Suriname,Dec 23 2019,"() - Apache Corp and French rival Total have formed a joint venture to develop a project off Suriname, the companies said, in a deal that gives the U.S. oil and gas producer a cash injection.  Apache's Suriname offshore prospect, near the border with South America's newest oil giant, Guyana, is a long-shot for the U.S. company, with the Total agreement providing financing to continue exploration.  Apache reported this month it had reached its target depth at its first Suriname well but said only that it would drill deeper, knocking 17% off its shares in two days as investors took the news as a sign the well had no commercially viable oil. Apache shares rose 17% to $26.53 on Monday on news of the agreement. With the gain, the shares are about flat year-to-date, compared with a 28% increase in the S&P 500 index of major U.S. stocks.  Exploration off Suriname is being watched closely as it is just over the border from Exxon Mobil and Hess Corp's giant fields off the coast of Guyana estimated to hold more than 6 billion barrels of oil. Total has non-operating interests in two Guyana projects.  Total said it would give Apache a bonus of $100 million when the deal closes, reimburse half of Apache's costs to date for its first three exploration wells, and could pay more depending on further developments. Apache said it would receive $5 billion of cash carry on its first $7.5 billion of appraisal and development capital along with other considerations. Total eventually would become the operator of the wells. The deal reduces Apache's risk if the wells prove uneconomic, according to researchers at Cowen & Co, but “significantly reduces upside value potential.”   The U.S. oil producer has largely pulled back internationally to focus on its much-hyped Alpine High field in a remote corner of the Permian Shale basin, the top U.S. shale formation. However, Alpine High has been a disappointment, requiring enormous investment in pipeline infrastructure and delivering mostly natural gas at a time when prices are their lowest in more than two decades. Apache posted a $577 million loss in the first nine months of this year as it pulled back at Alpine High. Under the Suriname deal, Apache and Total will each hold a 50% working interest in Block 58. Apache will operate the first three exploration wells in the block, including the Maka Central-1 well, and subsequently transfer operations to Total.

Global shares inch to new highs on trade hopes; dollar little changed,Dec 23 2019,"NEW YORK () - The dollar traded little changed while equity markets added to a year-end rally on Monday, with both a gauge of stock performance worldwide and Wall Street hitting new highs amid renewed optimism over U.S.-China trade and growth prospects. China's finance ministry said it will lower tariffs on products ranging from frozen pork and avocados to certain semiconductors next year as Beijing looks to boost imports amid a slowing economy and a trade war with the United States. China will implement temporary import tariffs, which are lower than the most-favored-nation tariffs, on more than 850 products, an increase from 706 products that were taxed at temporary rates in 2019, the ministry said. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.08%, reaching a new record of 563.81, while its emerging market index rose 0.29%. MSCI's all-country world index has risen more than 3% in December as U.S.-China trade tensions eased and confidence grew that Britain would avoid a chaotic exit from the European Union. The index is up 23% in 2019, set for its best year in a decade. The market remains focused on the trade war, said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. “It's a rally being based upon momentum buying now. Stocks are being marked up, and it will continue right up until year end,” he said, referring to the U.S. equity market. President Donald Trump on Saturday said the United States and China would “very shortly” sign their so-called Phase 1 trade pact. The benchmark S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Dow Industrials set recording closing highs, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also hitting new intra-day highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 96.44 points, or 0.34%, to 28,551.53, the S&P 500  gained 2.79 points, or 0.09%, to 3,224.01 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 20.69 points, or 0.23%, to 8,945.65. The Dow was lifted by a 2.9% gain in shares of Boeing Co () after the planemaker fired Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg over intense scrutiny and industrial setbacks sparked  by twin fatal crashes of its 737 MAX jetliner. Shares in Europe traded near break-even, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index  closing down 0.03%.

In France, the CAC 40 index  gained 0.13% but the trade-sensitive Deutsche Boerse DAX  fell by the same amount. The index has gained steadily since September as the prospect of a Sino-U.S. trade deal improved. Overnight in Asia, Japan's Nikkei  closed little changed after hitting a 14-month top last week. Chinese stocks posted their worst single-day drop in six weeks, weighed down by a correction in tech shares after a state fund announced plans to cut its stakes in some chip makers. The dollar held near a two-week high against a basket of currencies, while sterling fell on concerns over the British government's hard line on Brexit talks. The dollar, which benefits when the U.S. economy outperforms others, as well as during bouts of risk aversion due to its safe-haven status, has been supported since Washington and Beijing came to an interim trade agreement earlier this month. The dollar index is up 1.6% for the year. On Monday the index .DXY fell 0.02%, with the euro  up 0.12% to $1.1091. The Japanese yen  strengthened 0.03% versus the greenback at 109.41 per dollar, while Sterling  traded at $1.2940, down 0.48% on the day. U.S. Treasury yields were little changed to slightly lower in generally thin trading as markets headed into the end of 2019. New orders for U.S.-made capital goods barely rose in November and shipments fell, suggesting business investment will probably remain a drag on economic growth in the fourth quarter.. Details of the Commerce Department report were not as soft as the headline suggested, analysts said, lifting yields off their lows. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR last fell 5/32 in price to yield 1.9329%.  Euro zone bond yields were broadly flat on Monday as investors chose safe-haven government debt in thin pre-holiday trade. Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund was little changed at -0.24% DE10YT=RR, about 6 basis points below last week's high. Oil prices edged higher as Russia said a producer group led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may consider easing output cuts next year, helping cap optimism that the U.S.-China trade deal will be signed soon and spur demand. Brent crude LCOc1 settled up 25 cents at $66.39 a barrel in thin trading. West Texas Intermediate CLc1 rose 8 cents to settle at $60.52 a barrel.

UK shares outshine as Europe hovers below record highs,Dec 23 2019,"() - European shares closed a sliver away from all-time highs on Monday, as a slide in eurozone banks countered optimism over the  U.S.-China trade deal and a stellar run for UK shares. With trading volumes dwindling as investors leave on Christmas holidays, analysts warn that market action could be volatile. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  saw trading volume down to 63% of its thirty-day moving average on Monday. The index closed flat after hitting a new record earlier in the session, aided by a ninth straight day of rise for Britain's FTSE 100  and defensive buying that boosted Europe's healthcare stocks .SXDP and Swiss equities index .  “Unsurprisingly, there has not been much news to drive the market forward, but hopes of a U.S.-China deal continue to be dangled like a carrot in front of investors,” Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG wrote in a client note. U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said Washington and Beijing would “very shortly” sign their so-called Phase One trade pact. Giving investors more reason to cheer, China's finance ministry said on Monday it would lower tariffs next year on U.S. products ranging from frozen pork and avocado to some types of semiconductors. However, trade-sensitive German  and French  shares moved little on the news. The star performers were UK mid-cap shares , which jumped 0.8% and the blue-chip index , which gained 0.5%, as investors stuck to hopes that Britain will exit the European Union by 2020. NMC (), whose shares have nearly halved in value since last week after Muddy Waters criticized the healthcare group's financials, shot up 37% after launching an independent review of its books. Shares in aerospace parts makers such as Senior Plc (), Melrose Industries () and Meggitt () rose between 1.3% and 2.8% after U.S. planemaker Boeing Co () ousted Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg following a production halt of its best-selling 737 MAX jetliner after two fatal crashes.  Eurozone banks .SX7E dropped about 1%. European Central Bank's (ECB) governing council member Klaas Knot said interest rates in the euro zone could remain historically low for years, but the ECB's ultra-loose monetary policy risks becoming counterproductive. A 4.9% decline for Italian infrastructure group Atlantia () pressured the wider country index . On Saturday, a report said the Italian government had provisionally approved a document to make it easier to revoke concessions to operate motorways. The decree does not mention Atlantia, but a government source told  that the measures could be applied to it.

"Protesters rally near Hong Kong harbor, more demos planned over Christmas",Dec 23 2019,"HONG KONG () - More than 1,000 protesters, many in surgical masks and balaclavas, filled a harborside plaza near Hong Kong's financial district late on Monday to demand full democracy and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality. As Hong Kong gears up for Christmas celebrations, the protesters plan wildcat gatherings in prime shopping malls and a ‘silent night' rally on Tuesday evening. The demonstrators gathered at the harborside on Monday sang “Glory to Hong Kong”, a protest anthem, and shone lights from their mobile phones. Henry, a 28-year-old banker, said he was in the plaza to protest a recent police shutdown of Spark Alliance, a fund-raising platform for protesters. He wore a Guy Fawkes mask from the movie “V for Vendetta”, which glowed green in the dark.  “The Hong Kong government is ruining our reputation as a financial center. How can they say we are a place for finance if they can shut down the fund so unreasonably?” he said. The protests, now in their seventh month, have lost some of the scale and intensity of earlier confrontations. Police have arrested more than 6,000 people since the protests escalated in June, including more than 52 over the past weekend.  Many Hong Kong residents are angry at what they see as Beijing's meddling in the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies interfering and says it is committed to the ‘one country, two systems' formula put in place at that time and has blamed foreign forces for fomenting unrest.  On Sunday, a peaceful protest ended in clashes when black-clad, masked demonstrators attacked police with kicks and punches and threw bricks and bottles. Police responded with bursts of pepper spray. One officer drew his pistol and pointed it towards a crowd but didn't fire,  witnesses said. Protesters plan to gather in five malls on Christmas Eve and will count down to Christmas near the harbor front in the bustling Tsim Sha Tsui district, social media posts say. More protests are planned for Christmas Day on Wednesday. The Civil Human Rights Front, which has organized some of the biggest marches involving more than a million people, has also applied to stage another march on New Year's Day. Some people taking part in Sunday's protest called for Hong Kong's independence from China and removed a Chinese flag from its pole, drawing condemnation from the government. Both the Beijing and Hong Kong governments have made clear such separatist rhetoric will not be tolerated. “Advocating Hong Kong independence ... is not conducive to the overall and long-term interest of Hong Kong society. It is also contrary to the established basic policies of the People's Republic of China regarding Hong Kong,” the city government said in a statement overnight. While police, including the leader of a major police union, have referred to the protesters as cockroaches, protesters routinely call the police dogs.  On Monday, public broadcaster RTHK broadcast a video of a police public relations officer playing down the significance of the term cockroach. The officer said the term should not be “over-interpreted” because while it may be negative, another way to understand it was that cockroaches were “full of vitality”.

"UPDATE 2-FTSE 100 gains for ninth straight session, midcaps near record high",Dec 23 2019,"* FTSE 100 up 0.5%, FTSE 250 up 0.8% * Markets seeing “classic squeeze” - analyst * NMC enjoys best day ever * Nichols slumps after profit alert (Adds news items, analyst comments, updates to closing prices) By Shashwat Awasthi Dec 23 () - Britain's blue-chip equities index gained for a ninth straight session on Monday in holiday-thinned trading, while midcaps hovered near all-time highs. The FTSE 100 rose 0.5% to hit its highest in nearly five months and match its best run of gains since May 2017. The FTSE 250 jumped 0.8%, up for the third straight session. Both benchmark indexes drifted lower in early dealings as traders locked in profits ahead of Christmas, but a lack of negative news and paltry trading volumes helped them recover. “Given the low liquidity conditions, it does not take much to change the market,” Raymond James analyst Chris Bailey said. “Note too the lack of real losers. Classic squeeze up just ahead of Christmas.” The stand-out gainer was NMC Health, which surged almost 37% on its best day ever after it promised an independent review of its books. Its shares had nearly halved in value last week after short-selling firm Muddy Waters questioned its finances. “The fact the company is taking such action implies they don't have anything to hide, which has encouraged some traders to swoop in and snap up the relatively cheap stock,” CMC Markets analyst David Madden said. Dealers seemed content to reflect on major developments of the month, including a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's election victory which have helped the FTSE 100 surge nearly 5% in the last two weeks. The exporter-heavy index is on course for its best month since June, while the more domestically-focussed midcaps are on track for a fourth straight month of gains. Both benchmark indexes look set for their ninth month of gains this year. Some of that momentum has eased after Johnson's hard line on a trade agreement with the European Union revived fears of a chaotic Brexit and market players are likely to hold off on making further bets before the new year. Lingering Brexit concerns left sterling hamstrung on Monday, boosting firms with a larger international exposure such as Shell, Unilever and Diageo, which lent further support to the main index.

Credit Suisse admits spying on second executive,Dec 23 2019,"ZURICH () - Credit Suisse () on Monday admitted to snooping on another of the bank's former executives, deepening a spying scandal at the Swiss group, which is already under investigation for putting its ex-wealth management chief under surveillance. Switzerland's second-largest bank blamed former chief operating officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee for hiring detectives in February to track former HR head Peter Goerke. They described a rogue operation in which all executives and directors, including Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam, were kept in the dark about what was going on. Credit Suisse had earlier blamed Bouee for a similar incident involving former wealth management boss Iqbal Khan and had also cleared Thiam of any role in it. At the time, Thiam characterized it as an “isolated incident”.  was not immediately able to reach Bouee and Goerke for comment. “The observation of Peter Goerke, which has now been confirmed, is inexcusable,” Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner said in a statement, adding there was “grave concern” that those responsible for ordering the surveillance had not mentioned it during an earlier probe regarding Khan. “We are aware that the observation of Iqbal Khan and Peter Goerke have damaged the reputation of our bank,” Rohner said. Goerke had no knowledge that he had been followed by private detectives until officials from the bank contacted him shortly before Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung made the matter public last Monday, a person familiar with his thinking said.  Goerke, who remains employed by the bank as an adviser, saw no grounds to pursue the matter criminally, the person said, and was in contact with senior officials at Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse has been in the spotlight since September when Khan filed a criminal complaint in Zurich after a confrontation  between him and one of the private detectives tailing him.  The bank launched an investigation and found it had bankrolled the surveillance. An investigation by law firm Homburger into the spying on Khan — who now works for rival UBS () — had found Bouee and a security boss under him were alone responsible for the order and found no evidence of other incidents. Both resigned and Credit Suisse said on Monday that Bouee's employment had now been terminated for cause, indicating his bonus and other potential compensation would likely be forfeited. Bouee was a long-time associate of Thiam and had followed him to Credit Suisse from Prudential ().  Harris Associates, the bank's third-largest investor, according to Refinitiv data, remained positive.  “We are extremely supportive of the CS executive management team - a team that we believe has greatly improved CS over the last four years,” David Herro, manager of the firm's Oakmark International Fund, told . Switzerland's finance watchdog is looking into the bank's surveillance activities and its corporate governance. There is also a criminal probe into the Khan affair. A Credit Suisse spokesman said Credit Suisse and Homburger would continue their latest probe having determined that Bouee and others involved had not told the truth when asked about any other surveillance orders in September and had taken care not to leave any identifiable traces in the bank's systems. “Credit Suisse will look into any relevant indications if we receive information about alleged (surveillance),” he said. Credit Suisse stock was down 0.4% at 1530 GMT while the European bank sector index .SX7P was off 0.7%. ","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.834, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.9669}",0.9669
NMC Health shares rebound as it promises independent review of books,Dec 23 2019,"() - NMC Health shares leapt about a third in value on Monday, recouping some of their recent losses, after the healthcare group said it would launch an independent review of its finances  following criticism by short-selling firm Muddy Waters. NMC (), the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates, said the review would be undertaken by an unidentified accounting firm and overseen by a committee of independent NMC non-executive directors. Muddy Waters took a short position in NMC last week and questioned the value of its assets and cash balance, as well as reported profits and debts, triggering a plunge in NMC's shares from over 26 pounds to less than 13 pounds.  The stock was last up 35% at about 17.40 pounds, on track for its biggest ever daily gain.  Short selling involves borrowing an asset and selling it with the aim of buying it back at a cheaper price and making a profit. About 10% of NMC's outstanding shares were part of short positions as of Dec. 13, according to FIS data. “We are confident that this review, when complete, will be entirely confirmatory of the disclosures provided by the company to date,” NMC said. Muddy Waters said in a statement that NMC should also engage a law firm as part of its review, and make both the scope of the review and the full report by the investigation firm public. NMC, which in 2012 became the first from Abu Dhabi to list on the London Stock Exchange, last week stood by its 2019 and 2020 forecasts, and issued a detailed response to the allegations from Muddy Waters. Muddy Waters, founded by American Carson Block, is known in financial markets for declaring short equity positions on the basis of its in-house research.

Disruptive decade: Ten things the teen years brought world markets,Dec 23 2019,"LONDON () - The 21st century's teen years, bookended by a financial crisis at the start and the fintech revolution at the end, were a decade of disruption. From negative borrowing costs to bitcoin, here are ten trends that have upended traditional economic and investment models in the past decade: 1/FAANG-TASTIC FIVE If they were a country, they would be the fifth largest in terms of economic output, outgunning Britain and snapping at Germany's heels. With a $3.9 trillion market value (versus around $100 billion in January 2010), tech giants Facebook, Amazon.com, Apple, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet — collectively known as the FAANGs — are not only at the vanguard of history's longest share bullrun but have transformed how humans work, shop, consume news and relax. FAANGs comprise 7% of the MSCI global equity index today, up from around 1.6% in early 2010. The savvy investor who sank $25,000 in Netflix in 2009 would now be sitting on $1 million. And in the slip stream of the five pioneers, other tech titans are rising, from China's BAT grouping of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent to sector “disupters” Uber, Airbnb and Deliveroo. For better or worse, the world — and markets — have changed for ever.      (GRAPHIC: Rise of the FAANGs - )     A defining feature of the years following the 2008-2009 meltdown was the slide of interest rates and government borrowing costs below 0%, possibly for the first time in history. U.S. and German 10-year borrowing costs collapsed by 200 to 400 basis points this decade; the latter to as low as minus 0.7%. Roughly $12 trillion in debt carries negative yields, almost a quarter of all bonds outstanding. The drivers — central banks' asset buying, sub-zero interest rates, yield curve manipulation and the tech revolution's deflationary effects — were in themselves groundbreaking, at least in terms of scale. The Bank of Japan holds assets collectively worth more than Japan's economy. The European Central Bank's balance sheet is a quarter the euro zone's annual output but double decade-ago levels. Interactive graphic on central bank balance sheet  (GRAPHIC: Borrowing costs collapsed in the 2010s - )         With record-low rates and yield-starved investors, bonds with tenors longer than the average human lifespan have caught on.  A handful of 100-year bonds were around in 2010, but Mexico's $1 billion issue maturing 2110 started an issuance surge that saw U.S. and British universities, Ireland, Belgium and Austria, U.S. municipalities and corporations such as Coca Cola and Petrobras sell century bonds. Even junk-rated serial defaulter Argentina drew huge bids for its 2117-maturity bond.   Just over 1,400 century bonds, worth almost $170 billion are now outstanding, according to Refinitiv.  But ... caveat emptor. Buyers of the Argentine century bond have watched it lose half its value. Austria's issue, also sold in 2017, is up more than 60%. Interactive graphic (graphics//item:portal/graphic/0H001QXPG9W8)?q=wild&pa=true&pi=true&rdts=1577100590091  (GRAPHIC: Tale of two centuries - )     In 2010, Bitcoin was an idea causing ripples in niche online forums. Ten years later, cryptocurrencies are intertwined with finance, business and politics. Crypto markets, non-existent in 2010, are now worth over $200 billion, having hit a $815 billion peak at the apex of the bitcoin bubble. Having changed hands for just 3 cents in its first public trade, bitcoin now trades over $7,500. That's off its peak near $20,000, though - a reminder of its volatility. Usage has also spread. Coin Metrics estimates that from 130 active bitcoin addresses a decade back, there are now nearly 750,000. Crypto took many guises through the 2010s, from rebel technology to a tool for criminals, speculative token to the great hope for frictionless payments. While it never really shook off doubts over security, virtual money and blockchain tech have evolved at a dizzying pace, typified recently by Facebook's push to launch its Libra token and steps by central banks to create their own digital currencies. Interactive graphic  (GRAPHIC: Bitcoin in the 2010s - )     Sometimes it's better to be passive. The punter who opted to ride the past decade's equity boom via an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking the S&P500 would have earned 200% but at a fraction of the fee a mutual fund manager would have charged. Hence spectacular ETF growth — assets have swelled to almost $7 trillion, from below $2 trillion in 2010, consultancy ETFGI says. Low investment fees should help extend the boom: total ETF assets could hit $50 trillion in 2030, BofA predicts.     (GRAPHIC: ETF asset upsurge -  )    With the hottest four years on record occurring in the past four years (according to the  World Meteorological Organization), climate is shaping investor thinking in a way it did not a decade ago.  Crop failures, floods and wildfires can all inflict portfolio losses. More funds are reducing exposure to polluting industries, embracing renewables and water conservation technologies or investing in the likes of fake-meat firm Beyond Meat, whose 2019 IPO was greeted with rapture on Wall Street.  Over $30 trillion is held in sustainable or green investments, the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance estimates, more than doubling from 2011.  Green bonds debuted in 2007 to fund projects with environment benefits. This year, issuance totaled a record $200 billion-plus. (GRAPHIC: Green bond issuance ends decade with record year - ) Having learned to wring oil from shale with fracking, the United States has vaulted to the top of the  oil producer rankings, with 12.5 million barrels per day of output, double 2010 levels. Shale oil production exceeds 9 million bpd, from below one million bpd in 2010, making the United States an oil exporter for the first time in 40 years. The shale boom is partly why conversations around energy have switched from peak supply to peak demand. Surging output comes alongside environmental concerns, meaning an oil glut is likelier than shortages. Interactive chart  (GRAPHIC: U.S. crude oil production, 2000-2019 - )     Having relied for over a century on the internal combustion engine, the global auto industry is being upended by battery-powered cars. In 2010, electric car maker Tesla went public and its shares, launched at $17, now trade at $380.  Hundreds of billions of dollars have been pledged to develop a new generation of electric cars. Industries supplying car batteries are booming and demand for their main component, lithium, could triple by 2025. EV sales so far have disappointed — two out of 100 cars sold today are electric. Petrol and diesel vehicles are cheaper and EV charging infrastructure is limited.  But growing alarm over climate change and government incentives to steer consumers away from petrol means the electric revolution looks unstoppable.     (GRAPHIC: Tesla's first decade - )     Tech's transformative power has not bypassed currency trading floors. Ten years ago, dealers did the buying and selling for banks and clients. Today, electronic trading comprises 90% of some products, doubling in this period. Another shift is toward “algos” — computer programs that follow pre-set instructions, or algorithms, to trade, often at speeds impossible for humans. From being largely nonexistent a decade ago, algo trading now comprises a fifth of FX spot volumes on Refinitiv FXall, a platform for the buyside. On another venue EBS, over 80% of the order book is algo-driven, the Bank for International Settlements estimates. One side effect is that ‘flash crashes' — wild exchange rate swings — have become frequent, ostensibly due to algos that are programmed to turn off if markets become volatile.     The winners? Those who can afford the most sophisticated algos. Almost half of global currency trading is now with the top five banks, with smaller institutions — and of course, traders — having to exit.     (GRAPHIC: Algorithmic vs manual on EBS - )     Marijuana took a trip this decade from street corners to stock markets. The first pure-play U.S. “potstock” — Tilray — debuted on NasDaq in 2018, leaping 36% on the first day. And 18 months since Canada legalized recreational cannabis, hundreds of potstocks are trading. Pot also spawned one of the decade's asset bubbles. Dubbed the green rush, shares in firms such as Aurora Cannabis and Canopy Growth rose several-fold before peaking in October 2018. At their high, the 10 biggest components of a potstock benchmark, the Alternative Harvest ETF, were worth $50 billion. A year later, $30 billion had gone up in smoke. Blame regulation and overproduction hitting weed prices. A sign of a maturing industry? The highs may have evaporated, but potstocks aren't going anywhere. Except perhaps London, which may host the next set of cannabis listings in 2020.

"RPT-Electric vehicle startup Rivian scores $1.3 bln investment from T.Rowe Price, others",Dec 23 2019,"(Repeats to remove word in headline) By Ben Klayman Dec 23 () - Electric vehicle startup Rivian said on Monday it closed a $1.3 billion investment round, led by fund manager T. Rowe Price but also including existing investors online retailer Amazon.com Inc and No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co. The investment round, which also included BlackRock Inc, is the fourth this year for Rivian and positions the Plymouth, Michigan-based company as one of the better-financed players in a crowded EV manufacturing market where Tesla Inc is the most established player. “This investment demonstrates confidence in our team, products, technology and strategy,” Rivian Chief Executive R.J. Scaringe said in a statement. Electric vehicles still make up only a small piece of the global automotive market. While Tesla is the best-known maker, China and Europe are pushing automakers to roll out EVs, and Ford, General Motors Co and others have announced plans to spend billions of dollars developing the vehicles. Founded in 2009, Rivian plans to build an all-electric pickup truck, the R1T, and the companion R1S SUV, starting in late 2020. Both models are based on a Rivian-designed “skateboard,” a chassis that bundles electric motor, batteries and controls and can accommodate a variety of body styles. Prior to Monday's announcement, Rivian had raised $2.2 billion from investors, according to investor website PitchBook, and was valued at an estimated $5 billion to $7 billion. Rivian said on Monday no new board seats were added as a result of the latest investment. T. Rowe Price has placed other bets in the auto sector. It is a large Tesla shareholder and also has invested in GM's majority-owned Cruise self-driving division. T. Rowe Price also invested, along with Amazon, in self-driving car software startup Aurora and British online food delivery company Deliveroo. Amazon, which has relationships and deals across the auto industry, led a $700 million investment round in Rivian in February. The e-commerce giant also ordered 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian. The first Amazon vans will be built at a former Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Illinois, starting in 2021. Ford invested $500 million in Rivian in April and plans to help it begin production in Normal in 2020. “We want to maintain a meaningful value in the ownership and future of that company,” Ford spokesman T.R. Reid said of Rivian. In November, sources told  a battery-powered Lincoln SUV, due in mid-2022, would be the first Ford vehicle to be built on the Rivian skateboard.

Founded in 2009, Rivian plans to build an all-electric pickup truck, the R1T, and the companion R1S SUV, starting in late 2020. Both models are based on a Rivian-designed “skateboard,” a chassis that bundles electric motor, batteries and controls and can accommodate a variety of body styles. Prior to Monday's announcement, Rivian had raised $2.2 billion from investors, according to investor website PitchBook, and was valued at an estimated $5 billion to $7 billion. Rivian said on Monday no new board seats were added as a result of the latest investment. T. Rowe Price has placed other bets in the auto sector. It is a large Tesla shareholder and also has invested in GM's majority-owned Cruise self-driving division. T. Rowe Price also invested, along with Amazon, in self-driving car software startup Aurora and British online food delivery company Deliveroo. Amazon, which has relationships and deals across the auto industry, led a $700 million investment round in Rivian in February. The e-commerce giant also ordered 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian. The first Amazon vans will be built at a former Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Illinois, starting in 2021. Ford invested $500 million in Rivian in April and plans to help it begin production in Normal in 2020. “We want to maintain a meaningful value in the ownership and future of that company,” Ford spokesman T.R. Reid said of Rivian. In November, sources told  a battery-powered Lincoln SUV, due in mid-2022, would be the first Ford vehicle to be built on the Rivian skateboard.

Portugal sticks to 0.1% deficit forecast after nine-month surplus,Dec 23 2019,"LISBON () - Portugal's budget surplus widened to 1% of gross domestic product in the first nine months of 2019 from 0.4% a year earlier, the National Statistics Institute said on Monday, but the government said it still expected a small full-year deficit. Speaking to reporters, Finance Minister Mario Centeno said the nine-month surplus reflected solid revenue growth in an expanding economy. But he cautioned that “the budget execution throughout the year is not linear”, with various payments concentrated in the last quarter. “We reiterate the projection we've made,” he said, referring to a 0.1% deficit estimated by the government earlier. Last year, the deficit for the whole year was 0.4% - the lowest in more than four decades and a sharp improvement in the country's financial position from its 2011-14 debt crisis. Next year, the Socialist government expects to post Portugal's first full-year budget surplus since democracy returned in 1974, of 0.2%, with economic growth remaining steady at 1.9%.

Bosnian lawmakers approve new government after 14-month deadlock,Dec 23 2019,"SARAJEVO () - Bosnian lawmakers approved a new central government on Monday after a 14-month deadlock, opening the way for a resumption of reforms needed to become a candidate for EU membership and for talks on a new deal with the International Monetary Fund. Disagreement among the Bosnian presidency's Serb, Croat and Bosniak members on how to proceed toward NATO integration had blocked the formation of a new government since a national election in the ethnically divided Balkan nation last year.     But after a compromise between the ethnic groups last month, parliament approved Bosnian Serb economist Zoran Tegeltija as prime minister on Dec. 5. Tegeltija had previously served as finance minister in Bosnia's autonomous Serb Republic  On Monday parliament approved Tegeltija's proposed new cabinet team by 29 votes in the 42-seat parliament. The prime minister made no statement after the vote. Tegeltija, from the Bosnian Serb ruling SNSD party, was nominated by SNSD chief Milorad Dodik, who also serves as a Serb member on Bosnia's tripartite presidency, in exchange for a reform program demanded by NATO, previously blocked by the Serbs who oppose closer ties with the alliance. His cabinet will include nine ministers from the three biggest ethnic parties - the SNSD, the Croats' HDZ and the Bosniaks' SDA - and two ministers from the SDA's junior partners, the SBB and the DF. A minister for human rights and refugees has yet to be approved because of procedural delays, Tegeltija said. After the 1992-95 war that destroyed the old Yugoslavia, Bosnia was split into two autonomous regions linked by a weak central government: the Serb Republic and the Federation, dominated by Bosniak Muslims and Croats. The latter has yet to form a new government. Tegeltija has said his key priority will be to unblock reforms needed for Bosnia to secure the status of a candidate for eventual European Union membership, and also to release frozen investments to spur much-needed economic growth. Bosnia lags its Balkan neighbors in the race to join the EU, due partly to its unwieldy political structures and lack of a strong central administration. Bosnia signed a 553 million euro ($612.7 million) loan deal with the IMF in 2016 but it was frozen in 2018 over stalled economic reforms.

Modi's party loses Indian state election amid protests over citizenship law,Dec 23 2019,"NEW DELHI () - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party lost control of another state on Monday, adding to a string of electoral losses since last December amid protests that mark the biggest challenge to the Hindu-nationalist leader. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) conceded defeat in the eastern state of Jharkhand, with an alliance of the main opposition Congress party and a regional bloc slated to take control of the resource-rich province. “I dedicate this victory to the people of Jharkhand,” Hemant Soren, leader of the regional Jharkhand Mukti Morcha party, said after claiming victory. The loss comes in the middle of a sometimes deadly wave of nationwide protests triggered by a new citizenship law, which critics say discriminates against Muslims and has brought thousands of people out on to the streets in opposition. The polls in Jharkhand opened on Nov. 30, before the demonstrations kicked off and do not represent the current public mood. However, the BJP's defeat will be a shot in the arm for India's opposition parties, some of which have used popular anger against the Citizenship Amendment Act to their advantage. The Modi government insists that the law is needed to help persecuted non-Muslim minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who came to India before 2015 by giving them Indian citizenship. And in a show of strength on Monday, the BJP staged a protest, attended by several hundred people, in Kolkata in support of the CAA. “Today, we have seen that Bengal stands with Modi ji and it welcomes the Citizenship Amendment Act,” said Jagat Prakash Nadda, the BJP's national working president, using an honorific for the prime minister. But groups opposed to the law gathered in the southern cities of Bangalore and Chennai, the capital New Delhi and north eastern Assam state, in the latest demonstrations against the CAA and the Modi government's proposal to conduct a nationwide National Register of Citizens. In Assam, protests have been held since Dec. 10, initially turning violent but largely peaceful over the past week.  Assam's finance minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, told reporters that since Dec. 10, 393 people have been arrested for arson, violence and looting and 10 for “inflammatory” social media posts.

"UCore, Materion team up to apply for U.S. military rare earths funding",Dec 23 2019,"() - Rare earths miner UCore Rare Metals Inc and manufacturer Materion Corp said on Monday they will form a consortium to jointly apply for U.S. military funding of a rare earths processing plant.   reported earlier this month that the U.S. Department of Defense plans to fund construction of rare earths processing facilities, part of a push by Washington to ensure its military has adequate supply of the minerals used to make weapons and electronics. The Pentagon plans to pick one or more winners to receive funding to build a pilot plant to process so-called heavy rare earths, a less-common type of the specialized minerals used in weaponry.      UCore and Materion are effectively betting that by merging their areas of expertise, their application will be more appealing to the Pentagon. “We believe that the combination of our experience and breadth of knowledge presents a winning opportunity,” said Lawrence Ryczek, Materion's vice president of aerospace and defense.   Texas Mineral Resources Corp and a joint venture between Australia's Lynas Corp and privately held Blue Line Corp of Texas also plan to apply. Lynas and Blue Line earlier this year announced their partnership, one that served as a model for UCore and Materion's consortium.  “We were looking for something that would put us directly in the same league as Lynas with this value proposition, and we've done that,” said Jim McKenzie, chief executive of UCore, which is developing a rare earths mine in Alaska.  The U.S. military's request does not give a specific financial amount for the award, though it is derived in part from the Defense Production Act (DPA), a 1950s-era U.S. law that gives the Pentagon wide financial latitude to procure equipment necessary for the national defense. Beyond finances, whomever is chosen is expected to receive a large public relations boost and become recognized in the rare earths industry as one capable of meeting the U.S. military's high standards.  The deadline to apply is Monday. Materion has previously received financial support from the U.S. military to produce beryllium, a mineral used as a hardening agent for weapons. The beryllium production process has similarities to rare earths processing.  “We have a track record of taking a concept on paper, meeting the requirements of the (U.S.) military and taking the project to fruition,” said Materion's Ryczek.    “There's no reason why we can't help the (U.S.) rare earths supply chain be successful as well.” ","{'neg': 0.029, 'neu': 0.878, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': 0.9722}",0.9722
"Equinor, Rosneft to develop Arctic oilfield in joint investment",Dec 23 2019,"OSLO/MOSCOW () - Russia's Rosneft and Norway's Equinor have agreed details on how to develop an Arctic Siberian onshore oilfield, they said on Monday, their first joint investment since agreeing a strategic partnership in 2012. The firms expect to extract about 250 million barrels of oil and 23 billion cubic meters of gas in the first stage of developing the Severo-Komsomolskoye oilfield, Equinor said, without giving a value for the investment. Rosneft has a 66.67% stake and Equinor holds the remaining shares in SevKomNeftegaz, which owns the license. Rosneft and Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, initially agreed to develop an onshore North Komsomolskoye oilfield in 2013, before Western sanctions were imposed on Rosneft in 2014 because of Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis.  Sanctions ban western companies from assisting Rosneft in exploring deepwater and Arctic offshore fields or helping Rosneft extract shale oil. They also limit Rosneft's ability to raise long-term financing in Western markets.  Rosneft said in 2015 that the North Komsomolskoye field has “complex geology associated with an oil rim of highly viscous oil”, describing the resources as “difficult-to-extract”.  Viscous oil is heavy oil, which does not easily flow through production equipment as well as light crude. Heavy oil also tends to be responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than light crude as it requires more energy to produce.  Equinor CEO Eldar Saetre said in 2017 that the company would no longer explore for heavy oil, but its spokesman told  in November it might still develop the heavy oil assets it already had in its portfolio, such as North-Komsomolskoye.

"Leveraged loan market size doubles in ten years, private credit explodes",Dec 23 2019,"NEW YORK, Dec 23 (LPC) - What a difference 10 years make. It was December 2010, in the aftermath of the financial crisis when the US government was forced to approve a US$700bn rescue package slated to avert the collapse of the country's financial system. The 2008 crisis was perhaps the first time many American households learned about leveraged loans for companies that take on significant amounts of debt. And households did so amid the chaos and worry of a long and deep recession for which many thought the obscure and little-known loan product was partially to blame. The loan market, which provides funding for US corporates, and pays investors an interest rate tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate for the privilege of borrowing, was just US$497.5bn in size in December 2010. Average loan bids bounced back from a low of 62.8 during the financial crisis but were still sitting at 96.61. Fast forward to December 2019 and the size of the leveraged loan market has more than doubled to US$1.2trn. Loans have rallied, pushing prices to an average 98.95 cents on the dollar, the highest level since October 2018. “The growth in the loan market has been a big phenomenon,” said Jonathan Insull, a managing director at Crescent Capital Group, which oversees more than US$26bn in assets. Ten years of low interest rates that injected the financial system with much needed liquidity after the crisis allowed US companies to binge on cheap loans. Loan trades became quicker, and the secondary market, where bankers and investors exchange pieces of loans like stocks or bonds, deepened. The size of the transactions got larger as loans evolved into a mature asset class. Leveraged loans returned 7% this year, per Refinitiv LPC data. High-yield bonds, meanwhile, returned less than 14%, according to the ICE BofAML US High Yield index. Lender protections eroded as private equity sponsors, attracted by the leverage on offer, tapped the loan market to fund buyouts –and cash out soon after. Idiosyncratic terms like covenant-lite became the norm in the institutional market, as well as sponsors massaging debt-to-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization levels (Ebitda), through add-backs, which lower leverage through expected synergies or future cost savings. And companies including Neiman Marcus and PetSmart created unrestricted subsidiaries in a bid to shield their most valuable assets from creditors. The market's explosive growth and notoriety resulted in increased oversight as regulators, wary of another downturn, tried to crack down on excesses. “The benefits have been greater liquidity and a larger asset class,” Insull said.” In the last 10 years loans have become more mainstream. It has also attracted more attention.” The 2010 Dodd-Frank bill, which was signed by President Barack Obama, banned banks from speculating with their own money and forced Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) managers to retain 5% of their funds, or have ‘skin in the game.' The Volcker Rule, better known for its ban on prop trading, prohibited banks from investing in CLOs that own bonds, which led the funds to purchase loans only or lose important investors. Leveraged lending guidance from the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, which was updated in 2013, curbed debt limits in buyouts and encouraged quick debt repayments. But even a tougher regulatory environment couldn't slow the growth of leveraged loans. The leveraged loan explosion that took place this decade would not be possible without the appetite from CLOs, the largest buyer of leveraged loans. After being compared to Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs), which earned significant notoriety – a bad reputation – due to the defaulted mortgages they held, leading to the financial crisis, CLO issuance ground to a halt. As the narrative changed and the public became better educated on differences between the two markets, CLO issuance soared. The asset class has grown 144% since the start of 2013 through the end of November, according to LPC Collateral data. US CLO issuance continued at a strong pace in 2019 after a record 2018. There has been more than US$114bn US CLOs arranged this year, through December 18, according to the data. “The obvious change is really the growth of the marketplace both for CLOs and loans, since they are interconnected, and in particular, the growth of the CLO market given how well it performed through the crisis and the ensuing resurgent issuance that has driven the market,” said Steven Oh, global head of credit and fixed income at PineBridge Investments, which oversees more than US$96bn in assets. The result of the post-crisis regulatory crackdown was a pullback in lending by some of the largest banks, which pushed the more aggressive financings to institutions not subject to the guidance, and the private debt lending system was created. “The theme for 2019 was private debt,” Grant Moyer, head of leveraged capital markets, told journalists at an MUFG event on Tuesday. “The emergence or takeoff – it's been a slow build after the financial crisis in 2008 … and really started ramping in 2014 and 2015, creating an opportunity for private debt markets to be more aggressive in facilitating for issuers.” Initially known as shadow banking, the private lending market is perhaps the most significant effect of the new regulations in the loan market in the last 10 years. Enabling this movement was a wave of institutional capital pouring into alternative investments in a global hunt for yield. “Negative interest rates created an environment where investors have had to reach further down the risk spectrum,” said Elaine Stokes, a portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles. “Around the world, this leaves investors challenged when looking for returns (on investment).” As a result, insurance companies and pension funds turned to riskier investment strategies to obtain higher returns and plug growing deficits. Private credit funds benefited and raised record amounts of capital allowing them the firepower to compete head-to-head with traditional banks for deals. “Shadow banking, or unregulated financiers, can be more creative and take more risk (than banks),” said Todd Koretzky, a partner at law firm Allen & Overy. “It's a lower-risk proposition for a borrower as they lock in a relationship through a club.” Driven by interest from private equity funds and with a focus on the middle market, which was largely being ignored by financial institutions, private credit flourished. “The middle market space has been inundated with a number of new lenders and new direct lenders as well as regular asset managers that have been active for a number of years,” said Art de Pena, head of loan syndications and distribution at MUFG. “As they've grown their assets under management, they said, ‘Hey, how do I see more transactions?' And instead of waiting for Credit Suisse or RBS to bring deals to them, they are saying, ‘Let's go direct.' So direct lending has become really in vogue.” This year saw a wave of US$1bn-plus unitranches underwritten by the larger players in the private credit space, a milestone first hit in 2016 when Ares led a US$1bn financing for a buyout of Qlik Technologies by private equity firm Thoma Bravo. Direct lenders “call the sponsors directly and they call corporates directly and they say we can take distribution risk off the table by giving you immediate capital and we can hold that capital for long term, so therefore it's a lot more attractive than taking market distribution risk,” de Pena said. In the last five years, private credit has become a mainstream asset class. Banks run private credit funds through asset management arms. Private equity firms operate credit shops and other firms have the backing of large financial institutions and pension funds. Private credit funds come from a range of constituency. Some were born in the world of private equity by firms seeking to diversify their offering by managing private credit funds. These include KKR &Co, Carlyle Group, Bain Capital and Apollo Global Management. Some of the largest players in the market, such as Ares Management Corp, Golub Capital, and Owl Rock Capital Group, were conceived in credit. Antares Capital, a unit of GE Capital that dominated the non-bank lending market in the first half of the decade, was sold to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in 2015. Twin Brook Capital Partners and Churchill Capital, two of the most active managers in the core middle market, are owned by investment firms Nuveen and Angelo Gordon. Most private credit funds also manage public and private Business Development Companies to provide funding for loans and source funding from retail investors. While institutional capital deployed in funds has fueled a structural realignment in the leveraged finance market, many market participants are weary the private credit asset class has not been tested through a downturn, which could, in the best case, cause the market to consolidate. While private credit continues to dominate the discussion, the biggest investment banks have benefited from President Trump's business-friendly policies, pushing them back to the top of the league tables and bringing the loan market full circle over the last decade.

Two of the sources said Emaar had appointed Standard Chartered () to advise it on the sale of the popular “At The Top” tourist attraction. Emaar, in which the Dubai government has a minority stake of 29.2%, and Standard Chartered declined to comment. At over 828 metres, the Burj Khalifa is twice as tall as New York's Empire State Building and nearly three times the height of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. At The Top is a popular tourist destination in Dubai, which attracted 15.92 million overnight visitors in 2018.

Dubai is a regional hub for tourism, foreign trade and business services, but has faced a slowing real estate market for most of the decade. It set up a real estate planning commission in September to regulate projects and avoid competition between semi-government and private firms. Emaar has been divesting hospitality related assets to finance existing operations and expansion, an industry source and a Dubai-based banker said.

The Yankees are coming! U.S. firms rush to euro debt markets,Dec 23 2019,"LONDON () - From Harley Davidson to Colgate-Palmolive, U.S. companies are flocking to borrow in euros and their record issuance is breathing life into a market where yields have been hammered by the European Central Bank's renewed stimulus push. Offshore fundraising by U.S. firms — dubbed the “reverse Yankee” in reference to Yankee bonds, which are sold by foreign entities in the United States — has been a regular feature of the euro debt market. But issuance by non-financial, investment-grade U.S. firms has quadrupled this year from 2018 levels, to around 93 billion euros ($103 billion), Dealogic data shows. That accounted for 27% of a total 346 billion euros ($383 billion) of euro-denominated investment-grade corporate bond issuance, according to the data.  From pharmaceuticals to consumer goods makers to fintech, the reverse Yankee has become the go-to market for U.S. companies which are now the largest source of corporate bond sales in Europe, according to BofA.  And if the boom extends into 2020, the United States would become the largest country in the ICE-BofA euro zone corporate debt index, overtaking France, the bank says.  The rush is driven primarily by rock-bottom borrowing costs in the euro zone, where interest rates are at minus 0.5% and the average yield on corporate euro-denominated bonds has fallen to 0.48% — down from 1.25% at the start of 2019. European credit markets offer “the best funding conditions for global issuers” said BofA's head of credit strategy Barnaby Martin. “They're not going to be able to find that anywhere else.”  Euro issuance allows U.S. borrowers to replace high-coupon, shorter-dated dollar debt with longer, lower-coupon euro debt. That lowers financing costs and improves the results of companies with euro-denominated assets, said Marc Baigneres, head of Western Europe investment-grade finance at JPMorgan. Mergers and acquisitions are another factor — fintech Fidelity National Information Services, for example, raised 5 billion euros back in May as part of a multi-currency deal to finance its purchase of card payment firm Worldpay. Graphic: Share of outstanding euro-denominated debt  The reverse Yankee boom is welcome news for European bond buyers dismayed at the yield collapse triggered by the ECB's asset purchase program.  The euro zone's central bank, which resumed buying bonds in October, holds 183 billion euros of corporate debt. Toward the end of quantitative easing a year ago, it was estimated to hold a fifth of the eligible corporate debt stock.  Because reverse Yankees are not usually eligible for ECB purchases, they often carry higher yields than similarly rated euro zone issues. They also made up a significant chunk of this year's longer-maturity debt, including half the 30-year corporate bonds sold, according to Refinitiv.  These longer, higher-yield issues are especially popular with investors. Triple B-rated reverse Yankee bonds of seven to 10 years' maturity can offer a spread of up to 25 basis points more than euro zone equivalents that are eligible for ECB purchase, research company CreditSights calculates.  BofA's Martin reckons U.S. names could lure giant Asian life insurers to invest in euro debt. These investors hold over 10% of the U.S. credit market, International Monetary Fund data shows, but they are less familiar with euro zone companies. “If many of the U.S. issuers come in euro format, it's easier for (insurers) to buy euro investment-grade,” Martin said. “It will create additional demand and it will be bullish for the market.”  Graphic: Reverse Yankee bond issuance jumps in 2019  With the ECB expected to stick with stimulus and the U.S. Federal Reserve not cutting rates for now, analysts predict reverse Yankee issuance will exceed 2019 levels next year. Companies such as Amazon and Visa which have significant euro revenues but no euro debt could tap the market, said BofA, which expects reverse Yankees' share of the index to rise to 20.8% by November 2020, from the current 18%. But the greater presence of American companies could create additional risk, warns Rachid Semaoune, a credit fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, because U.S. corporate behavior differs from that of European peers. Commerzbank estimates that U.S. firms had a free cash flow level of around minus $300 billion in 2018 — the ninth straight year of negative flows. That is a measure of how much cash a company will have after capital spending to pay bond and equity investors.  The figure in Europe was around zero. “It's a worry because U.S. corporates are a lot more aggressive in their financial policy, and in terms of shareholder returns, either in the form of share buybacks and special dividends, which are detrimental to bondholders,” Semaoune said.

Weak economy cuts number of South African companies paying tax,Dec 23 2019,"JOHANNESBURG () - Nearly half of companies in South Africa had no taxable income in 2017 while a quarter recorded a taxable loss, the South African Revenue service said on Monday, based on its latest 2017/18 data, highlighting the impact of weak economic growth. The revenue service said based on its 2017 data, 48.3% of companies had taxable income equal to zero, 27.4% reported an assessed loss, and 24.3% had positive taxable income. Companies have up to 12 months from the end of their financial cycles to submit tax returns. “The decline can largely be attributed to sluggish economic growth, structural challenges in some sectors of the economy, low confidence levels and political uncertainty,” the revenue service said.  “All of these factors play a role in subdued investment activity, resulting in lower profitability for companies.” In the revenue service's 2019 Tax Statistics, which measures revenue collection from 2014/15 to 2018/19 fiscal years, revenue collection for the current year ended March reached 1.287 trillion rand ($90.25 billion), short of a target of 1.302 trillion rand. The collector said companies submitting returns had fallen 36.9% to just over 2 million for the 2018/19 fiscal year, partly due to many being considered “inactive or dormant”, while only 63.4%, or 572,000, of companies expected to submit returns had complied. Tax revenues have fallen sharply in South Africa since 2015 due to weak economic growth and maladministration. In addition, nationwide electricity blackouts, forcing mines and small businesses to shut down, have put more pressure on the economy and government finances.

Bank of Italy chief defends regulator's role in Bari bank crisis,Dec 23 2019,"MILAN () - The head of Italy's central bank rebuffed criticism of its role in supervising struggling lender Banca Popolare di Bari and said in an interview published on Monday that it was ready to account for its actions. Prosecutors in the southern Italian city of Bari are investigating the former cooperative bank's chairman for alleged corruption in relation to the central bank's supervisory activity, a judicial source said on Sunday. The Bank of Italy put Popolare di Bari, the biggest lender in the poorer south of the country, under special administration this month and Rome has agreed measures worth up to 900 million euros ($997 million) to prop up the unlisted bank.  “Banking supervision has accomplished its duties with the highest effort and, in my opinion, positively,” Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco told Il Corriere della Sera newspaper in an interview published on Monday. “We are ready to account for our actions, as we have always done, at an institutional level,” he said. The country's banking crisis has shone a spotlight on the Bank of Italy's supervisory role and the ruling 5-Star Movement has called for a reform of the how the central bank's top managers are appointed. Visco said the central bank would, however, assess whether it had made mistakes - when asked about Popolare di Bari's takeover of struggling rival Tercas in 2014. Critics say the deal accelerated Popolare de Bari's problems by increasing its portfolio of bad loans. Popolare di Bari's rescue is the latest episode in a string of banking crises to hit Italy since 2015, costing the state and other Italian banks some 23 billion euros. Visco said some small banks in Italy were still “weak” and the Bank of Italy was closely monitoring them. “The problem is that we have an insufficient crisis management system. To manage a crisis you don't just need to be able to forecast it, you need tools,” he said, without specifying what tools he was referring to. “I've been asking for a long time for new rules to be established at the European level” he said.  The Bank of Italy was not immediately available for comment. Visco said the rescue plan for Popolare di Bari - which involves a depositor guarantee fund financed by Italian banks and state-owned Banca del Mezzogiorno-Mediocredito Centrale - aims to prevent depositors and bond holders losing money. But he suggested the cooperative bank's 69,000 shareholders, who are mostly retail investors, could book losses. “The industrial plan will define the amount needed for new capital, the way to carry it out and the involvement of current shareholders,” Visco said. He said the plan would be open to other banks willing to join a larger financial entity with an adequate size for the “new technological and competitive environment”.

SoftBank's $3 billion WeWork financing talks stall with Japan banks: sources,Dec 23 2019,"TOKYO () - SoftBank Group Corp's talks to secure $3 billion from Japan's three biggest banks have stalled as the lenders have hit internal lending limits to the firm, two people said, complicating a $9.5 billion rescue package for WeWork. The Japanese technology conglomerate is now likely to enter the new year without the WeWork financing in place, the people said, adding the banks are also concerned about the risks involved in rescuing the U.S. office-sharing startup. Mizuho Financial Group Inc, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (MUFG) and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc (SMFG) are seeking ways to provide the financing while offsetting exposure, the people said, declining to be identified because the information is not public. SoftBank did not respond to a request for comment. Mizuho, MUFG and SMFG declined to comment.  One option is to use some of SoftBank's 26% stake in Chinese e-commerce major Alibaba Group Holding Ltd as collateral, the people said.  “SoftBank is an important client so we want to do everything we can to help, but we have to consider our credit risk,” said a senior banker. The talks illustrate the difficulty SoftBank poses for Japan's banks. Founder Masayoshi Son's tech juggernaut has long been a lucrative source of corporate lending in the world's third-largest economy, where banks typically have to lend at ultra-low interest rates given years of deflation. But SoftBank's growing debt and turmoil at major bet WeWork earlier this year also highlight the firm's higher risk profile.  “Banks cannot loosen their credit criteria only for SoftBank,” said S&P Global Ratings senior director Ryoji Yoshizawa.  Another option to spread the risk is a syndicated loan, Yoshizawa said, adding this would be time-consuming - potentially delaying financing. SoftBank in October said it would launch a $9.5 billion bailout of WeWork after the cancellation of the startup's initial public offering due to investor concerns over its corporate governance and co-founder Adam Neumann's hard-partying ways. Son has said he turned a blind eye to Neumann's management, but that the company is still a solid business. The domestic bank deadlock led SoftBank to secure a $1.75 billion line of credit from Goldman Sachs Group Inc, the people said. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. SoftBank has 5.5 trillion yen ($50.28 billion) in outstanding bonds and another 4 trillion yen in bank loans, Refinitiv data showed. Its weighted average cost of debt is 3.7%, the seventh-highest among all companies on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average. Moody's calculations showed the conglomerate's interest coverage ratio is 1.3, meaning group income is enough to service its debt, with some left over.

RPT-UPDATE 1-ICBC Standard aborts plan to shut base metals unit,Dec 23 2019,"(Repeats story that ran late on Friday, with no changes to text) By Florence Tan and Pratima Desai SINGAPORE/LONDON, Dec 20 () - ICBC Standard Bank has abandoned proposals to shut its base metals business and instead plans to merge it with the precious metals unit to cut costs, the bank told  in an emailed statement. The bank, a joint venture between Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Africa's largest lender Standard Bank, is a major participant in base metals markets globally. It is restructuring after posting a net loss of almost $130 million in first-half 2019 and in early November mooted the idea of cutting jobs and shutting its base metals trading and equities businesses. “Following feedback from our clients and shareholders, we will be maintaining our base metals capabilities, whilst achieving some operating efficiencies by merging our precious and base metals business lines,” ICBC Standard Bank said. A staff memo dated Dec. 9 seen by  and sources with direct knowledge of the matter said the U-turn came after objections from majority shareholder ICBC, which controls 60% of ICBC Standard Bank. One source said the attraction for ICBC when it bought into the joint venture in 2015 was the base metals business, which includes trading derivatives and physical markets, and trade finance. The memo stated that the bank still planned to close its equities business. “The discussions have not resulted in any change to the equities proposed closure,” it said, adding that the bank will proceed with efforts to cut costs and headcount. ICBC Standard Bank decline to comment directly on the memo. When ICBC invested in Standard's commodities business, the South African lender had built up the strongest physical presence among Western banks in China and was an active member of the London Metal Exchange. Late in 2017, ICBC Standard hired Tim Wilson to build the business. Wilson had previously run Standard Chartered's commodity marketing and sales business out of Singapore and worked for JPMorgan. However, in its mid-year 2019 financial report, ICBC Standard said its base metals business had underperformed, hit by the impact of the U.S.-China trade on markets. “They've extended the period for making people redundant by between three and six months, depending on their function,” one source with direct knowledge of the matter said. “This gives them the option to keep people on depending on what they decide to do with base metals, what shape the new (business) offering might take.” ","{'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.919, 'pos': 0.049, 'compound': 0.8225}",0.8225

"Abenomics sputters as trade damage spreads, tax revenues undershoot",Dec 23 2019,"TOKYO () - Japan's “Abenomics” stimulus program appears to be reaching a turning point as growth is sputtering and the hit to exports from slowing global demand is spreading to various sectors of the economy. The slowdown makes it more likely that the government and central bank will need to devise novel ways to stimulate growth in the world's third-largest economy in 2020, although they are hampered by a near-empty policy arsenal. Analysts don't expect a fourth-quarter contraction to be a major catastrophe as long as a fragile Sino-U.S. trade truce lasts. But the signs that the economy is cooling after a year of expansion threaten Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's goal of achieving both economic revival and fiscal consolidation through a policy mix of monetary easing, flexible spending and structural reform. Policymakers have argued that the domestic economy remains shielded from the heavy blow to exports and factory activity from declining external demand. But analysts question whether the divergence between the manufacturing sector and the broader economy can last, as sliding sales of cars and at department stores suggest policymakers may have overestimated the strength of consumer demand. “There is always a link between the manufacturing economy and the domestic economy. Ultimately, the weakness of one will spill over into the other,” said Steve Cochrane, chief APAC economist at Moody's Analytics. To be sure, Abe's reflationary policy has helped boost gross domestic product to 540 trillion yen ($4.9 trillion), up 8.6% from 2012 levels, thanks to a windfall yen weakness boosting exporters' profits and share prices.  But a string of data shows that domestic demand is weakening and labor market conditions are loosening. Department store sales fell much more than expected in October after a nationwide tax hike kicked in that month. The fall was 1.5 times as large as in the month of the previous tax hike, in April 2014. (For an interactive graphic of department store sales, click: ) New car sales were still reeling from a post-sales tax hike pullback in demand in November, sliding 13% compared with the same month in the previous year. They had already nearly recovered in the same time period after the 2014 tax hike. (For an interactive graphic of new car sales, click: ) Declines in car production due to weaker demand both abroad and at home and a powerful typhoon pushed down factory output too, which shrank at its fastest pace in nearly two years in October. A stagnation in output is already leading to an easing of conditions in the job market for manufacturers, the Bank of Japan's December “tankan” survey showed. If the labor market eases further, wage growth will weaken and that will threaten a key driver behind consumer spending, a government official said. “It will be a red light (for the economy) if first-quarter growth is bad,” the official added. The weakening of the economy is taking its toll on the state's already dire finances, causing tax revenue to undershoot official estimates after seven years of growth. Despite the sales tax hike and the near 30% rise in tax revenue from 2012 levels to above 60 trillion yen, officials say Abe is set to miss his latest revenue target. That would mark a setback for his strategy of counting on higher tax income as well as the BOJ's low-rate policy to rein in a growing debt that's over twice the size of Japan's $5 trillion economy. (For an interactive graphic on Japan's state finances, click: ) But losing the ability to both raise spending and curb debt and warnings of credit downgrades will further cloud the outlook for Abe's stimulus. “Indications that the government is unable to take measures that would mitigate the long-term economic and fiscal costs related to an ageing society would likely prompt a downgrade,” credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service warned in a report last month. Further straining finances, Japan has slashed its tax income estimate for the current fiscal year by more than 2 trillion yen from its initial target as the export slump caused by the 17-month-long Sino-U.S. trade war hit receipts. To compensate for the shortfall, the government will issue additional deficit covering bonds worth 2.2 trillion yen in an extra budget for this fiscal year. A government official shrugged off weakening tax revenue as a one-off, saying that tax income should return to steady growth in the near future. Japanese policymakers remain complacent about the country's fiscal situation, reflecting a global trend toward shifting away from monetary to fiscal stimulus, with limited room left for monetary stimulus to battle any future financial crisis. “We have to strive to achieve both economic growth and fiscal reform at the same time,” former economy minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, a member of Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told . “That is the only way we can achieve fiscal reform.” ","{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.081, 'compound': -0.836}",-0.836
Egypt reinstates information ministry in cabinet portfolio reshuffle,Dec 22 2019,"CAIRO () - Egypt will reinstate the country's information ministry and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has put the prime minister directly in charge of the government's investment portfolio, in a cabinet reshuffle approved by parliament on Sunday. Osama Haikal, who served as information minister from 2011 to 2012, will return as minister of state for information affairs, according to the plans confirmed by Sisi's office. Egypt had abolished its Information Ministry in 2014. It did not say what would be the main responsibilities of the ministry, which rights groups say was a symbol of censorship under the rule of Hosni Mubarak.  Sisi has already set up a new regulatory agency to oversee output from the entertainment and news industries, with the power to fine or suspend publications and broadcasters.  Human rights organizations and the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists have repeatedly criticized media freedoms in Egypt, which jailed the third most journalists of any country in the world this year, the CPJ said this month.   In the reshuffle, which had been rumored for weeks, Sisi left key portfolios like defense, interior, finance and foreign affairs unchanged but gave Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly direct oversight of the investment and administrative reform portfolios. The investment portfolio will now be run through the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones, while administrative reform will come under the Central Agency for Organization and Administration, the Cabinet said in a statement. The broadening of Madbouly's role to include oversight of investment and administrative reform was out of a desire to speed up the work as it overlaps with that of many other ministries and agencies, the statement said. Barring its oil sector, Egypt has struggled to attract foreign direct investment over the past several years. Rania al-Mashat, formerly the tourism minister, will now head the International Cooperation Ministry as part of the reshuffle. That ministry was formerly the Investment and International Cooperation Ministry and was headed by Sahar Nasr, who served as international cooperation minister since 2015 and also took on the investment portfolio in 2017. Khaled al-Anany will succeed Mashat as tourism minister and also retain his existing role as antiquities minister. Hala al-Saeed will continue as planning minister but will now also oversee economic development. Her portfolio was previously planning, follow-up and administrative reform.

CORRECTED-Egypt reinstates information ministry in cabinet portfolio reshuffle,Dec 22 2019,"(Omits duties incorrectly attributed to regulatory agency in paragraph 4) CAIRO, Dec 22 () - Egypt will reinstate the country's information ministry and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has put the prime minister directly in charge of the government's investment portfolio, in a cabinet reshuffle approved by parliament on Sunday. Osama Haikal, who served as information minister from 2011 to 2012, will return as minister of state for information affairs, according to the plans announced by Sisi's office. Egypt had abolished its Information Ministry in 2014. It did not say what would be the main responsibilities of the ministry, which rights groups say was a symbol of censorship under the rule of Hosni Mubarak. Sisi has already set up a new regulatory agency to oversee output from the entertainment and news industries, with the power to fine or suspend publications and broadcasters. Human rights organisations and the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists have repeatedly criticised media freedoms in Egypt, which jailed the third most journalists of any country in the world this year, the CPJ said this month. In the reshuffle, which had been rumoured for weeks, Sisi left key portfolios like defence, interior, finance and foreign affairs unchanged but gave Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly direct oversight of the investment portfolio. It was not immediately clear if the portfolio will remain a ministry. Barring its oil sector, Egypt has struggled to attract foreign direct investment over the past several years. Rania al-Mashat, formerly the tourism minister, will now head the International Cooperation Ministry as part of the reshuffle. That ministry was formerly the Investment and International Cooperation Ministry and was headed by Sahar Nasr, who served as international cooperation minister since 2015 and also took on the investment portfolio in 2017. Khaled al-Anany will succeed Mashat as tourism minister and also retain his existing role as antiquities minister. Hala al-Saeed will continue as planning minister but will now also oversee economic development. Her portfolio was previously planning, follow-up and administrative reform. Nevine Gamea, who headed Egypt's Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency, will be the new Industry Minister, succeeding Amr Nassar.

Bulgaria's Fibank plans to raise $113 mln to boost capital,Dec 22 2019,"* Capital increase needed to help Bulgaria on path to euro * Fibank says placed 30 mln euro bond privately * Sold bad loans with nominal value of more than $305 mln SOFIA, Dec 22 () - Bulgaria's fourth largest lender First Investment Bank (Fibank) plans to raise 200 million levs ($113.3 million) to help cover a capital shortfall found by the European Central Bank as the country moves towards adopting the euro. The bank needs to increase its capital buffers after a comprehensive assessment of six Bulgarian lenders by the ECB found a capital shortfall at Fibank of 262.9 million euros ($291.2 million). The lender plans to offer 40 million new shares at 5 levs per share, it said in a statement on its website late on Friday, adding it would consider the issue a success if as few as 4 million shares were sold at the offer price. The ECB also found a capital shortfall of 51.8 million euros at smaller lender Investbank. Finance Minister Vladislav Goranov has said boosting capital at the two lenders will allow Bulgaria to enter the so-called ERM-2, a “waiting room” for the euro zone, which he expects to happen by the end of April. Fibank, whose shares traded at 2.94 levs on the Sofia bourse on Friday, said the issue price may change prior to the offering, which would affect the number of shares sold and the threshold at which it would be considered successful. The bank will prepare a prospectus for the capital increase which has to be approved by the country's financial regulator. It did not provide a timeline. Fibank, which has already secured 130 million euros ($144 million) in additional capital, said it had also privately placed a 30 million euro bond and offloaded bad loans with a nominal value of about 538 million levs ($304.8 million). It said its overall capital adequacy ratio stood at 17.65% at the end of September, while its CET1 capital ratio was 14.79%, above regulatory requirements. Bulgarian businessmen Tseko Minev and Ivaylo Mutafchiev each own 42.5% of the lender, which had total assets of 9.6 billion levs at the end of September. The remaining 15% has been floated on the Bulgarian Stock Exchange. ","{'neg': 0.018, 'neu': 0.852, 'pos': 0.13, 'compound': 0.9876}",0.9876
Second Credit Suisse spying probe expected to clear CEO Thiam: SonntagsZeitung,Dec 22 2019,"ZURICH () - A second probe into staff surveillance at Credit Suisse () is set to clear Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam, Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung reported on Sunday. Credit Suisse last week said it had initiated an investigation after a Swiss newspaper reported that its former head of human resources, Peter Goerke, was followed by private detectives in February. That revived concerns about the bank's practices after the tailing of wealth management star Iqbal Khan in September led to a scandal and upheaval in Credit Suisse's highest ranks.  An investigation ordered by the bank had concluded the surveillance on Khan — now employed by UBS () — was a one-off, organized by then-Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee and the security boss under him, both of whom resigned.  But law firm Homburger, which conducted the investigation, said deleted messages on a secure messaging platform used by Bouee and security personnel had limited the scope of the findings. Credit Suisse said on Friday the new inquiry was nearing completion, with results to be published on Monday.  SonntagsZeitung, citing unnamed sources, reported on Sunday that the investigation, also conducted by Homburger, had substantiated the claims surrounding Goerke but had so far found no evidence of further instances of shadowing, nor that CEO Thiam knew private detectives had been hired to tail the two executives. The investigation is continuing, with only interim findings to be communicated on Dec. 23, the paper reported. Credit Suisse declined to comment on the contents of the SonntagsZeitung article. A spokesman said the bank would communicate on Monday as previously announced. Finance watchdog FINMA is also examining the issue of staff surveillance at Credit Suisse and on Friday appointed an independent auditor to clarify relevant corporate governance questions. A criminal investigation into Khan's tailing — which came to a head when the wealth manager filed a police report following a confrontation with one of the detectives as he and his wife drove through Zurich — is ongoing.

"China should step up regulation of artificial intelligence in finance, think tank says",Dec 22 2019,"QINGDAO, China/BEIJING () - China should introduce a regulatory framework for artificial intelligence in the finance industry, and enhance technology used by regulators to strengthen industry-wide supervision, policy advisers at a leading think tank said on Sunday. “We should not deify artificial intelligence as it could go wrong just like any other technology,” said the former chief of China's securities regulator, Xiao Gang, who is now a senior researcher at the China Finance 40 Forum.  “The point is how we make sure it is safe for use and include it with proper supervision,” Xiao told a forum in Qingdao on China's east coast. Technology to regulate intelligent finance - referring to banking, securities and other financial products that employ technology such as facial recognition and big-data analysis to improve sales and investment returns - has largely lagged development, showed a report from the China Finance 40 Forum. Evaluation of emerging technologies and industry-wide contingency plans should be fully considered, while authorities should draft laws and regulations on privacy protection and data security, the report showed. Lessons should be learned from the boom and bust of the online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending sector where regulations were not introduced quickly enough, said economics professor Huang Yiping at the National School of Development of Peking University.  China's P2P industry was once widely seen as an important source of credit, but has lately been undermined by pyramid-scheme scandals and absent bosses, sparking public anger as well as a broader government crackdown.  “Changes have to be made among policy makers,” said Zhang Chenghui, chief of the finance research bureau at the Development Research Institute of the State Council.  “We suggest regulation on intelligent finance to be written in to the 14th five-year plan of the country's development, and each financial regulator - including the central bank, banking and insurance regulators and the securities watchdog - should appoint its own chief technology officer to enhance supervision of the sector.” Zhang also suggested the government brings together the data platforms of each financial regulatory body to better monitor potential risk and act quickly as problems arise.

Boliva's ex-president Morales plans party rally on Argentina border,Dec 22 2019,"La Paz () - Bolivian former President Evo Morales on Saturday appealed for his supporters to attend a rally on the border between Argentina and Bolivia on Dec. 29 to choose a candidate for Bolivia's  election early next year. In an interview with Argentine radio, Morales, who has sought political asylum in Argentina, said he had called the meeting of the Movement for Socialism party, which he helmed for 14 years as president. “We will choose our candidate with a view to the upcoming elections in Bolivia,” Morales told Radio La Network. An October vote to pick a new president, vice president and some national legislators was annulled because of serious irregularities detected by an international audit.  The vote-rigging scandal forced Morales to resign and leave Bolivia in mid-November.   This week, lawmakers appointed a six-member electoral tribunal, which is expected to set a date by Jan. 2 for new elections within 120 days.  The ex-president did not report the place of the meeting, but the local press suggested it could take place in the cities of Oran or Salvador Mazza, in the province of Salta, about 1,300 kilometers (808 miles) northwest of Buenos Aires. Morales said the Argentine government had agreed to provide security for the event.  The indigenous leader has been a staying in Argentina since Dec. 12, after he left Mexico, where he fled to after resigning from the presidency and under pressure from the armed forces. The former coca farmer won a fourth consecutive term in the Oct. 20 election and claimed he was ousted in a coup d'etat. Bolivian prosecutors issued an arrest warrant against him on Wednesday for the crimes of sedition, terrorism and terrorist financing, promoted by the government of Jeanine Áñez, a former senator and opponent of Morales who stepped in as interim president in November. Morales has ruled out running as a candidate himself and has named Luis Arce Catacora, his former economy minister, and Andronico Rodriguez, a key coca farmer union boss, as potential MAS presidential candidates.

Mexican president pitches bigger role for state power generation,Dec 22 2019,"MEXICO CITY () - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised in a speech on Saturday to dramatically expand state-run electricity company CFE's power generation business if private power companies do not boost their investments in the sector.  Lopez Obrador, a leftist who has long-favored more robust state control over oil and power industries, said the CFE's share of Mexican power generation market could grow to as much as 70% from about 56% currently by the end of his term in 2024. “If the private sector doesn't invest, we'll do it ourselves. We may end my term with 60 or 70 percent of market production coming through the CFE,” he said in the speech at one of the company's new natural gas-fueled plants in western Michoacan state. Lopez Obrador also pledged to boost CFE finances with a  restructuring of its debt, but did not specify an amount or a timeline.  Nearing the end of his first year in office, Lopez Obrador has shifted sharply away from some of the business-friendly policies embraced by his predecessor, centrist President Enrique Pena Nieto, who enacted a sweeping energy market liberalization in 2013. While Lopez Obrador has said he would not seek to constitutionally reverse the reforms, he has canceled competitive oil and power auctions since he took office late last year.

"Nord Stream 2 to press on with Europe gas pipe, despite U.S. sanctions",Dec 21 2019,"MOSCOW () - The group behind Nord Stream 2 said on Saturday it aimed to complete a pipeline to boost Russian gas supplies to Europe as soon as possible, after U.S. sanctions prompted a major contractor to suspend pipe-laying activities. U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill on Friday that included legislation imposing sanctions on firms laying pipe for Nord Stream 2, which seeks to double gas capacity along the northern Nord Stream pipeline route to Germany. Washington, which has been seeking to sell more of its own liquefied natural gas (LNG) to European states, has said Nord Stream 2 will make Europe too reliant on Russian supplies. Gazprom, Russia's state-controlled gas giant and a major backer of Nord Stream 2, already supplies more than a third of Europe's gas needs. The company declined to comment. Nord Stream 2 will help Russia bypass Ukraine, the main route for Russian gas. Moscow and Kiev, which have been at loggerheads over Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, agreed a new transit deal this week after long-running talks. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will run along the Baltic Sea floor, was expected to start up in the first half of 2020. “Completing the project is essential for European supply security. We together with the companies supporting the project will work on finishing the pipeline as soon as possible,” Nord Stream 2 said on Saturday. It did not provide details. German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said Berlin “firmly rejects” U.S. sanctions but would not retaliate. Nord Stream 2 contractor, Swiss-Dutch company Allseas, announced on Friday it had suspended pipe-laying activities. The company said it would “proceed, consistent with the legislation's wind down provision” and said it expected guidance on the regulatory, technical and environmental issues from the U.S. authority. Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday that Moscow “will continue to implement its economic projects regardless of anyone's sanctions.” A senior Russian senator also said the Nord Stream 2 must stick to its schedule. Russia and Ukraine, embroiled in a political row and legal disputes, agreed their new gas transit deal shortly before the existing pact expires at the end of this year. Moscow had initially insisted on a short-term agreement to run until Nord Stream 2 came on stream. Ukraine, which earns hefty revenues from gas transit fees, wanted a long-term deal. Moscow and Kiev said on Saturday the new deal would last at least five years and could be extended for a further 10. They said it would include increased gas transport fees and set out gas volumes to be booked for transit through Ukraine. Nord Stream 2, which aims to double the Nord Stream route's existing capacity of 55 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas a year, is owned by Gazprom, which is financing half of the project worth about 9.5 billion euros ($10.5 billion). Other partners in Nord Stream 2 are Austria's OMV (), the German firms Uniper () and Wintershall (), Anglo-Dutch energy major Royal Dutch Shell () and France's Engie ().

PG&E creditors offer California wildfire victims $13.5 billion in cash upfront,Dec 21 2019,"() - PG&E Corp's () creditors have sweetened their offer to California wildfire victims, saying they are now prepared to pay $13.5 billion in cash upfront, according to a letter sent on Friday to state governor Gavin Newsom. Current terms of the settlement deal, approved by a U.S. bankruptcy judge on Tuesday, call for half of the settlement to be financed with stock in a newly reorganized PG&E. In the letter, the bondholders led by Elliott Management said their latest proposals will make sure individual victims “are prioritized, as they should be” and will address demands Newsom had raised earlier. Newsom said on Dec. 13 that the settlement had lacked major changes in governance and tougher safety enforcement mechanisms mandated under the state wildfire statute. It would also leave the company with a weakened capital structure and “limited ability to withstand future financial and operational headwinds.” The new plan calls for no debt at the reorganized holding company and a new board with residents from California forming the majority of directors.  It also allows for a takeover of PG&E by the state if the company is found to have caused any single future wildfire that destroys more than 5,000 structures.  PG&E said after the disclosure of the letter that it is continuing to talk with the stakeholders. Newsom's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment after business hours on Friday. PG&E said earlier it had reached a deal with labor, safety and customer advocacy groups calling for regulators to allow PG&E to implement some rate increases for funding wildfire-prevention efforts and safety improvements. A term sheet submitted with Friday's letter showed utility customer rate increases will be capped at 3% through 2023. PG&E filed for Chapter 11 protection in January, citing potential liabilities in excess of $30 billion from deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018 linked to its equipment. It came under renewed criticism this year for precautionary power outages to guard against the risk of wildfires posed by extremely dry and windy weather.

German finance minister: tax on share dealing could be extended to other assets,Dec 21 2019,"BERLIN () - The financial transaction tax on share dealing that 10 European countries hope to introduce from 2021 could be extended to cover trading in riskier assets, German finance minister Olaf Scholz said. Scholz's plan for a tax of 0.2% of the transaction value of purchases of shares in large companies was widely criticized when floated this month, with critics angered that it excluded the volatile, leveraged instruments that they believe drive market instability. But Scholz told the Funke newspaper consortium in an interview to be published on Saturday that extending the tax to other asset classes would require a broader European consensus. “If experiences with the introduction are positive then it will be easier to achieve that consensus,” he was quoted as saying. Apart from Germany, which wants to use the tax to finance a 1.5 billion euro plan for a minimum pension, the countries that plan to introduce the tax are Austria, Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain. Separately, Scholz told the newspaper that he hoped to secure agreement with Germany's states for an agreement that would relieve heavily indebted municipalities of their most crippling debts, freeing them to invest again. Some 2,500 municipalities, mainly in north-western Germany, would be affected by the measure, which would see the federal government joining forces with the states in which the communes were located to assume some 20 billion euros in debt. While the low interest rate environment was favorable for such a measure, Scholz said he needed the acquiescence of wealthier states like Bavaria, which did not need the debt relief. “In federal states it's sometimes like a family, where one child complains when the other gets a new jacket,” Scholz said. “We can only find a good answer if the states that don't have difficulties don't insist on getting something.” With Germany's economy cooling markedly after a decade-long boom, Scholz has faced pressure to clear the way for stimulus spending, something he has been reluctant to do.

U.S. Steel delivers unwelcome Christmas surprise to Michigan town,Dec 21 2019,"CHICAGO () - The mayor of a Michigan steel town was attending his grandchildren's Christmas play Thursday evening when he got an unwelcome voicemail from an official of the town's top employer: United States Steel Corp ().  U.S. Steel was about to send out a press release announcing layoffs for 1,545 workers and the idling of a significant portion of operations at the Great Lakes Works facility, according to the voicemail received by Michael Bowdler, mayor of River Rouge, a city of 7,500 that sits on the Detroit River roughly 10 miles south of Detroit. In the voicemail to Bowdler, heard by , the U.S. Steel official called the layoffs “terrible news” and attributed the decision to weak demand, lower steel prices and new corporate strategy. Domestic steel prices, after rising in the immediate aftermath of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on steel imports, have fallen amid weakening demand from the auto and other manufacturing sectors.  In the 2016 presidential election, Trump won Michigan by less than 11,000 votes. But with its factories shedding thousands of jobs, the state is seen as up for grabs in the 2020 election. Steel production at Great Lakes Works will stop around April 1 and the hot-strip mill rolling facility will cease operations before the end of next year, U.S. Steel said in its statement released on Thursday. Production will be shifted to Gary Works in Indiana, the statement added. The latest layoffs, which would impact 94% of the Michigan facility's workforce, come months after U.S. Steel decided to temporarily lay off 48 employees at Great Lakes Works and warned of up to 200 more layoffs.  The Great Lakes plant primarily serves the automotive industry. It is the lifeline of the cities of Ecorse and River Rouge, which house the plant. Local officials had worked out a deal to give tax breaks to the company for a $600 million investment to carry out upgrades at Great Lakes Works. They thought the investment was the company's commitment to stay invested in the towns. In September, a U.S. Steel spokeswoman told  that the incentives would help preserve jobs in the region. After Thursday's developments, Bowdler did not know whether the tax deal would be put before the city council for approval. U.S. Steel told  on Friday that its discussions with the two cities about the tax deal were “paused” earlier this year. Bowdler said the company's move will result in a $1 million hit on the city's finances and could also dampen the business of its retailers. U.S. Steel's new strategy to ramp up investments at three mills in North America - Mon Valley plant in Pennsylvania, Gary Works in Indiana and Big River Steel in Arkansas, which the company expects to fully acquire within the next four years -  had thrown into doubt the future of the Michigan plant. Martin Englert, a steel industry analyst for brokerage firm Jefferies LLC, called the idling of Great Lakes an “incremental positive” for the company. U.S. Steel's stock closed down Friday about 11% at $11.91 as the company announced a dividend cut and forecast a wider-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter. The company's shares have plunged 75% since March 1, 2018, when Trump announced his decision to crack down on foreign steel imports. Prices of hot-rolled coil are down 41% from their 2018 peak, hurting the profits of American steel companies. U.S. Steel, which saw a record profit in 2018 on soaring steel prices, reported a loss in the latest quarter on slowing demand.

Facebook says group used computer-generated faces to push pro-Trump message,Dec 21 2019,"SAN FRANCISCO () - Facebook Inc () has taken down a well-financed campaign that used dozens of artificially generated faces to spread pro-Trump and anti-Chinese government messages, the company and outside researchers said on Friday. Researchers from New York-based Graphika and the Digitial Forensics Research Lab, an arm of the Washington-based Atlantic Council, said it was the first time they had seen the large-scale use of computer-generated faces to spread disinformation on social media. The researchers said in a report  that while tell-tale signs such as misshapen ears and distorted backgrounds had helped them identify the fakes, ""this technology is rapidly evolving toward generating more believable pictures."" Facebook said  610 Facebook accounts, 89 Pages, 156 Groups and 72 Instagram accounts were involved in the network. The social media giant said those behind the operation had spent upward of $9 million on advertising to promote their content, which touched on hot-button issues such as ""impeachment, conservative ideology, political candidates, elections, trade, family values and freedom of religion."" The amount is almost 100 times what Facebook said  Russia's infamous troll farm spent in the run-up to and shortly after the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Facebook said its investigation linked the activity to U.S.-based Epoch Media Group and individuals in Vietnam working on its behalf, though the accounts more openly associated with The BL, for the Beauty of Life. In a statement, Epoch said it had “no connection with the website BL.” ""The BL was founded by a former employee, and employs some of our former employees,"" publisher Stephen Gregory said in a post  to the Epoch Times website. He called on Facebook to withdraw its allegation and lift a pre-existing ban on Epoch Media's advertising. Facebook fired back, saying that BL executives “were active admins on Epoch Media Group Pages as recently as this morning when their accounts were deactivated and the BL was removed.” The BL, whose website lists its headquarters as a single-family home in Middletown, New York, did not immediately return emails seeking comment. Its listed phone number rang unanswered. The Epoch Times was set up as a print publication by followers of the Falun Gong spiritual movement, banned in China, before moving heavily online. Its output has tended to steer toward support for Trump and attacks on his opponents. The content removed by Facebook had the same tilt. Groups identified by the outside researchers bore names such as “America Needs President Trump,” “TRUMP MAGA 2020,” or “WE STAND WITH TRUMP & PENCE!” “Alongside pro-Trump material, these assets posted large quantities of material attacking his critics and rivals, often presenting users with a partisan statement and urging them to respond if they agreed,” the researchers wrote in their report. The BL's now-removed Facebook page said it would “focus on content that represents fundamental moral standards and values, to enlighten all who prefer to be inspired,” according to the researchers. While the page said it rejected misinformation, Facebook said, “The BL-focused network repeatedly violated a number of our policies, including our policies against coordinated inauthentic behavior, spam and misrepresentation.” The takedown followed investigative stories by NBC on the Epoch Times' heavy use  of Facebook and by the fact-checking website Snopes.com  on The BL.

In a court filing, the FTC asked a federal judge in Georgia to stop FleetCor and Chief Executive Officer Ronald Clarke, from charging hidden fees and to disgorge ill-gotten gains. In its complaint, the FTC said that FleetCor had marketed payment cards to companies with fleets of vehicles, promising that they would save money, that there would be fraud controls, and that there were no membership or transaction fees.  But it said that after customers had signed up, FleetCor charged them “at least hundreds of millions of dollars in unexpected fees.” FleetCor said in a statement that it disagreed with the FTC, adding the “complaint is based upon fundamental misconceptions of the company, its customers and its products.” The company said its customer disclosures are “clear and communicated repeatedly, and that its customers are “sophisticated businesses who read their contracts, invoices and reports.”       J.P. Morgan estimated in an analyst note that the disputed fees were likely less than 3% of revenue. When customers noticed the charges and complained to FleetCor, the company removed the charges, and “in many instances FleetCor has begun charging these customers for different fees to make up the difference,” the FTC said in its complaint. The FTC also accused the company of billing customers for interest, finance charges and programs to which they had not consented. The FTC said that tens of thousands of customers had complained to government agencies and/or the Better Business Bureau. The company's share price closed up 0.5 percent.

Debt refinancings stall key asset sale by Chesapeake Energy,Dec 21 2019,"HOUSTON () - Natural gas producer Chesapeake Energy Corp, which last month warned it could default on its debt, has slowed talks on a deal to sell $1 billion in assets as it scrambles to restructure debt. An earlier plan to cut debt through cash flow from expanding oil operations and asset sales ran headlong into a drop in commodity prices and rising investor resistance to new financing for oil and gas companies. On Friday, however, the shale gas pioneer completed a term-loan refinancing early with support by 99% of holders.  Chesapeake also is refinancing longer-dated notes that will pare $1 billion off its about $9.7 billion in debt by paying the bond holders between 62 cents and 70 cents per dollar on the older notes.      But the refinancings have sidelined an about $1 billion deal to sell gas assets in Louisiana to Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones' Comstock Resources Inc, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Expectations for an agreement have been pushed into 2020 from this month, the person said. Chesapeake and Comstock declined to comment. “They're pulling the levers at their disposal,” said Jake Leiby, a high-yield energy analyst at researcher CreditSights Inc, referring to the refinancings. “They certainly have wood to chop” to further reduce the debt load. The shale pioneer borrowed billions of dollars to acquire and drill properties but has struggled to pay off debt with gas prices around $2.30 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), down from more than $13 in 2008. Last month, Chesapeake pledged to cut spending by 30% and warned of a possible default next year if prices do not improve. It may resort to a reverse stock split to increase the price of its sub-$1 shares up enough to retain a New York Stock Exchange listing.   Energy consultancy IHS Markit projects U.S. gas prices next year will average below $2 per mmBTU, falling to the lowest since 1995. Chesapeake's latest offer will replace $3.2 billion of unsecured debt with $2.2 billion of secured debt. The debt exchange will lower its total debt, and “buy time” for continued asset sale and increased oil production, said John Thieroff, a senior credit analyst at Moody's Investor Service. But that refinancing does not reduce next year's interest burden, which remains about $750 million. “As gas fundamentals continue to weaken and stay soft, they're exposed to that,” said Thieroff.

"Latvia fines Sweden's SEB over anti-money laundering controls, sanction violation",Dec 21 2019,"RIGA, Dec 20 () - Latvia's financial watchdog said on Friday it had fined Swedish bank SEB a total of 1.79 million euros ($1.99 million)for lax anti-money laundering controls and for one case of violation of sanctions in the Baltic country. The Financial and Capital Market Commission (FCMC) said an inspection in 2017 of SEB Latvia had showed the bank needed to improve internal control systems for the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing. A 2019 inspection had showed a case of “shortcomings in complying with Sanction Law”, it said in a statement. SEB said in a separate statement the violation of sanctions related to a client that was a subsidiary to a company added to the EU sanctions list after the subsidiary became a client. The third-largest lender in Latvia said it had worked on an action plan where alleged shortcomings were addressed. “SEB Latvia commits to take further actions to strengthen the bank's processes, systems and routines,” it said. The FCMC said the size of the fine reflected its view the money laundering and terrorism financing risk level characterising SEB's clients and services was low. Latvia has fined a number of banks for slack anti-money laundering controls as it tries to clean up its banking sector following several scandals, before undergoing a review next year by Moneyval, the money laundering and terrorism financing body of the Council of Europe. Among scandals, bank ABLV was closed last year after U.S. authorities accused it of money laundering. Outgoing central bank governor Ilmars Rimsevics is fighting charges of bribery and money laundering. ","{'neg': 0.133, 'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.051, 'compound': -0.9783}",-0.9783
Breakingviews - Review: Bloomberg primer goes beyond hagiography,Dec 21 2019,"NEW YORK ( Breakingviews) - The telephone's caller ID made clear the boss was on the line. “It's Mike,” said Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder of the firm that carried his name and paid my salary. “You say stocks are mixed, but I have the Dow Jones down 40 points. That's not mixed.” One response could've been to argue that while the Dow was indeed down, it was due to one or two large components in the average — and that the S&P 500 Index, a better measure of the equity market anyway, was flat to up. The other was to explain that when the story was filed to the bank of editors charged with publishing the stocks report, the Dow was closer to “unch” (Wall Street for unchanged) than down. But even for someone who'd just joined Bloomberg LP back in 1993, it was widely understood that's not how the place worked. There would be no pushing back. The anecdote imparted two important lessons. First, Mike Bloomberg cares deeply about the product bearing his name. And two, he doesn't much care for traditional boundaries. He bypassed the editorial chain of command completely to lodge his complaint with the young writer whose byline appeared on the story. Judging by Eleanor Randolph's “The Many Lives of Michael Bloomberg,” many people have similar yarns to tell about their interactions with the Wall Street information tycoon. Not entirely unlike the man he wants to unseat as U.S. president, Donald Trump, Bloomberg is used to getting his way, even if it means abandoning norms. Look no further than his unconventional plan to win the Democratic nomination by bypassing the first four states to hold primaries, heading straight for Super Tuesday in March, when multiple states each pick their favorite in a single day. Trump and Bloomberg may share some similarities in their views about process. But the differences in what they've achieved over seven decades are more noteworthy. The far richer Bloomberg's more recent reversal of his decision not to run for the Oval Office has given relevancy to Randolph's biography. Had Bloomberg stuck to simply writing checks — a skill in which he's particularly adept — “The Many Lives” might've just sat on the bookshelves of a few political junkies and friends of Mike. Even without this last unfolding chapter, the book captures its subject: He's a profane technocrat with healthy self-regard who solves problems that often benefit the public good. Bloomberg's rivals will find little to aid their opposition research teams. It's more a chronological catalog of Bloomberg's achievements as entrepreneur, mayor of America's biggest city, and a leading philanthropist than a critical takedown of the man, who assisted Randolph in the reporting process. Bloomberg's successes suggest a man who was not only in the right place at the right time but understood how to profit from challenges that might have wilted others. When the Johns Hopkins- and Harvard-educated son of a dairy bookkeeper was relegated to the back office at Salomon Brothers, for instance, he became an expert on how computers would transform Wall Street trading. Later, when fired by Salomon with a $10 million payout, he recruited former colleagues from the firm and started the company that would eventually become Bloomberg LP, today worth some $60 billion and a competitor to Breakingviews parent Thomson . His prescience for how information technology could transform price discovery of fixed-income and other financial assets came at the start of a three-decade bull run in the bond market. Later, when he hired a Wall Street Journal reporter who had written glowingly about Bloomberg and his terminal, he entered the news business and rode the 1990s stock-market rally to new heights. His turn to politics also came at a difficult moment, as New York was reeling from Sept. 11. A Republican at the time, he rode the coattails of his predecessor Rudolph Giuliani to City Hall. Once there, his political affiliation – he later shifted to independent and now to Democrat - was of little consequence as Bloomberg focused on reforms that altered the physical landscape, and physique, of the city. Much of Randolph's book focuses on Bloomberg's historic run as mayor. His wins included a smoking ban later copied by big cities everywhere, and which extended the life expectancy of New Yorkers; a massive expansion of bike lanes; a war on unhealthy trans fats; and the creation of a world-class technical satellite of Cornell University. Bloomberg also created the first effective political opposition to the National Rifle Association by uniting mayors who deal with the daily horrors of gun violence. On the losses side, Bloomberg failed to win a bid for the Olympics or to introduce congestion pricing, though he sowed the seeds for an introduction after he left office. He didn't significantly reduce homelessness and poverty rates. More troubling was his police department's policy to “stop and frisk” individuals suspected of carrying firearms. Though the homicide rate decreased, critics including his successor considered it a violation of civil liberties. It's a mark on his record that will likely hamper his bid for African-American votes in the presidential contest. The global financial crisis of 2008 gave Bloomberg the impetus for a third term as mayor. After all, he could argue, who better to confront the once-in-a-generation hit to the most important industry to the city than a creature of Wall Street? As it was for Fiorello La Guardia and Ed Koch, Bloomberg's third term was arguably less impactful than the previous two, but Randolph makes a case that work done after 2008 helped to reduce the city's dependence on finance longer term. After leaving City Hall, Bloomberg's philanthropic efforts, as told by Randolph, particularly on progressive issues including climate change and gun violence, have given him wider name recognition beyond the five boroughs and a network of grassroots support that will aid his run for the White House. But as a recent controversial edict from his news organization — to limit its coverage of Bloomberg's Democratic opponents, but not of Trump — suggests, he's still more or less the same guy complaining about the stock market story a quarter century ago.

Canadian retail sales decline revives Bank of Canada rate cut bets,Dec 21 2019,"OTTAWA () - Canadian retail sales plummeted unexpectedly in October, the latest in a series of disappointing economic data releases that analysts say could force the Bank of Canada to consider a rate cut. Statistics Canada said on Friday that retail trade dropped by 1.2% on lower sales of motor vehicles and parts. Analysts in a  poll had forecast a gain of 0.5%. The Bank of Canada, which has kept its overnight interest rate unchanged for more than a year even as several of its international counterparts eased, projected a 1.3% increase in domestic fourth quarter growth in October. Yet the growth data so far has been underwhelming, analysts said on Friday. “The weakness of GDP growth in the fourth quarter will clearly concern policymakers and means that we can't completely rule out an insurance interest rate cut in the new year,” said Stephen Brown, a senior Canada economist with Capital Economics. Chances of a cut over the coming year, which had dwindled in recent weeks, jumped to nearly 50% from about 25% before the data, the overnight index swaps market indicated. BOCWATCH Lower sales were reported in 8 of 11 subsectors, representing 81% of retail trade. The Canadian dollar weakened as much as 0.4% to 1.3181 to the U.S dollar, giving up its gains for the week. “Apparently, Canadians were in no mood to spend in October,” said CIBC Capital Markets Senior Economist Royce Mendes in a note to clients. Recent releases, he said, “are likely enough for central bankers to at least begin discussing again whether easier financial conditions will be warranted in 2020”. Statistics Canada data earlier this week showed wholesale trade fell 1.1% in October on weaker sales of machinery equipment and supplies, while factory sales fell 0.7%. When Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced on Monday that budget deficits would be larger than forecast for the next five years, he said the economy was doing well. Canada shed an unexpected 71,200 jobs in November, the biggest decline since 2009, while the national unemployment rate rose to 5.9%, the highest in more than a year. “The numbers will keep concerns alive that the domestic Canadian economic growth backdrop has lost its footing somewhat at the end of the year,” said RBC Senior Economist Nathan Janzen in a note, especially given the softer employment data. In a separate release, Statistics Canada said new home prices unexpectedly fell 0.1% in November. ","{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.095, 'compound': 0.8957}",0.8957

"Abenomics sputters as trade damage spreads, tax revenues undershoot",Dec 23 2019,"TOKYO () - Japan's ""Abenomics"" stimulus programme appears to be reaching a turning point as growth is sputtering and the hit to exports from slowing global demand is spreading to various sectors of the economy. The slowdown makes it more likely that the government and central bank will need to devise novel ways to stimulate growth in the world's third-largest economy in 2020, although they are hampered by a near-empty policy arsenal. Analysts don't expect a fourth-quarter contraction to be a major catastrophe as long as a fragile Sino-United States trade truce lasts. But the signs that the economy is cooling after a year of expansion threaten Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's goal of achieving both economic revival and fiscal consolidation through a policy mix of monetary easing, flexible spending and structural reform. Policymakers have argued that the domestic economy remains shielded from the heavy blow to exports and factory activity from declining external demand. But analysts question whether the divergence between the manufacturing sector and the broader economy can last, as sliding sales of cars and at department stores suggest policymakers may have overestimated the strength of consumer demand. ""There is always a link between the manufacturing economy and the domestic economy. Ultimately, the weakness of one will spill over into the other,"" said Steve Cochrane, chief Apac economist at Moody's Analytics. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  To be sure, Abe's reflationary policy has helped boost gross domestic product to 540 trillion yen (US$4.9 trillion), up 8.6 per cent from 2012 levels, thanks to a windfall yen weakness boosting exporters' profits and share prices. But a string of data shows that domestic demand is weakening and labour market conditions are loosening. Department store sales fell much more than expected in October after a nationwide tax hike kicked in that month. The fall was 1.5 times as large as in the month of the previous tax hike, in April 2014. New car sales were still reeling from a post-sales tax hike pullback in demand in November, sliding 13 per cent compared with the same month in the previous year. They had already nearly recovered in the same time period after the 2014 tax hike. Declines in car production due to weaker demand both abroad and at home and a powerful typhoon pushed down factory output too, which shrank at its fastest pace in nearly two years in October. A stagnation in output is already leading to an easing of conditions in the job market for manufacturers, the Bank of Japan's (BOJ's) December ""tankan"" survey showed. If the labour market eases further, wage growth will weaken and that will threaten a key driver behind consumer spending, a government official said. ""It will be a red light (for the economy) if first-quarter growth is bad,"" the official added. The weakening of the economy is taking its toll on the state's already dire finances, causing tax revenue to undershoot official estimates after seven years of growth. Despite the sales tax hike and the near 30 per cent rise in tax revenue from 2012 levels to above 60 trillion yen, officials say Abe is set to miss his latest revenue target. That would mark a setback for his strategy of counting on higher tax income as well as the BOJ's low-rate policy to rein in a growing debt that's over twice the size of Japan's US$5 trillion economy. But losing the ability to both raise spending and curb debt and warnings of credit downgrades will further cloud the outlook for Abe's stimulus. ""Indications that the government is unable to take measures that would mitigate the long-term economic and fiscal costs related to an ageing society would likely prompt a downgrade,""credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service warned in a report last month. Further straining finances, Japan has slashed its tax income estimate for the current fiscal year by more than 2 trillion yen from its initial target as the export slump caused by the 17-month-long Sino-US trade war hit receipts. To compensate for the shortfall, the government will issue additional deficit covering bonds worth 2.2 trillion yen in an extra budget for this fiscal year. A government official shrugged off weakening tax revenue as a one-off, saying that tax income should return to steady growth in the near future. Japanese policymakers remain complacent about the country's fiscal situation, reflecting a global trend towards shifting away from monetary to fiscal stimulus, with limited room left for monetary stimulus to battle any future financial crisis. ""We have to strive to achieve both economic growth and fiscal reform at the same time,"" former economy minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, a member of Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told .","{'neg': 0.094, 'neu': 0.825, 'pos': 0.082, 'compound': -0.8402}",-0.8402

The quarterly survey by the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) and information services company Experian measures business sentiment among SMEs. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  It polled around 3,600 SMEs between Oct 7 and Nov 15 and looked at seven key indicators: turnover, profitability, business expansion, capital investment, hiring, capacity utilisation and access to financing. SBF chief executive Ho Meng Kit said on Monday (Dec 23): ""It's important to note that the survey was done before the United States and China came to an . ""While we hope for some stability, our companies must be prepared to grapple with continued uncertainties. It is therefore wise to take a watch-and-wait approach as the business environment in the first half of next year may continue to stay depressed."" The SBF noted that export segments like commerce and trading expect continued challenges as a result of the uncertain global economy. SMEs in this sector may struggle to raise financing as lenders might be more cautious in extending credit to a high-risk industry that can be impacted by global headwinds, the SBF said. It added: ""With no apparent end in sight for the ongoing US-China trade war, this may suggest that SMEs in this sector are tempering their investment appetites, seeking to maximise the potential of existing resources."" But the trade war is also affecting domestic segments such as retail and food and beverage. They registered the most significant decline in turnover expectations in the new survey, the SBF noted. Mr James Gothard, Experian's general manager for credit services and strategy in South-east Asia, said: ""Ongoing trade tensions have elevated uncertainties in the Asian business landscape, a development that is bound to impact export-oriented economies such as Singapore. ""Despite signs that the Singapore economy is improving, SMEs, especially in the commerce and trading and retail and food and beverage sectors, seem to be approaching the new year with caution, acknowledging the anticipated slow pace of the economy's recovery and risks arising from global uncertainties."" But manufacturing is a bright spot, registering improvements in nearly all indicators. The SBF said the figures suggest that the sector may be seeing order books stabilising in the first half of 2020. It also registered an increase in hiring expectations, possibly suggesting that companies are anticipating a need for more manpower to handle volumes over 2020. Mr Ho added: ""With economic uncertainties and global headwinds (that are) now the new normal, our SMEs cannot afford to carry on with business as usual. ""They need to continue to explore new markets which may now be more accessible and attractive with new free-trade agreements (FTA) in place such as the EU-Singapore FTA and the anticipated signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership next year.","{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.857, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': 0.7827}",0.7827
Veteran regulator to lead Bank of England through Brexit,Dec 21 2019,"LONDON • Britain's new government named Mr Andrew Bailey the next Bank of England (BOE) boss yesterday, entrusting one of the City of London's most experienced regulators with steering the world's fifth-biggest economy and its vast finance industry through Brexit. Mr Bailey worked for 30 years at the BOE, where he was central to efforts to shore up the British banking system during the global financial crisis. In 2016, he moved to his current role running the Financial Conduct Authority, which is responsible for cracking down on financial misconduct. ""Andrew was the stand-out candidate in a competitive field,"" Finance Minister Sajid Javid told reporters. ""He is the right person to lead the bank as we forge a new future outside the EU and level up opportunity across the country."" Mr Bailey, 60, said he was honoured to take over from Mr Mark Carney as head of the BOE, ""particularly at such a critical time for the nation as we leave the European Union"". Britain had delayed naming Mr Carney's successor since last year, with the country focused on Brexit - the impact of which remains a big challenge for the central bank - and on an election won by Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week. Mr Javid said Mr Bailey would serve an eight-year term as governor starting on March 16 next year. Mr Carney has agreed to delay his departure to March 15 from a previously scheduled date of Jan 31. Mr Bailey's role in containing the 2008-2009 near-meltdown of the financial sector means he is a familiar face to top officials at the United States Federal Reserve and other major central banks.

Mr Bailey's supporters say he knows how to use the BOE's sweeping powers without alienating London's powerful bankers, but critics have accused him of pulling his punches when it came to punishing miscreants in the industry. Mr Bailey beat other candidates seen as more likely to get the BOE's top job - and its advertised annual salary of £480,000 (S$848,000) - including another former deputy governor, Ms Minouche Shafik, who now heads the London School of Economics.","{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.871, 'pos': 0.072, 'compound': -0.3395}",-0.3395
Dubai's Emaar to sell view from world's tallest tower Burj Khalifa: Sources,Dec 23 2019,"DUBAI () - Emaar Properties is selling the observation decks of the world's tallest skyscraper the Burj Khalifa, four sources told , potentially raising US$1 billion for Dubai's biggest developer amid a real estate downturn.

Emaar, in which the Dubai government has a minority stake of 29.2 per cent, and Standard Chartered declined to comment. At over 828 metres, the Burj Khalifa is twice as tall as New York's Empire State Building and nearly three times the height of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. At The Top is a popular tourist destination in Dubai, which attracted 15.92 million overnight visitors in 2018.

The sales process began in November, both of these sources said, declining to be named as the deal is not public. Dubai is a regional hub for tourism, foreign trade and business services, but has faced a slowing real estate market for most of the decade.

"Protesters rally near Hong Kong harbour, more demos planned over Christmas",Dec 23 2019,"HONG KONG () - More than 1,000 protesters, many in surgical masks and balaclavas, filled a harbourside plaza near Hong Kong's financial district late on Monday (Dec 23) to demand full democracy and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality. As Hong Kong gears up for Christmas celebrations, the protesters plan wildcat gatherings in prime shopping malls and a 'silent night' rally on Tuesday evening. The demonstrators gathered at the harbourside on Monday sang ""Glory to Hong Kong"", a protest anthem, and shone lights from their mobile phones. Henry, a 28-year-old banker, said he was in the plaza to protest a recent  , a fund-raising platform for protesters. He wore a Guy Fawkes mask from the movie ""V for Vendetta"", which glowed green in the dark. ""The Hong Kong government is ruining our reputation as a financial centre. How can they say we are a place for finance if they can shut down the fund so unreasonably?"" he said. The protests, now in their seventh month, have . Police have arrested more than 6,000 people since the protests escalated in June, including more than 52 over the past weekend. Many Hong Kong residents are angry at what they see as Beijing's meddling in the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies interfering and says it is   put in place at that time and has blamed foreign forces for fomenting unrest. On Sunday, a peaceful protest ended in clashes when black-clad, masked demonstrators attacked police with kicks and punches and threw bricks and bottles. Police responded with bursts of pepper spray. One officer drew his pistol and pointed it towards a crowd but didn't fire,  witnesses said. Protesters plan to gather in five malls on Christmas Eve and will count down to Christmas near the harbour front in the bustling Tsim Sha Tsui district, social media posts say. More protests are planned for Christmas Day on Wednesday. The Civil Human Rights Front, which has organised some of the biggest marches involving more than a million people, has also applied to stage another march on New Year's Day. Some people taking part in Sunday's protest called for Hong Kong's independence from China and removed a Chinese flag from its pole, drawing condemnation from the government. Both the Beijing and Hong Kong governments have made clear such separatist rhetoric will not be tolerated. ""Advocating Hong Kong independence ... is not conducive to the overall and long-term interest of Hong Kong society. It is also contrary to the established basic policies of the People's Republic of China regarding Hong Kong,"" the city government said in a statement overnight. While police, including the leader of a major police union, have referred to the protesters as cockroaches, protesters routinely call the police dogs. On Monday, public broadcaster RTHK broadcast a video of a police public relations officer playing down the significance of the term cockroach.","{'neg': 0.087, 'neu': 0.871, 'pos': 0.043, 'compound': -0.9206}",-0.9206
"China to cut tariffs on goods including pork, tech items from Jan 1",Dec 23 2019,"BEIJING (, ) – China will lower tariffs on products ranging from frozen pork and avocado to some types of semiconductors next year as Beijing looks to boost imports amid a slowing economy and a trade war with the United States. Next year, China will implement temporary import tariffs, which are lower than the most-favoured-nation tariffs, on more than 850 products, the finance ministry said on Monday (Dec 23). That compared with 706 products that were taxed at temporary rates in 2019. The tariff changes were made to “increase imports of products facing a relative domestic shortage, or foreign specialty goods for everyday consumption,” the ministry said in a statement on its website. The move also helps to support Beijing's claim to be further opening its economy as it pursues a deal with the Trump administration. “The move in lowering import tariffs reflects that the government wants to reaffirm its stance to the world on freer trade amid the trade war,” said Gary Ng, an economist at Natixis in Hong Kong. “Domestically, lowering import tariffs are helpful in reducing business and consumer costs.” The list allows lower tariffs on goods coming from World Trade Organization members. For countries with which China has free-trade agreements, duties can be lower still. They include New Zealand, Peru, Costa Rica, Switzerland, Iceland, Singapore, Australia, South Korea, Georgia, Chile and Pakistan, according to the statement. The tariff reduction measures “facilitate the open economy to a new level,” according to the ministry statement. China and the United States cooled their drawn-out trade war earlier this month, announcing a Phase 1 agreement that would reduce some US tariffs in exchange for more Chinese purchases of American farm products and other goods. The finance ministry said the tariff rate for frozen pork will be cut to 8 per cent from the most-favoured-nation duty of 12 per cent, as China copes to plug a huge supply gap after a severe pig disease decimated its hog herd.  that started in August last year has nearly halved China's pig herd, official data showed, sending pork prices soaring to record levels. Beijing has issued a series of measures to boost pig production, while increasing imports of various meats to meet domestic demand. China brought in 229,707 tonnes of pork in November, up more than 150 per cent from the previous year. Pork imports CNC-PORK-IMP for the first 11 months of the year stood at 1.733 million tonnes, up 58 per cent from a year earlier. China will also lower temporary import tariffs for ferroniobium – used as an additive to high strength low alloy steel and stainless steel for oil and gas pipelines, cars and trucks – from 1% to zero in 2020 to support its high-tech development. The country brought in 35,909 tonnes of ferroniobium in 2018 and 37,818 tonnes for the first 10 months of this year. The tariff rate for frozen avocado was cut to 7 per cent from the most-favoured-nation duty of 30 per cent, the ministry said. China's economy is expanding at its weakest rate in nearly 30 years and could face more downward pressure next year, but the government has vowed to keep growth within a reasonable range in 2020 and keep policies forward-looking and effective. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said China had agreed to buy US$200 billion (S$271.3 billion) worth of additional US goods and services over the next two years as part of the Phase 1 trade pact to be signed in early January. If the purchases are made, they would represent a huge jump in US exports to China. Beijing has said the increased purchases are in line with the growing need of the Chinese people, as the country opens its markets further to global trade. Tariffs for some asthma and diabetes medications will be set at zero, the ministry said, while duties on some wood and paper products will be lowered too. Import tariffs on multi-component semiconductors will be cut to zero.","{'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.891, 'pos': 0.061, 'compound': 0.8768}",0.8768

"Nord Stream 2 to press on with Europe gas pipe, despite US sanctions",Dec 21 2019,"MOSCOW () - The group behind Nord Stream 2 said on Saturday (Dec 21) it aimed to complete a pipeline to boost Russian gas supplies to Europe as soon as possible, after US sanctions prompted a major contractor to suspend pipe-laying activities. US President Donald Trump signed a bill on Friday that  , which seeks to double gas capacity along the northern Nord Stream pipeline route to Germany. Washington, which has been seeking to sell more of its own liquefied natural gas (LNG) to European states, has said Nord Stream 2 will make Europe too reliant on Russian supplies. Gazprom, Russia's state-controlled gas giant and a major backer of Nord Stream 2, already supplies more than a third of Europe's gas needs. The company declined to comment. Nord Stream 2 will help Russia bypass Ukraine, the main route for Russian gas. Moscow and Kiev, which have been at loggerheads over Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, agreed a new transit deal this week after long-running talks. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will run along the Baltic Sea floor, was expected to start up in the first half of 2020. ""Completing the project is essential for European supply security. We together with the companies supporting the project will work on finishing the pipeline as soon as possible,"" Nord Stream 2 said on Saturday. It did not provide details. The statement followed Friday's announcement from Nord Stream 2 contractor, Swiss-Dutch company Allseas, which said it had suspended pipe-laying activities. The company said it would ""proceed, consistent with the legislation's wind down provision"" and said it expected guidance on the regulatory, technical and environmental issues from the US authority. Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday that Moscow ""will continue to implement its economic projects regardless of anyone's sanctions."" A senior Russian senator also said the Nord Stream 2 must stick to its schedule. Russia and Ukraine, embroiled in a political row and legal disputes,   shortly before the existing pact expires at the end of this year. Moscow had initially insisted on a short-term agreement to run until Nord Stream 2 came on stream. Ukraine, which earns hefty revenues from gas transit fees, wanted a long-term deal. Moscow and Kiev said on Saturday the new deal would last at least five years and could be extended for a further 10. They said it would include increased gas transport fees and set out gas volumes to be booked for transit through Ukraine. Nord Stream 2, which aims to double the Nord Stream route's existing capacity of 55 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas a year, is owned by Gazprom, which is financing half of the project worth about 9.5 billion euros (S$14.26 billion).","{'neg': 0.017, 'neu': 0.923, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': 0.936}",0.936
Facebook removes manipulative accounts with AI-generated pics,Dec 22 2019,"SAN FRANCISCO • Facebook has taken down a well-financed campaign that used dozens of artificially generated faces to spread pro-Trump and anti-Chinese government messages, the company and outside researchers have said. Researchers from the New York-based Graphika and the Digital Forensics Research Lab, an arm of the Washington-based Atlantic Council, said on Friday that it was the first time they had seen the large-scale use of computer-generated faces to spread disinformation on social media. The researchers said in a report that while tell-tale signs such as misshapen ears and distorted backgrounds had helped them identify the fakes, ""this technology is rapidly evolving towards generating more believable pictures"". Facebook said 610 Facebook accounts, 89 pages, 156 groups and 72 Instagram accounts were involved in the network. The social media giant said those behind the operation had spent upwards of US$9 million (S$12.2 million) on advertising to promote their content, which touched on hot-button issues such as ""impeachment, conservative ideology, political candidates, elections, trade, family values and freedom of religion"". The amount is almost 100 times what Facebook said Russia's infamous troll farm spent in the run-up to and shortly after the 2016 US presidential election. Facebook said its investigation linked the activity to US-based Epoch Media Group and individuals in Vietnam working on its behalf, though the accounts more openly associated with The BL, for the Beauty of Life. In a statement, Epoch said it had ""no connection with the website BL"". ""The BL was founded by a former employee, and employs some of our former employees,"" publisher Stephen Gregory said in a post to the Epoch Times website. He called on Facebook to withdraw its allegation and lift a pre-existing ban on Epoch Media's advertising. Facebook fired back, saying that BL executives ""were active admins on Epoch Media Group Pages as recently as this morning when their accounts were deactivated and the BL was removed"". The Epoch Times was set up as a print publication by followers of the falungong spiritual movement, banned in China, before moving heavily online. Its output has tended to steer towards support for US President Donald Trump and attacks on his opponents. Separately, Twitter said it has identified and removed nearly 6,000 accounts that it said were part of a coordinated effort by Saudi government agencies and individuals to advance the country's geopolitical interests. In a blog post on Friday, Twitter said the removed Saudi accounts amplified messages favourable to the Saudi authorities, through ""aggressive liking, retweeting and replying"". While the majority of the content was in Arabic, Twitter said the tweets also amplified discussions about sanctions in Iran and appearances by Saudi government officials in Western media. The Twitter and Facebook announcements underscore the fact that misinformation concerns are not limited to the US and Russia. ""Governments have started to launch influence campaigns the same ways commercial enterprises launch campaigns to sell detergent or cars,"" said Mr James Ludes, a national defence expert who teaches international relations and public policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. He said the 2016 Russian efforts showed it was possible to ""change public attitudes through the targeted use of social media"". While the attempts to root out the campaigns may seem like a game of whack-a-mole, he said, companies have at least shown progress in taking steps to identify and root out manipulation campaigns run by foreign powers.","{'neg': 0.045, 'neu': 0.875, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': 0.9682}",0.9682
"Look Back 2019: Five key debates, quotes and quips from Parliament",Dec 22 2019,"After aTee Zhuo , the House passed legislation that gives the Government comprehensive powers to tackle fake news, with 72 MPs saying “yes”, nine Workers' Party MPs saying “no” and three Nominated MPs abstaining. Although the   was first introduced as a Bill in April, the oft-fractious public discussion surrounding it stretches back to last year, when the Select Committee tasked to study fake news conducted its work. There were concerns that free speech and academic discourse would be stifled. Questions were also raised on the increase in powers granted to the Government, the definition of public interest, the distinction between fact and opinion, and difficulty in challenging ministers' decisions. Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam addressed these worries both in Parliament and public outreach efforts. Pofma has since been used four times by the Government – against People's Voice Party chief Lim Tean, the Singapore Democratic Party, Progress Singapore Party member Brad Bowyer, and website States Times Review. , which included more severe punishments and immediate restraining orders to curb offensive statements, were passed in October, but not before a five-hour debate involving 25 MPs. Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said updates were necessary, given rising religiosity, hate-fuelled violence, the abuse of social media, and increasing foreign interference - points he had raised six months earlier in a motion on restricting hate speech to maintain harmony. Workers' Party (WP) MPs raised concerns about keeping religion and politics separate. Ms Sylvia Lim questioned how religious leaders threw their support behind the proposed changes, and Mr Pritam Singh noted a religious leader was seen with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the last general election. Mr Shanmugam replied that friendships between religious and political leaders were vital, even as the Government remains a neutral referee between religions. Religious leaders have political and civil rights as well, he added, and such issues should be viewed ""without a party lens"". He and WP's Mr Faisal Manap faced off over the issue, with the latter saying that while he agreed religion should not be used to gain political advantage, he did not fully agree with the principle of separating religion from politics, as an ""intertwine between politics and religion"" is inevitable in forming policies. But after being pressed by Mr Shanmugam, Mr Faisal said: ""I do agree that religion needs to be kept apart from politics, so (it) won't be used to gain personal benefit or the benefit of... any political party.""

He introduced a motion following the October High Court judgment that found  . Mr Heng said the opposition has to hold itself to the same standards that it rightly applies to the Government, and called on the MPs involved to recuse themselves from all financial matters at AHTC. Ms Lim replied that they would file an appeal, calling Mr Heng's motion ""premature"". ""The PAP (People's Action Party) Government is clearly excited about certain findings and comments"" in the judgment, she said. Mr Heng asked for an adjournment ""to consider the matter"" and respond to Ms Lim. Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin granted him 10 minutes. AHTC has since said that Ms Lim and Mr Low need not recuse themselves. The National Development Ministry is reviewing the decision. After  by playwright Alfian Sa'at, MPs asked about the reasons for the cancellation and its implications for academic freedom. In his reply during the Oct 7 Parliament sitting, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said that academic freedom should not be misused to turn educational institutions into platforms for ""partisan politics"". The course would have included a workshop on designing protest signs and a discussion with journalist Kirsten Han, veteran journalist P.N. Balji and historian Thum Ping Tjin, as well as a documentary on Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong. Mr Ong also said schools should not work with those convicted of public order-related offences, working with foreign-funded advocacy groups, or who ""openly show disloyalty to Singapore"". Nominated MP Walter Theseira highlighted the virtues of liberal education in creating citizens who can think critically. He raised concerns over whether academics would teach contentious topics like dissent, and be biased towards ""the safe and the status quo"". NMP Anthea Ong said the Government should rethink its attitude towards youth advocacy and called for more youth involvement in policymaking.

Apart from statistics on related accidents, fires, and riders who have run afoul of the law, the biggest development is the  . Senior Minister of State for Transport Lam Pin Min said in Parliament last month that the number of PMD accidents and even deaths had risen despite government measures to promote safe use. In February, the speed limit for PMDs and bicycles on footpaths was reduced from 15kmh to 10kmh. Dr Lam said in Parliament the same month that banning PMDs from footpaths and restricting their use to roads would pose a greater risk to riders as well as motorists.

"Abenomics sputters as trade damage spreads, tax revenues undershoot",Dec 23 2019,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s “Abenomics” stimulus program appears to be reaching a turning point as growth is sputtering and the hit to exports from slowing global demand is spreading to various sectors of the economy. The slowdown makes it more likely that the government and central bank will need to devise novel ways to stimulate growth in the world’s third-largest economy in 2020, although they are hampered by a near-empty policy arsenal. Analysts don’t expect a fourth-quarter contraction to be a major catastrophe as long as a fragile Sino-U.S. trade truce lasts. But the signs that the economy is cooling after a year of expansion threaten Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s goal of achieving both economic revival and fiscal consolidation through a policy mix of monetary easing, flexible spending and structural reform. Policymakers have argued that the domestic economy remains shielded from the heavy blow to exports and factory activity from declining external demand. But analysts question whether the divergence between the manufacturing sector and the broader economy can last, as sliding sales of cars and at department stores suggest policymakers may have overestimated the strength of consumer demand. “There is always a link between the manufacturing economy and the domestic economy. Ultimately, the weakness of one will spill over into the other,” said Steve Cochrane, chief APAC economist at Moody’s Analytics. To be sure, Abe’s reflationary policy has helped boost gross domestic product to 540 trillion yen ($4.9 trillion), up 8.6% from 2012 levels, thanks to a windfall yen weakness boosting exporters’ profits and share prices.  But a string of data shows that domestic demand is weakening and labor market conditions are loosening. Department store sales fell much more than expected in October after a nationwide tax hike kicked in that month. The fall was 1.5 times as large as in the month of the previous tax hike, in April 2014. (For an interactive graphic of department store sales, click: ) New car sales were still reeling from a post-sales tax hike pullback in demand in November, sliding 13% compared with the same month in the previous year. They had already nearly recovered in the same time period after the 2014 tax hike. (For an interactive graphic of new car sales, click: ) Declines in car production due to weaker demand both abroad and at home and a powerful typhoon pushed down factory output too, which shrank at its fastest pace in nearly two years in October. A stagnation in output is already leading to an easing of conditions in the job market for manufacturers, the Bank of Japan’s December “tankan” survey showed. If the labor market eases further, wage growth will weaken and that will threaten a key driver behind consumer spending, a government official said. “It will be a red light (for the economy) if first-quarter growth is bad,” the official added. The weakening of the economy is taking its toll on the state’s already dire finances, causing tax revenue to undershoot official estimates after seven years of growth. Despite the sales tax hike and the near 30% rise in tax revenue from 2012 levels to above 60 trillion yen, officials say Abe is set to miss his latest revenue target. That would mark a setback for his strategy of counting on higher tax income as well as the BOJ’s low-rate policy to rein in a growing debt that’s over twice the size of Japan’s $5 trillion economy. (For an interactive graphic on Japan's state finances, click: ) But losing the ability to both raise spending and curb debt and warnings of credit downgrades will further cloud the outlook for Abe’s stimulus. “Indications that the government is unable to take measures that would mitigate the long-term economic and fiscal costs related to an ageing society would likely prompt a downgrade,” credit ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service warned in a report last month. Further straining finances, Japan has slashed its tax income estimate for the current fiscal year by more than 2 trillion yen from its initial target as the export slump caused by the 17-month-long Sino-U.S. trade war hit receipts. To compensate for the shortfall, the government will issue additional deficit covering bonds worth 2.2 trillion yen in an extra budget for this fiscal year. A government official shrugged off weakening tax revenue as a one-off, saying that tax income should return to steady growth in the near future. Japanese policymakers remain complacent about the country’s fiscal situation, reflecting a global trend toward shifting away from monetary to fiscal stimulus, with limited room left for monetary stimulus to battle any future financial crisis. “We have to strive to achieve both economic growth and fiscal reform at the same time,” former economy minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, a member of Abe’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told Reuters. “That is the only way we can achieve fiscal reform.” ","{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.081, 'compound': -0.836}",-0.836
Apache and Total team up for oil exploration off Suriname,Dec 23 2019,"(Reuters) - Apache Corp and French rival Total have formed a joint venture to develop a project off Suriname, the companies said, in a deal that gives the U.S. oil and gas producer a cash injection.  Apache’s Suriname offshore prospect, near the border with South America’s newest oil giant, Guyana, is a long-shot for the U.S. company, with the Total agreement providing financing to continue exploration.  Apache reported this month it had reached its target depth at its first Suriname well but said only that it would drill deeper, knocking 17% off its shares in two days as investors took the news as a sign the well had no commercially viable oil. Apache shares rose 17% to $26.53 on Monday on news of the agreement. With the gain, the shares are about flat year-to-date, compared with a 28% increase in the S&P 500 index of major U.S. stocks.  Exploration off Suriname is being watched closely as it is just over the border from Exxon Mobil and Hess Corp’s giant fields off the coast of Guyana estimated to hold more than 6 billion barrels of oil. Total has non-operating interests in two Guyana projects.  Total said it would give Apache a bonus of $100 million when the deal closes, reimburse half of Apache’s costs to date for its first three exploration wells, and could pay more depending on further developments. Apache said it would receive $5 billion of cash carry on its first $7.5 billion of appraisal and development capital along with other considerations. Total eventually would become the operator of the wells. The deal reduces Apache’s risk if the wells prove uneconomic, according to researchers at Cowen & Co, but “significantly reduces upside value potential.”   The U.S. oil producer has largely pulled back internationally to focus on its much-hyped Alpine High field in a remote corner of the Permian Shale basin, the top U.S. shale formation. However, Alpine High has been a disappointment, requiring enormous investment in pipeline infrastructure and delivering mostly natural gas at a time when prices are their lowest in more than two decades. Apache posted a $577 million loss in the first nine months of this year as it pulled back at Alpine High. Under the Suriname deal, Apache and Total will each hold a 50% working interest in Block 58. Apache will operate the first three exploration wells in the block, including the Maka Central-1 well, and subsequently transfer operations to Total.

Bank of Italy chief defends regulator's role in Bari bank crisis,Dec 23 2019,"MILAN (Reuters) - The head of Italy’s central bank rebuffed criticism of its role in supervising struggling lender Banca Popolare di Bari and said in an interview published on Monday that it was ready to account for its actions. Prosecutors in the southern Italian city of Bari are investigating the former cooperative bank’s chairman for alleged corruption in relation to the central bank’s supervisory activity, a judicial source said on Sunday. The Bank of Italy put Popolare di Bari, the biggest lender in the poorer south of the country, under special administration this month and Rome has agreed measures worth up to 900 million euros ($997 million) to prop up the unlisted bank.  “Banking supervision has accomplished its duties with the highest effort and, in my opinion, positively,” Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco told Il Corriere della Sera newspaper in an interview published on Monday. “We are ready to account for our actions, as we have always done, at an institutional level,” he said. The country’s banking crisis has shone a spotlight on the Bank of Italy’s supervisory role and the ruling 5-Star Movement has called for a reform of the how the central bank’s top managers are appointed. Visco said the central bank would, however, assess whether it had made mistakes - when asked about Popolare di Bari’s takeover of struggling rival Tercas in 2014. Critics say the deal accelerated Popolare de Bari’s problems by increasing its portfolio of bad loans. Popolare di Bari’s rescue is the latest episode in a string of banking crises to hit Italy since 2015, costing the state and other Italian banks some 23 billion euros. Visco said some small banks in Italy were still “weak” and the Bank of Italy was closely monitoring them. “The problem is that we have an insufficient crisis management system. To manage a crisis you don’t just need to be able to forecast it, you need tools,” he said, without specifying what tools he was referring to. “I’ve been asking for a long time for new rules to be established at the European level” he said.  The Bank of Italy was not immediately available for comment. Visco said the rescue plan for Popolare di Bari - which involves a depositor guarantee fund financed by Italian banks and state-owned Banca del Mezzogiorno-Mediocredito Centrale - aims to prevent depositors and bond holders losing money. But he suggested the cooperative bank’s 69,000 shareholders, who are mostly retail investors, could book losses. “The industrial plan will define the amount needed for new capital, the way to carry it out and the involvement of current shareholders,” Visco said. He said the plan would be open to other banks willing to join a larger financial entity with an adequate size for the “new technological and competitive environment”.

Bosnian lawmakers approve new government after 14-month deadlock,Dec 23 2019,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Bosnian lawmakers approved a new central government on Monday after a 14-month deadlock, opening the way for a resumption of reforms needed to become a candidate for EU membership and for talks on a new deal with the International Monetary Fund. Disagreement among the Bosnian presidency’s Serb, Croat and Bosniak members on how to proceed toward NATO integration had blocked the formation of a new government since a national election in the ethnically divided Balkan nation last year.     But after a compromise between the ethnic groups last month, parliament approved Bosnian Serb economist Zoran Tegeltija as prime minister on Dec. 5. Tegeltija had previously served as finance minister in Bosnia’s autonomous Serb Republic  On Monday parliament approved Tegeltija’s proposed new cabinet team by 29 votes in the 42-seat parliament. The prime minister made no statement after the vote. Tegeltija, from the Bosnian Serb ruling SNSD party, was nominated by SNSD chief Milorad Dodik, who also serves as a Serb member on Bosnia’s tripartite presidency, in exchange for a reform program demanded by NATO, previously blocked by the Serbs who oppose closer ties with the alliance. His cabinet will include nine ministers from the three biggest ethnic parties - the SNSD, the Croats’ HDZ and the Bosniaks’ SDA - and two ministers from the SDA’s junior partners, the SBB and the DF. A minister for human rights and refugees has yet to be approved because of procedural delays, Tegeltija said. After the 1992-95 war that destroyed the old Yugoslavia, Bosnia was split into two autonomous regions linked by a weak central government: the Serb Republic and the Federation, dominated by Bosniak Muslims and Croats. The latter has yet to form a new government. Tegeltija has said his key priority will be to unblock reforms needed for Bosnia to secure the status of a candidate for eventual European Union membership, and also to release frozen investments to spur much-needed economic growth. Bosnia lags its Balkan neighbors in the race to join the EU, due partly to its unwieldy political structures and lack of a strong central administration. Bosnia signed a 553 million euro ($612.7 million) loan deal with the IMF in 2016 but it was frozen in 2018 over stalled economic reforms.

Canadian retail sales decline revives Bank of Canada rate cut bets,Dec 21 2019,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian retail sales plummeted unexpectedly in October, the latest in a series of disappointing economic data releases that analysts say could force the Bank of Canada to consider a rate cut. Statistics Canada said on Friday that retail trade dropped by 1.2% on lower sales of motor vehicles and parts. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a gain of 0.5%. The Bank of Canada, which has kept its overnight interest rate unchanged for more than a year even as several of its international counterparts eased, projected a 1.3% increase in domestic fourth quarter growth in October. Yet the growth data so far has been underwhelming, analysts said on Friday. “The weakness of GDP growth in the fourth quarter will clearly concern policymakers and means that we can’t completely rule out an insurance interest rate cut in the new year,” said Stephen Brown, a senior Canada economist with Capital Economics. Chances of a cut over the coming year, which had dwindled in recent weeks, jumped to nearly 50% from about 25% before the data, the overnight index swaps market indicated. BOCWATCH Lower sales were reported in 8 of 11 subsectors, representing 81% of retail trade. The Canadian dollar weakened as much as 0.4% to 1.3181 to the U.S dollar, giving up its gains for the week. “Apparently, Canadians were in no mood to spend in October,” said CIBC Capital Markets Senior Economist Royce Mendes in a note to clients. Recent releases, he said, “are likely enough for central bankers to at least begin discussing again whether easier financial conditions will be warranted in 2020”. Statistics Canada data earlier this week showed wholesale trade fell 1.1% in October on weaker sales of machinery equipment and supplies, while factory sales fell 0.7%. When Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced on Monday that budget deficits would be larger than forecast for the next five years, he said the economy was doing well. Canada shed an unexpected 71,200 jobs in November, the biggest decline since 2009, while the national unemployment rate rose to 5.9%, the highest in more than a year. “The numbers will keep concerns alive that the domestic Canadian economic growth backdrop has lost its footing somewhat at the end of the year,” said RBC Senior Economist Nathan Janzen in a note, especially given the softer employment data. In a separate release, Statistics Canada said new home prices unexpectedly fell 0.1% in November. ","{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.837, 'pos': 0.095, 'compound': 0.8957}",0.8957

"China to lower import tariffs on frozen pork, avocados from January 1",Dec 23 2019,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will lower tariffs on products ranging from frozen pork and avocado to some types of semiconductors next year as Beijing looks to boost imports amid a slowing economy and a trade war with the United States. Next year, China will implement temporary import tariffs, which are lower than the most-favored-nation tariffs, on more than 850 products, the finance ministry said on Monday. By comparison, 706 products were taxed at temporary rates in 2019.  The tariff changes were made to “increase imports of products facing a relative domestic shortage, or foreign speciality goods for everyday consumption,” the ministry said in a statement on its website. China and the United States cooled their drawn-out trade war earlier this month, announcing a Phase 1 agreement that would reduce some U.S. tariffs in exchange for more Chinese purchases of American farm products and other goods. The finance ministry said the tariff rate for frozen pork will be cut to 8% from the most-favoured-nation duty of 12%, as China tries to plug a huge supply gap after disease decimated its hog herd. However, meat industry insiders in both China and the United States said the measure did not appear to affect the retaliatory tariffs in place for U.S. pork. Beijing has waived extra tariffs on some U.S. soybean and pork cargoes in recent weeks, in a goodwill gesture to Washington, as the two countries move closer to signing a trade deal.  The tariffs on U.S. pork, currently up to 72%, will go down to 68% when the tax rate cut takes effect in the new year. “U.S. pork will remain at a significant disadvantage compared to competing products until China’s retaliatory duties are addressed,” the U.S. Meat Export Federation said in a statement. But the measure will help boost China’s overall pork imports and ease the domestic shortage, analysts said.  “This is part of the Chinese government’s serious effort to increase pork supplies. It will definitely help,” said Jim Huang, chief executive at China-America Commodity Data Analytics.  The tax rate cut applies to frozen hams, shoulders and cuts of swine, with bone in, and other frozen meat of swine. It does not affect other pig products, including offal, carcasses and chilled pork, according to the government notice.  An outbreak of African swine fever that began in August last year has nearly halved China’s pig herd, official data showed, sending pork prices soaring to record levels.  Beijing has issued a series of measures to boost pig production, while increasing imports of various meats to meet domestic demand.  China brought in 229,707 tonnes of pork in November, up more than 150% from the previous year. Pork imports for the first 11 months of the year stood at 1.733 million tonnes, up 58% from a year earlier. Almost all of the pork shipments coming to China are frozen pork. The European Union, Canada and the United States are among the top exporters.   China will also lower temporary import tariffs for ferroniobium - used as an additive to high-strength low-alloy steel and stainless steel for oil and gas pipelines, cars and trucks - from 1% to zero in 2020 to support its high-tech development.  The country brought in 35,909 tonnes of ferroniobium in 2018 and 37,818 tonnes for the first 10 months of this year.  The tariff rate for frozen avocado was cut to 7% from the most-favoured-nation duty of 30%, the ministry said.  China’s economy is expanding at its weakest rate in nearly 30 years and could face more downward pressure next year, but the government has vowed to keep growth within a reasonable range in 2020 and keep policies forward-looking and effective. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said China had agreed to buy $200 billion worth of additional U.S. goods and services over the next two years as part of the Phase 1 trade pact to be signed in early January. If the purchases are made, they would represent a huge jump in U.S. exports to China. Beijing has said the increased purchases are in line with the growing needs of the Chinese people, as the country opens its markets further to global trade. Tariffs for some asthma and diabetes medications will be set at zero, the ministry said, while duties on some wood and paper products will be lowered, too. Import tariffs on multi-component semiconductors will be cut to zero. China will also further lower most-favoured-nation import tariffs on some information technology products from July 1, the ministry said.

Colombia central bank statement on interest rate decision,Dec 21 2019,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia’s central bank unanimously held its benchmark interest rate at 4.25% yet again at its meeting on Friday, a rate the bank chief said could remain in place for a “relatively long period” as inflation and growth risks diminish. The following is a Reuters translation of the statement accompanying the bank’s decision:  “In this decision, the board mainly considered the following information: In November, annual inflation (3.84%) decreased slightly. Supply shocks that have affected inflation are expected to begin to subside and in early 2020 inflation will resume its convergence to the target, as reflected in market expectations. Basic inflation measures are close to 3%. With new information regarding economic activity, the bank’s technical team maintained the projection of economic growth for 2019 at 3.2%. The outlook for global growth remains moderate and in the United States the Federal Reserve kept its interest rate constant. The projection of the current account deficit for 2019 continues to exceed 4% of gross domestic product and continues to be financed mainly by foreign direct investment. Based on this information, the board considered the following factors in its decision: Transitory deviations of inflation with respect to the target, uncertainty about the persistence of the depreciation of the peso and its degree of transfer to domestic prices. The size of excess productive capacity and the speed with which they are reduced. The effects on the Colombian economy derived from changing external conditions. In this environment, when evaluating the state of the economy and the balance of risks, the board unanimously decided to maintain the reference interest rate at 4.25%. The board will continue to carefully monitor the behavior of inflation and projections of economic activity, as well as the evolution of the current account and the international situation.  Finally, the board reiterates that monetary policy will depend on the new information available.” ","{'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.871, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': 0.8744}",0.8744
Credit Suisse admits spying on second executive,Dec 23 2019,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse () on Monday admitted to snooping on another of the bank’s former executives, deepening a spying scandal at the Swiss group, which is already under investigation for putting its ex-wealth management chief under surveillance. Switzerland’s second-largest bank blamed former chief operating officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee for hiring detectives in February to track former HR head Peter Goerke. They described a rogue operation in which all executives and directors, including Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam, were kept in the dark about what was going on. Credit Suisse had earlier blamed Bouee for a similar incident involving former wealth management boss Iqbal Khan and had also cleared Thiam of any role in it. At the time, Thiam characterized it as an “isolated incident”. Reuters was not immediately able to reach Bouee and Goerke for comment. “The observation of Peter Goerke, which has now been confirmed, is inexcusable,” Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner said in a statement, adding there was “grave concern” that those responsible for ordering the surveillance had not mentioned it during an earlier probe regarding Khan. “We are aware that the observation of Iqbal Khan and Peter Goerke have damaged the reputation of our bank,” Rohner said. Goerke had no knowledge that he had been followed by private detectives until officials from the bank contacted him shortly before Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung made the matter public last Monday, a person familiar with his thinking said.  Goerke, who remains employed by the bank as an adviser, saw no grounds to pursue the matter criminally, the person said, and was in contact with senior officials at Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse has been in the spotlight since September when Khan filed a criminal complaint in Zurich after a confrontation  between him and one of the private detectives tailing him.  The bank launched an investigation and found it had bankrolled the surveillance. An investigation by law firm Homburger into the spying on Khan — who now works for rival UBS () — had found Bouee and a security boss under him were alone responsible for the order and found no evidence of other incidents. Both resigned and Credit Suisse said on Monday that Bouee’s employment had now been terminated for cause, indicating his bonus and other potential compensation would likely be forfeited. Bouee was a long-time associate of Thiam and had followed him to Credit Suisse from Prudential ().  Harris Associates, the bank’s third-largest investor, according to Refinitiv data, remained positive.  “We are extremely supportive of the CS executive management team - a team that we believe has greatly improved CS over the last four years,” David Herro, manager of the firm’s Oakmark International Fund, told Reuters. Switzerland’s finance watchdog is looking into the bank’s surveillance activities and its corporate governance. There is also a criminal probe into the Khan affair. A Credit Suisse spokesman said Credit Suisse and Homburger would continue their latest probe having determined that Bouee and others involved had not told the truth when asked about any other surveillance orders in September and had taken care not to leave any identifiable traces in the bank’s systems. “Credit Suisse will look into any relevant indications if we receive information about alleged (surveillance),” he said. Credit Suisse stock was down 0.4% at 1530 GMT while the European bank sector index .SX7P was off 0.7%. ","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.834, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.9669}",0.9669
Disruptive decade: Ten things the teen years brought world markets,Dec 23 2019,"LONDON (Reuters) - The 21st century’s teen years, bookended by a financial crisis at the start and the fintech revolution at the end, were a decade of disruption. From negative borrowing costs to bitcoin, here are ten trends that have upended traditional economic and investment models in the past decade: 1/FAANG-TASTIC FIVE If they were a country, they would be the fifth largest in terms of economic output, outgunning Britain and snapping at Germany’s heels. With a $3.9 trillion market value (versus around $100 billion in January 2010), tech giants Facebook, Amazon.com, Apple, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet — collectively known as the FAANGs — are not only at the vanguard of history’s longest share bullrun but have transformed how humans work, shop, consume news and relax. FAANGs comprise 7% of the MSCI global equity index today, up from around 1.6% in early 2010. The savvy investor who sank $25,000 in Netflix in 2009 would now be sitting on $1 million. And in the slip stream of the five pioneers, other tech titans are rising, from China’s BAT grouping of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent to sector “disupters” Uber, Airbnb and Deliveroo. For better or worse, the world — and markets — have changed for ever.      (GRAPHIC: Rise of the FAANGs - )     A defining feature of the years following the 2008-2009 meltdown was the slide of interest rates and government borrowing costs below 0%, possibly for the first time in history. U.S. and German 10-year borrowing costs collapsed by 200 to 400 basis points this decade; the latter to as low as minus 0.7%. Roughly $12 trillion in debt carries negative yields, almost a quarter of all bonds outstanding. The drivers — central banks’ asset buying, sub-zero interest rates, yield curve manipulation and the tech revolution’s deflationary effects — were in themselves groundbreaking, at least in terms of scale. The Bank of Japan holds assets collectively worth more than Japan’s economy. The European Central Bank’s balance sheet is a quarter the euro zone’s annual output but double decade-ago levels. Interactive graphic on central bank balance sheet  (GRAPHIC: Borrowing costs collapsed in the 2010s - )         With record-low rates and yield-starved investors, bonds with tenors longer than the average human lifespan have caught on.  A handful of 100-year bonds were around in 2010, but Mexico’s $1 billion issue maturing 2110 started an issuance surge that saw U.S. and British universities, Ireland, Belgium and Austria, U.S. municipalities and corporations such as Coca Cola and Petrobras sell century bonds. Even junk-rated serial defaulter Argentina drew huge bids for its 2117-maturity bond.   Just over 1,400 century bonds, worth almost $170 billion are now outstanding, according to Refinitiv.  But ... caveat emptor. Buyers of the Argentine century bond have watched it lose half its value. Austria's issue, also sold in 2017, is up more than 60%. Interactive graphic (graphics//item:portal/graphic/0H001QXPG9W8)?q=wild&pa=true&pi=true&rdts=1577100590091  (GRAPHIC: Tale of two centuries - )     In 2010, Bitcoin was an idea causing ripples in niche online forums. Ten years later, cryptocurrencies are intertwined with finance, business and politics. Crypto markets, non-existent in 2010, are now worth over $200 billion, having hit a $815 billion peak at the apex of the bitcoin bubble. Having changed hands for just 3 cents in its first public trade, bitcoin now trades over $7,500. That’s off its peak near $20,000, though - a reminder of its volatility. Usage has also spread. Coin Metrics estimates that from 130 active bitcoin addresses a decade back, there are now nearly 750,000. Crypto took many guises through the 2010s, from rebel technology to a tool for criminals, speculative token to the great hope for frictionless payments. While it never really shook off doubts over security, virtual money and blockchain tech have evolved at a dizzying pace, typified recently by Facebook’s push to launch its Libra token and steps by central banks to create their own digital currencies.

Hence spectacular ETF growth — assets have swelled to almost $7 trillion, from below $2 trillion in 2010, consultancy ETFGI says. Low investment fees should help extend the boom: total ETF assets could hit $50 trillion in 2030, BofA predicts.     (GRAPHIC: ETF asset upsurge -  )    With the hottest four years on record occurring in the past four years (according to the  World Meteorological Organization), climate is shaping investor thinking in a way it did not a decade ago.  Crop failures, floods and wildfires can all inflict portfolio losses. More funds are reducing exposure to polluting industries, embracing renewables and water conservation technologies or investing in the likes of fake-meat firm Beyond Meat, whose 2019 IPO was greeted with rapture on Wall Street.  Over $30 trillion is held in sustainable or green investments, the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance estimates, more than doubling from 2011.  Green bonds debuted in 2007 to fund projects with environment benefits. This year, issuance totaled a record $200 billion-plus. (GRAPHIC: Green bond issuance ends decade with record year - ) Having learned to wring oil from shale with fracking, the United States has vaulted to the top of the  oil producer rankings, with 12.5 million barrels per day of output, double 2010 levels. Shale oil production exceeds 9 million bpd, from below one million bpd in 2010, making the United States an oil exporter for the first time in 40 years. The shale boom is partly why conversations around energy have switched from peak supply to peak demand. Surging output comes alongside environmental concerns, meaning an oil glut is likelier than shortages. Interactive chart  (GRAPHIC: U.S. crude oil production, 2000-2019 - )     Having relied for over a century on the internal combustion engine, the global auto industry is being upended by battery-powered cars. In 2010, electric car maker Tesla went public and its shares, launched at $17, now trade at $380.  Hundreds of billions of dollars have been pledged to develop a new generation of electric cars. Industries supplying car batteries are booming and demand for their main component, lithium, could triple by 2025. EV sales so far have disappointed — two out of 100 cars sold today are electric. Petrol and diesel vehicles are cheaper and EV charging infrastructure is limited.  But growing alarm over climate change and government incentives to steer consumers away from petrol means the electric revolution looks unstoppable.     (GRAPHIC: Tesla's first decade - )     Tech’s transformative power has not bypassed currency trading floors. Ten years ago, dealers did the buying and selling for banks and clients. Today, electronic trading comprises 90% of some products, doubling in this period. Another shift is toward “algos” — computer programs that follow pre-set instructions, or algorithms, to trade, often at speeds impossible for humans. From being largely nonexistent a decade ago, algo trading now comprises a fifth of FX spot volumes on Refinitiv FXall, a platform for the buyside. On another venue EBS, over 80% of the order book is algo-driven, the Bank for International Settlements estimates. One side effect is that ‘flash crashes’ — wild exchange rate swings — have become frequent, ostensibly due to algos that are programmed to turn off if markets become volatile.     The winners? Those who can afford the most sophisticated algos. Almost half of global currency trading is now with the top five banks, with smaller institutions — and of course, traders — having to exit.     (GRAPHIC: Algorithmic vs manual on EBS - )     Marijuana took a trip this decade from street corners to stock markets. The first pure-play U.S. “potstock” — Tilray — debuted on NasDaq in 2018, leaping 36% on the first day. And 18 months since Canada legalized recreational cannabis, hundreds of potstocks are trading. Pot also spawned one of the decade’s asset bubbles. Dubbed the green rush, shares in firms such as Aurora Cannabis and Canopy Growth rose several-fold before peaking in October 2018. At their high, the 10 biggest components of a potstock benchmark, the Alternative Harvest ETF, were worth $50 billion. A year later, $30 billion had gone up in smoke. Blame regulation and overproduction hitting weed prices. A sign of a maturing industry? The highs may have evaporated, but potstocks aren't going anywhere. Except perhaps London, which may host the next set of cannabis listings in 2020.

"Equinor, Rosneft to develop Arctic oilfield in joint investment",Dec 23 2019,"OSLO/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s Rosneft and Norway’s Equinor have agreed details on how to develop an Arctic Siberian onshore oilfield, they said on Monday, their first joint investment since agreeing a strategic partnership in 2012. The firms expect to extract about 250 million barrels of oil and 23 billion cubic meters of gas in the first stage of developing the Severo-Komsomolskoye oilfield, Equinor said, without giving a value for the investment. Rosneft has a 66.67% stake and Equinor holds the remaining shares in SevKomNeftegaz, which owns the license. Rosneft and Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, initially agreed to develop an onshore North Komsomolskoye oilfield in 2013, before Western sanctions were imposed on Rosneft in 2014 because of Moscow’s role in the Ukraine crisis.  Sanctions ban western companies from assisting Rosneft in exploring deepwater and Arctic offshore fields or helping Rosneft extract shale oil. They also limit Rosneft’s ability to raise long-term financing in Western markets.  Rosneft said in 2015 that the North Komsomolskoye field has “complex geology associated with an oil rim of highly viscous oil”, describing the resources as “difficult-to-extract”.  Viscous oil is heavy oil, which does not easily flow through production equipment as well as light crude. Heavy oil also tends to be responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than light crude as it requires more energy to produce.  Equinor CEO Eldar Saetre said in 2017 that the company would no longer explore for heavy oil, but its spokesman told Reuters in November it might still develop the heavy oil assets it already had in its portfolio, such as North-Komsomolskoye.

Exclusive: Dubai's Emaar to sell view from world's tallest tower - sources,Dec 23 2019,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Emaar Properties EMAR.DU is selling the observation decks of the world’s tallest skyscraper the Burj Khalifa, four sources told Reuters, potentially raising $1 billion for Dubai’s biggest developer amid a real estate downturn.  Two of the sources said Emaar had appointed Standard Chartered () to advise it on the sale of the popular “At The Top” tourist attraction. Emaar, in which the Dubai government has a minority stake of 29.2%, and Standard Chartered declined to comment. At over 828 metres, the Burj Khalifa is twice as tall as New York’s Empire State Building and nearly three times the height of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. At The Top is a popular tourist destination in Dubai, which attracted 15.92 million overnight visitors in 2018. The viewing decks make about 600-700 million dirhams ($163-$191 million) a year, a banking source said.  A financial source estimated they could be worth around $1 billion.  The sales process began in November, both of these sources said, declining to be named as the deal is not public. Dubai is a regional hub for tourism, foreign trade and business services, but has faced a slowing real estate market for most of the decade. It set up a real estate planning commission in September to regulate projects and avoid competition between semi-government and private firms. Emaar has been divesting hospitality related assets to finance existing operations and expansion, an industry source and a Dubai-based banker said. Emaar hired Standard Chartered earlier this year for the sale of its district cooling business, and last year for the disposal of five hospitality assets, which were sold to Abu Dhabi National Hotels.

"UPDATE 2-FTSE 100 gains for ninth straight session, midcaps near record high",Dec 23 2019,"* FTSE 100 up 0.5%, FTSE 250 up 0.8% * Markets seeing “classic squeeze” - analyst * NMC enjoys best day ever * Nichols slumps after profit alert (Adds news items, analyst comments, updates to closing prices) By Shashwat Awasthi Dec 23 (Reuters) - Britain’s blue-chip equities index gained for a ninth straight session on Monday in holiday-thinned trading, while midcaps hovered near all-time highs. The FTSE 100 rose 0.5% to hit its highest in nearly five months and match its best run of gains since May 2017. The FTSE 250 jumped 0.8%, up for the third straight session. Both benchmark indexes drifted lower in early dealings as traders locked in profits ahead of Christmas, but a lack of negative news and paltry trading volumes helped them recover. “Given the low liquidity conditions, it does not take much to change the market,” Raymond James analyst Chris Bailey said. “Note too the lack of real losers. Classic squeeze up just ahead of Christmas.” The stand-out gainer was NMC Health, which surged almost 37% on its best day ever after it promised an independent review of its books. Its shares had nearly halved in value last week after short-selling firm Muddy Waters questioned its finances. “The fact the company is taking such action implies they don’t have anything to hide, which has encouraged some traders to swoop in and snap up the relatively cheap stock,” CMC Markets analyst David Madden said. Dealers seemed content to reflect on major developments of the month, including a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s election victory which have helped the FTSE 100 surge nearly 5% in the last two weeks. The exporter-heavy index is on course for its best month since June, while the more domestically-focussed midcaps are on track for a fourth straight month of gains. Both benchmark indexes look set for their ninth month of gains this year. Some of that momentum has eased after Johnson’s hard line on a trade agreement with the European Union revived fears of a chaotic Brexit and market players are likely to hold off on making further bets before the new year. Lingering Brexit concerns left sterling hamstrung on Monday, boosting firms with a larger international exposure such as Shell, Unilever and Diageo, which lent further support to the main index.

Global shares inch to new highs on trade hopes; dollar little changed,Dec 23 2019,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar traded little changed while equity markets added to a year-end rally on Monday, with both a gauge of stock performance worldwide and Wall Street hitting new highs amid renewed optimism over U.S.-China trade and growth prospects. China’s finance ministry said it will lower tariffs on products ranging from frozen pork and avocados to certain semiconductors next year as Beijing looks to boost imports amid a slowing economy and a trade war with the United States. China will implement temporary import tariffs, which are lower than the most-favored-nation tariffs, on more than 850 products, an increase from 706 products that were taxed at temporary rates in 2019, the ministry said. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.08%, reaching a new record of 563.81, while its emerging market index rose 0.29%. MSCI’s all-country world index has risen more than 3% in December as U.S.-China trade tensions eased and confidence grew that Britain would avoid a chaotic exit from the European Union. The index is up 23% in 2019, set for its best year in a decade. The market remains focused on the trade war, said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. “It’s a rally being based upon momentum buying now. Stocks are being marked up, and it will continue right up until year end,” he said, referring to the U.S. equity market. President Donald Trump on Saturday said the United States and China would “very shortly” sign their so-called Phase 1 trade pact.

In France, the CAC 40 index  gained 0.13% but the trade-sensitive Deutsche Boerse DAX  fell by the same amount. The index has gained steadily since September as the prospect of a Sino-U.S. trade deal improved. Overnight in Asia, Japan's Nikkei  closed little changed after hitting a 14-month top last week. Chinese stocks posted their worst single-day drop in six weeks, weighed down by a correction in tech shares after a state fund announced plans to cut its stakes in some chip makers. The dollar held near a two-week high against a basket of currencies, while sterling fell on concerns over the British government’s hard line on Brexit talks. The dollar, which benefits when the U.S. economy outperforms others, as well as during bouts of risk aversion due to its safe-haven status, has been supported since Washington and Beijing came to an interim trade agreement earlier this month.

"Leveraged loan market size doubles in ten years, private credit explodes",Dec 23 2019,"NEW YORK, Dec 23 (LPC) - What a difference 10 years make. It was December 2010, in the aftermath of the financial crisis when the US government was forced to approve a US$700bn rescue package slated to avert the collapse of the country’s financial system. The 2008 crisis was perhaps the first time many American households learned about leveraged loans for companies that take on significant amounts of debt. And households did so amid the chaos and worry of a long and deep recession for which many thought the obscure and little-known loan product was partially to blame. The loan market, which provides funding for US corporates, and pays investors an interest rate tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate for the privilege of borrowing, was just US$497.5bn in size in December 2010. Average loan bids bounced back from a low of 62.8 during the financial crisis but were still sitting at 96.61. Fast forward to December 2019 and the size of the leveraged loan market has more than doubled to US$1.2trn. Loans have rallied, pushing prices to an average 98.95 cents on the dollar, the highest level since October 2018. “The growth in the loan market has been a big phenomenon,” said Jonathan Insull, a managing director at Crescent Capital Group, which oversees more than US$26bn in assets. Ten years of low interest rates that injected the financial system with much needed liquidity after the crisis allowed US companies to binge on cheap loans. Loan trades became quicker, and the secondary market, where bankers and investors exchange pieces of loans like stocks or bonds, deepened. The size of the transactions got larger as loans evolved into a mature asset class. Leveraged loans returned 7% this year, per Refinitiv LPC data. High-yield bonds, meanwhile, returned less than 14%, according to the ICE BofAML US High Yield index. Lender protections eroded as private equity sponsors, attracted by the leverage on offer, tapped the loan market to fund buyouts –and cash out soon after. Idiosyncratic terms like covenant-lite became the norm in the institutional market, as well as sponsors massaging debt-to-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization levels (Ebitda), through add-backs, which lower leverage through expected synergies or future cost savings. And companies including Neiman Marcus and PetSmart created unrestricted subsidiaries in a bid to shield their most valuable assets from creditors. The market’s explosive growth and notoriety resulted in increased oversight as regulators, wary of another downturn, tried to crack down on excesses. “The benefits have been greater liquidity and a larger asset class,” Insull said.” In the last 10 years loans have become more mainstream. It has also attracted more attention.” The 2010 Dodd-Frank bill, which was signed by President Barack Obama, banned banks from speculating with their own money and forced Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) managers to retain 5% of their funds, or have ‘skin in the game.’ The Volcker Rule, better known for its ban on prop trading, prohibited banks from investing in CLOs that own bonds, which led the funds to purchase loans only or lose important investors. Leveraged lending guidance from the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, which was updated in 2013, curbed debt limits in buyouts and encouraged quick debt repayments. But even a tougher regulatory environment couldn’t slow the growth of leveraged loans. The leveraged loan explosion that took place this decade would not be possible without the appetite from CLOs, the largest buyer of leveraged loans. After being compared to Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs), which earned significant notoriety – a bad reputation – due to the defaulted mortgages they held, leading to the financial crisis, CLO issuance ground to a halt. As the narrative changed and the public became better educated on differences between the two markets, CLO issuance soared. The asset class has grown 144% since the start of 2013 through the end of November, according to LPC Collateral data. US CLO issuance continued at a strong pace in 2019 after a record 2018. There has been more than US$114bn US CLOs arranged this year, through December 18, according to the data. “The obvious change is really the growth of the marketplace both for CLOs and loans, since they are interconnected, and in particular, the growth of the CLO market given how well it performed through the crisis and the ensuing resurgent issuance that has driven the market,” said Steven Oh, global head of credit and fixed income at PineBridge Investments, which oversees more than US$96bn in assets. The result of the post-crisis regulatory crackdown was a pullback in lending by some of the largest banks, which pushed the more aggressive financings to institutions not subject to the guidance, and the private debt lending system was created. “The theme for 2019 was private debt,” Grant Moyer, head of leveraged capital markets, told journalists at an MUFG event on Tuesday. “The emergence or takeoff – it’s been a slow build after the financial crisis in 2008 … and really started ramping in 2014 and 2015, creating an opportunity for private debt markets to be more aggressive in facilitating for issuers.” Initially known as shadow banking, the private lending market is perhaps the most significant effect of the new regulations in the loan market in the last 10 years. Enabling this movement was a wave of institutional capital pouring into alternative investments in a global hunt for yield. “Negative interest rates created an environment where investors have had to reach further down the risk spectrum,” said Elaine Stokes, a portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles. “Around the world, this leaves investors challenged when looking for returns (on investment).” As a result, insurance companies and pension funds turned to riskier investment strategies to obtain higher returns and plug growing deficits. Private credit funds benefited and raised record amounts of capital allowing them the firepower to compete head-to-head with traditional banks for deals. “Shadow banking, or unregulated financiers, can be more creative and take more risk (than banks),” said Todd Koretzky, a partner at law firm Allen & Overy. “It’s a lower-risk proposition for a borrower as they lock in a relationship through a club.” Driven by interest from private equity funds and with a focus on the middle market, which was largely being ignored by financial institutions, private credit flourished. “The middle market space has been inundated with a number of new lenders and new direct lenders as well as regular asset managers that have been active for a number of years,” said Art de Pena, head of loan syndications and distribution at MUFG. “As they’ve grown their assets under management, they said, ‘Hey, how do I see more transactions?’ And instead of waiting for Credit Suisse or RBS to bring deals to them, they are saying, ‘Let’s go direct.’ So direct lending has become really in vogue.” This year saw a wave of US$1bn-plus unitranches underwritten by the larger players in the private credit space, a milestone first hit in 2016 when Ares led a US$1bn financing for a buyout of Qlik Technologies by private equity firm Thoma Bravo. Direct lenders “call the sponsors directly and they call corporates directly and they say we can take distribution risk off the table by giving you immediate capital and we can hold that capital for long term, so therefore it’s a lot more attractive than taking market distribution risk,” de Pena said. In the last five years, private credit has become a mainstream asset class. Banks run private credit funds through asset management arms. Private equity firms operate credit shops and other firms have the backing of large financial institutions and pension funds. Private credit funds come from a range of constituency. Some were born in the world of private equity by firms seeking to diversify their offering by managing private credit funds. These include KKR &Co, Carlyle Group, Bain Capital and Apollo Global Management. Some of the largest players in the market, such as Ares Management Corp, Golub Capital, and Owl Rock Capital Group, were conceived in credit. Antares Capital, a unit of GE Capital that dominated the non-bank lending market in the first half of the decade, was sold to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in 2015. Twin Brook Capital Partners and Churchill Capital, two of the most active managers in the core middle market, are owned by investment firms Nuveen and Angelo Gordon. Most private credit funds also manage public and private Business Development Companies to provide funding for loans and source funding from retail investors. While institutional capital deployed in funds has fueled a structural realignment in the leveraged finance market, many market participants are weary the private credit asset class has not been tested through a downturn, which could, in the best case, cause the market to consolidate. While private credit continues to dominate the discussion, the biggest investment banks have benefited from President Trump’s business-friendly policies, pushing them back to the top of the league tables and bringing the loan market full circle over the last decade.

Modi's party loses Indian state election amid protests over citizenship law,Dec 23 2019,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party lost control of another state on Monday, adding to a string of electoral losses since last December amid protests that mark the biggest challenge to the Hindu-nationalist leader. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) conceded defeat in the eastern state of Jharkhand, with an alliance of the main opposition Congress party and a regional bloc slated to take control of the resource-rich province. “I dedicate this victory to the people of Jharkhand,” Hemant Soren, leader of the regional Jharkhand Mukti Morcha party, said after claiming victory. The loss comes in the middle of a sometimes deadly wave of nationwide protests triggered by a new citizenship law, which critics say discriminates against Muslims and has brought thousands of people out on to the streets in opposition. The polls in Jharkhand opened on Nov. 30, before the demonstrations kicked off and do not represent the current public mood. However, the BJP’s defeat will be a shot in the arm for India’s opposition parties, some of which have used popular anger against the Citizenship Amendment Act to their advantage. The Modi government insists that the law is needed to help persecuted non-Muslim minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who came to India before 2015 by giving them Indian citizenship. And in a show of strength on Monday, the BJP staged a protest, attended by several hundred people, in Kolkata in support of the CAA. “Today, we have seen that Bengal stands with Modi ji and it welcomes the Citizenship Amendment Act,” said Jagat Prakash Nadda, the BJP’s national working president, using an honorific for the prime minister. But groups opposed to the law gathered in the southern cities of Bangalore and Chennai, the capital New Delhi and north eastern Assam state, in the latest demonstrations against the CAA and the Modi government’s proposal to conduct a nationwide National Register of Citizens. In Assam, protests have been held since Dec. 10, initially turning violent but largely peaceful over the past week.  Assam’s finance minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, told reporters that since Dec. 10, 393 people have been arrested for arson, violence and looting and 10 for “inflammatory” social media posts.

NMC Health shares rebound as it promises independent review of books,Dec 23 2019,"(Reuters) - NMC Health shares leapt about a third in value on Monday, recouping some of their recent losses, after the healthcare group said it would launch an independent review of its finances  following criticism by short-selling firm Muddy Waters. NMC (), the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates, said the review would be undertaken by an unidentified accounting firm and overseen by a committee of independent NMC non-executive directors. Muddy Waters took a short position in NMC last week and questioned the value of its assets and cash balance, as well as reported profits and debts, triggering a plunge in NMC’s shares from over 26 pounds to less than 13 pounds.  The stock was last up 35% at about 17.40 pounds, on track for its biggest ever daily gain.  Short selling involves borrowing an asset and selling it with the aim of buying it back at a cheaper price and making a profit. About 10% of NMC’s outstanding shares were part of short positions as of Dec. 13, according to FIS data. “We are confident that this review, when complete, will be entirely confirmatory of the disclosures provided by the company to date,” NMC said. Muddy Waters said in a statement that NMC should also engage a law firm as part of its review, and make both the scope of the review and the full report by the investigation firm public. NMC, which in 2012 became the first from Abu Dhabi to list on the London Stock Exchange, last week stood by its 2019 and 2020 forecasts, and issued a detailed response to the allegations from Muddy Waters. Muddy Waters, founded by American Carson Block, is known in financial markets for declaring short equity positions on the basis of its in-house research.

Portugal sticks to 0.1% deficit forecast after nine-month surplus,Dec 23 2019,"LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal’s budget surplus widened to 1% of gross domestic product in the first nine months of 2019 from 0.4% a year earlier, the National Statistics Institute said on Monday, but the government said it still expected a small full-year deficit. Speaking to reporters, Finance Minister Mario Centeno said the nine-month surplus reflected solid revenue growth in an expanding economy. But he cautioned that “the budget execution throughout the year is not linear”, with various payments concentrated in the last quarter. “We reiterate the projection we’ve made,” he said, referring to a 0.1% deficit estimated by the government earlier. Last year, the deficit for the whole year was 0.4% - the lowest in more than four decades and a sharp improvement in the country’s financial position from its 2011-14 debt crisis. Next year, the Socialist government expects to post Portugal’s first full-year budget surplus since democracy returned in 1974, of 0.2%, with economic growth remaining steady at 1.9%.

"Protesters rally near Hong Kong harbor, more demos planned over Christmas",Dec 23 2019,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - More than 1,000 protesters, many in surgical masks and balaclavas, filled a harborside plaza near Hong Kong’s financial district late on Monday to demand full democracy and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality. As Hong Kong gears up for Christmas celebrations, the protesters plan wildcat gatherings in prime shopping malls and a ‘silent night’ rally on Tuesday evening. The demonstrators gathered at the harborside on Monday sang “Glory to Hong Kong”, a protest anthem, and shone lights from their mobile phones. Henry, a 28-year-old banker, said he was in the plaza to protest a recent police shutdown of Spark Alliance, a fund-raising platform for protesters. He wore a Guy Fawkes mask from the movie “V for Vendetta”, which glowed green in the dark.  “The Hong Kong government is ruining our reputation as a financial center. How can they say we are a place for finance if they can shut down the fund so unreasonably?” he said. The protests, now in their seventh month, have lost some of the scale and intensity of earlier confrontations. Police have arrested more than 6,000 people since the protests escalated in June, including more than 52 over the past weekend.  Many Hong Kong residents are angry at what they see as Beijing’s meddling in the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies interfering and says it is committed to the ‘one country, two systems’ formula put in place at that time and has blamed foreign forces for fomenting unrest.  On Sunday, a peaceful protest ended in clashes when black-clad, masked demonstrators attacked police with kicks and punches and threw bricks and bottles. Police responded with bursts of pepper spray. One officer drew his pistol and pointed it towards a crowd but didn’t fire, Reuters witnesses said. Protesters plan to gather in five malls on Christmas Eve and will count down to Christmas near the harbor front in the bustling Tsim Sha Tsui district, social media posts say. More protests are planned for Christmas Day on Wednesday. The Civil Human Rights Front, which has organized some of the biggest marches involving more than a million people, has also applied to stage another march on New Year’s Day. Some people taking part in Sunday’s protest called for Hong Kong’s independence from China and removed a Chinese flag from its pole, drawing condemnation from the government. Both the Beijing and Hong Kong governments have made clear such separatist rhetoric will not be tolerated. “Advocating Hong Kong independence ... is not conducive to the overall and long-term interest of Hong Kong society. It is also contrary to the established basic policies of the People’s Republic of China regarding Hong Kong,” the city government said in a statement overnight. While police, including the leader of a major police union, have referred to the protesters as cockroaches, protesters routinely call the police dogs.  On Monday, public broadcaster RTHK broadcast a video of a police public relations officer playing down the significance of the term cockroach. The officer said the term should not be “over-interpreted” because while it may be negative, another way to understand it was that cockroaches were “full of vitality”.

"RPT-Electric vehicle startup Rivian scores $1.3 bln investment from T.Rowe Price, others",Dec 23 2019,"(Repeats to remove word in headline) By Ben Klayman Dec 23 (Reuters) - Electric vehicle startup Rivian said on Monday it closed a $1.3 billion investment round, led by fund manager T. Rowe Price but also including existing investors online retailer Amazon.com Inc and No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co. The investment round, which also included BlackRock Inc, is the fourth this year for Rivian and positions the Plymouth, Michigan-based company as one of the better-financed players in a crowded EV manufacturing market where Tesla Inc is the most established player. “This investment demonstrates confidence in our team, products, technology and strategy,” Rivian Chief Executive R.J. Scaringe said in a statement. Electric vehicles still make up only a small piece of the global automotive market. While Tesla is the best-known maker, China and Europe are pushing automakers to roll out EVs, and Ford, General Motors Co and others have announced plans to spend billions of dollars developing the vehicles. Founded in 2009, Rivian plans to build an all-electric pickup truck, the R1T, and the companion R1S SUV, starting in late 2020. Both models are based on a Rivian-designed “skateboard,” a chassis that bundles electric motor, batteries and controls and can accommodate a variety of body styles. Prior to Monday’s announcement, Rivian had raised $2.2 billion from investors, according to investor website PitchBook, and was valued at an estimated $5 billion to $7 billion. Rivian said on Monday no new board seats were added as a result of the latest investment. T. Rowe Price has placed other bets in the auto sector. It is a large Tesla shareholder and also has invested in GM’s majority-owned Cruise self-driving division. T. Rowe Price also invested, along with Amazon, in self-driving car software startup Aurora and British online food delivery company Deliveroo. Amazon, which has relationships and deals across the auto industry, led a $700 million investment round in Rivian in February. The e-commerce giant also ordered 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian. The first Amazon vans will be built at a former Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Illinois, starting in 2021. Ford invested $500 million in Rivian in April and plans to help it begin production in Normal in 2020. “We want to maintain a meaningful value in the ownership and future of that company,” Ford spokesman T.R. Reid said of Rivian. In November, sources told Reuters a battery-powered Lincoln SUV, due in mid-2022, would be the first Ford vehicle to be built on the Rivian skateboard.

Roche dives deeper into gene therapy with $1.15 billion Sarepta licensing deal,Dec 23 2019,"(Reuters) - Roche Holding AG made its second major gene therapy deal in a year on Monday, spending $1.15 billion to obtain the rights to Sarepta Therapeutics Inc’s investigational drug to treat duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) outside the United States. The Swiss drugmaker closed a $4.3 billion deal to acquire Sparks Therapeutics this month, underscoring the growing appetite among large drugmakers for gene therapies. Roche will make an upfront payment of $750 million in cash and take a $400 million stake in Sarepta, priced at $158.59 per share, a premium of about 26% to the U.S. drugmaker’s closing price on Friday. Shares of Sarepta, which already has non-gene therapies for DMD in the market, were up 9% at $138 before the bell. “This deal should increase confidence in Sarepta’s entire DMD gene therapy program, remove any financing overhang, and allow Sarepta to retain control and flexibility,” Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Alethia Young said in a note. Gene therapies, one of the hottest areas of drug research, aim to correct certain diseases by replacing the missing or mutated version of a gene found in a patient’s cells with healthy copies. Earlier this month, Japan’s Astellas Pharma Inc said it was buying gene therapy developer Audentes Therapeutics Inc for about $3 billion - more than double the U.S. company’s market value at the time. DMD is a rare degenerative neuromuscular disorder, which  affects about one in 3,500-5,000 male births worldwide, causes severe progressive muscle loss and premature death. Sarepta already has a large presence in the DMD market. Its Exondys 51, a non-gene therapy that was approved in 2016, brought in sales of $99 million in the latest quarter. Earlier this month, the company gained a surprise U.S. approval for another DMD drug Vyondys 53. The drugmaker is eligible to receive up to $1.7 billion in regulatory and sales milestones, plus royalties on net sales, Roche said, adding the agreement was expected to close in the first quarter of 2020. Sarepta will continue to be responsible for the clinical development and manufacturing of the gene therapy, SRP-9001, while sharing global clinical development costs equally with Roche. “This deal is as big as it gets for four patients worth of data and only ex-U.S. rights,” Baird analyst Brian Skorney said in a note.

SoftBank's $3 billion WeWork financing talks stall with Japan banks: sources,Dec 23 2019,"TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp’s talks to secure $3 billion from Japan’s three biggest banks have stalled as the lenders have hit internal lending limits to the firm, two people said, complicating a $9.5 billion rescue package for WeWork. The Japanese technology conglomerate is now likely to enter the new year without the WeWork financing in place, the people said, adding the banks are also concerned about the risks involved in rescuing the U.S. office-sharing startup. Mizuho Financial Group Inc, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (MUFG) and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc (SMFG) are seeking ways to provide the financing while offsetting exposure, the people said, declining to be identified because the information is not public. SoftBank did not respond to a request for comment. Mizuho, MUFG and SMFG declined to comment.  One option is to use some of SoftBank’s 26% stake in Chinese e-commerce major Alibaba Group Holding Ltd as collateral, the people said.  “SoftBank is an important client so we want to do everything we can to help, but we have to consider our credit risk,” said a senior banker. The talks illustrate the difficulty SoftBank poses for Japan’s banks. Founder Masayoshi Son’s tech juggernaut has long been a lucrative source of corporate lending in the world’s third-largest economy, where banks typically have to lend at ultra-low interest rates given years of deflation. But SoftBank’s growing debt and turmoil at major bet WeWork earlier this year also highlight the firm’s higher risk profile.  “Banks cannot loosen their credit criteria only for SoftBank,” said S&P Global Ratings senior director Ryoji Yoshizawa.  Another option to spread the risk is a syndicated loan, Yoshizawa said, adding this would be time-consuming - potentially delaying financing. SoftBank in October said it would launch a $9.5 billion bailout of WeWork after the cancellation of the startup’s initial public offering due to investor concerns over its corporate governance and co-founder Adam Neumann’s hard-partying ways. Son has said he turned a blind eye to Neumann’s management, but that the company is still a solid business. The domestic bank deadlock led SoftBank to secure a $1.75 billion line of credit from Goldman Sachs Group Inc, the people said. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. SoftBank has 5.5 trillion yen ($50.28 billion) in outstanding bonds and another 4 trillion yen in bank loans, Refinitiv data showed. Its weighted average cost of debt is 3.7%, the seventh-highest among all companies on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average. Moody’s calculations showed the conglomerate’s interest coverage ratio is 1.3, meaning group income is enough to service its debt, with some left over.

TEXT-Colombia central bank statement on interest rate decision,Dec 21 2019,"BOGOTA, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Colombia’s central bank unanimously held its benchmark interest rate at 4.25% yet again at its meeting on Friday, a rate the bank chief said could remain in place for a “relatively long period” as inflation and growth risks diminish. The following is a Reuters translation of the statement accompanying the bank’s decision: “In this decision, the board mainly considered the following information: In November, annual inflation (3.84%) decreased slightly. Supply shocks that have affected inflation are expected to begin to subside and in early 2020 inflation will resume its convergence to the target, as reflected in market expectations. Basic inflation measures are close to 3%. With new information regarding economic activity, the bank’s technical team maintained the projection of economic growth for 2019 at 3.2%. The outlook for global growth remains moderate and in the United States the Federal Reserve kept its interest rate constant. The projection of the current account deficit for 2019 continues to exceed 4% of gross domestic product and continues to be financed mainly by foreign direct investment. Based on this information, the board considered the following factors in its decision: Transitory deviations of inflation with respect to the target, uncertainty about the persistence of the depreciation of the peso and its degree of transfer to domestic prices. The size of excess productive capacity and the speed with which they are reduced. The effects on the Colombian economy derived from changing external conditions. In this environment, when evaluating the state of the economy and the balance of risks, the board unanimously decided to maintain the reference interest rate at 4.25%. The board will continue to carefully monitor the behavior of inflation and projections of economic activity, as well as the evolution of the current account and the international situation.

The Yankees are coming! U.S. firms rush to euro debt markets,Dec 23 2019,"LONDON (Reuters) - From Harley Davidson to Colgate-Palmolive, U.S. companies are flocking to borrow in euros and their record issuance is breathing life into a market where yields have been hammered by the European Central Bank’s renewed stimulus push. Offshore fundraising by U.S. firms — dubbed the “reverse Yankee” in reference to Yankee bonds, which are sold by foreign entities in the United States — has been a regular feature of the euro debt market. But issuance by non-financial, investment-grade U.S. firms has quadrupled this year from 2018 levels, to around 93 billion euros ($103 billion), Dealogic data shows. That accounted for 27% of a total 346 billion euros ($383 billion) of euro-denominated investment-grade corporate bond issuance, according to the data.  From pharmaceuticals to consumer goods makers to fintech, the reverse Yankee has become the go-to market for U.S. companies which are now the largest source of corporate bond sales in Europe, according to BofA.  And if the boom extends into 2020, the United States would become the largest country in the ICE-BofA euro zone corporate debt index, overtaking France, the bank says.  The rush is driven primarily by rock-bottom borrowing costs in the euro zone, where interest rates are at minus 0.5% and the average yield on corporate euro-denominated bonds has fallen to 0.48% — down from 1.25% at the start of 2019. European credit markets offer “the best funding conditions for global issuers” said BofA’s head of credit strategy Barnaby Martin. “They’re not going to be able to find that anywhere else.”  Euro issuance allows U.S. borrowers to replace high-coupon, shorter-dated dollar debt with longer, lower-coupon euro debt. That lowers financing costs and improves the results of companies with euro-denominated assets, said Marc Baigneres, head of Western Europe investment-grade finance at JPMorgan. Mergers and acquisitions are another factor — fintech Fidelity National Information Services, for example, raised 5 billion euros back in May as part of a multi-currency deal to finance its purchase of card payment firm Worldpay. Graphic: Share of outstanding euro-denominated debt  The reverse Yankee boom is welcome news for European bond buyers dismayed at the yield collapse triggered by the ECB’s asset purchase program.  The euro zone’s central bank, which resumed buying bonds in October, holds 183 billion euros of corporate debt. Toward the end of quantitative easing a year ago, it was estimated to hold a fifth of the eligible corporate debt stock.  Because reverse Yankees are not usually eligible for ECB purchases, they often carry higher yields than similarly rated euro zone issues. They also made up a significant chunk of this year’s longer-maturity debt, including half the 30-year corporate bonds sold, according to Refinitiv.  These longer, higher-yield issues are especially popular with investors. Triple B-rated reverse Yankee bonds of seven to 10 years’ maturity can offer a spread of up to 25 basis points more than euro zone equivalents that are eligible for ECB purchase, research company CreditSights calculates.  BofA’s Martin reckons U.S. names could lure giant Asian life insurers to invest in euro debt. These investors hold over 10% of the U.S. credit market, International Monetary Fund data shows, but they are less familiar with euro zone companies. “If many of the U.S. issuers come in euro format, it’s easier for (insurers) to buy euro investment-grade,” Martin said. “It will create additional demand and it will be bullish for the market.”  Graphic: Reverse Yankee bond issuance jumps in 2019  With the ECB expected to stick with stimulus and the U.S. Federal Reserve not cutting rates for now, analysts predict reverse Yankee issuance will exceed 2019 levels next year. Companies such as Amazon and Visa which have significant euro revenues but no euro debt could tap the market, said BofA, which expects reverse Yankees’ share of the index to rise to 20.8% by November 2020, from the current 18%. But the greater presence of American companies could create additional risk, warns Rachid Semaoune, a credit fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, because U.S. corporate behavior differs from that of European peers. Commerzbank estimates that U.S. firms had a free cash flow level of around minus $300 billion in 2018 — the ninth straight year of negative flows. That is a measure of how much cash a company will have after capital spending to pay bond and equity investors.  The figure in Europe was around zero. “It’s a worry because U.S. corporates are a lot more aggressive in their financial policy, and in terms of shareholder returns, either in the form of share buybacks and special dividends, which are detrimental to bondholders,” Semaoune said.

"UCore, Materion team up to apply for U.S. military rare earths funding",Dec 23 2019,"(Reuters) - Rare earths miner UCore Rare Metals Inc and manufacturer Materion Corp said on Monday they will form a consortium to jointly apply for U.S. military funding of a rare earths processing plant.  Reuters reported earlier this month that the U.S. Department of Defense plans to fund construction of rare earths processing facilities, part of a push by Washington to ensure its military has adequate supply of the minerals used to make weapons and electronics. The Pentagon plans to pick one or more winners to receive funding to build a pilot plant to process so-called heavy rare earths, a less-common type of the specialized minerals used in weaponry.      UCore and Materion are effectively betting that by merging their areas of expertise, their application will be more appealing to the Pentagon. “We believe that the combination of our experience and breadth of knowledge presents a winning opportunity,” said Lawrence Ryczek, Materion’s vice president of aerospace and defense.   Texas Mineral Resources Corp and a joint venture between Australia’s Lynas Corp and privately held Blue Line Corp of Texas also plan to apply. Lynas and Blue Line earlier this year announced their partnership, one that served as a model for UCore and Materion’s consortium.  “We were looking for something that would put us directly in the same league as Lynas with this value proposition, and we’ve done that,” said Jim McKenzie, chief executive of UCore, which is developing a rare earths mine in Alaska.  The U.S. military’s request does not give a specific financial amount for the award, though it is derived in part from the Defense Production Act (DPA), a 1950s-era U.S. law that gives the Pentagon wide financial latitude to procure equipment necessary for the national defense. Beyond finances, whomever is chosen is expected to receive a large public relations boost and become recognized in the rare earths industry as one capable of meeting the U.S. military’s high standards.  The deadline to apply is Monday. Materion has previously received financial support from the U.S. military to produce beryllium, a mineral used as a hardening agent for weapons. The beryllium production process has similarities to rare earths processing.  “We have a track record of taking a concept on paper, meeting the requirements of the (U.S.) military and taking the project to fruition,” said Materion’s Ryczek.    “There’s no reason why we can’t help the (U.S.) rare earths supply chain be successful as well.” ","{'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.877, 'pos': 0.099, 'compound': 0.9799}",0.9799

The index closed flat after hitting a new record earlier in the session, aided by a ninth straight day of rise for Britain's FTSE 100  and defensive buying that boosted Europe's healthcare stocks .SXDP and Swiss equities index .  “Unsurprisingly, there has not been much news to drive the market forward, but hopes of a U.S.-China deal continue to be dangled like a carrot in front of investors,” Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG wrote in a client note. U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said Washington and Beijing would “very shortly” sign their so-called Phase One trade pact. Giving investors more reason to cheer, China’s finance ministry said on Monday it would lower tariffs next year on U.S. products ranging from frozen pork and avocado to some types of semiconductors. However, trade-sensitive German  and French  shares moved little on the news. The star performers were UK mid-cap shares , which jumped 0.8% and the blue-chip index , which gained 0.5%, as investors stuck to hopes that Britain will exit the European Union by 2020. NMC (), whose shares have nearly halved in value since last week after Muddy Waters criticized the healthcare group’s financials, shot up 37% after launching an independent review of its books. Shares in aerospace parts makers such as Senior Plc (), Melrose Industries () and Meggitt () rose between 1.3% and 2.8% after U.S. planemaker Boeing Co () ousted Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg following a production halt of its best-selling 737 MAX jetliner after two fatal crashes.  Eurozone banks .SX7E dropped about 1%. European Central Bank’s (ECB) governing council member Klaas Knot said interest rates in the euro zone could remain historically low for years, but the ECB’s ultra-loose monetary policy risks becoming counterproductive. A 4.9% decline for Italian infrastructure group Atlantia () pressured the wider country index . On Saturday, a report said the Italian government had provisionally approved a document to make it easier to revoke concessions to operate motorways. The decree does not mention Atlantia, but a government source told Reuters that the measures could be applied to it.     Lufthansa () dropped 1.3% after German cabin crew union UFO said arbitration talks with the company had failed and its members could stage strikes any time from now on, barring Dec. 24, 25 and 26.

RPT-UPDATE 1-ICBC Standard aborts plan to shut base metals unit,Dec 23 2019,"(Repeats story that ran late on Friday, with no changes to text) By Florence Tan and Pratima Desai SINGAPORE/LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - ICBC Standard Bank has abandoned proposals to shut its base metals business and instead plans to merge it with the precious metals unit to cut costs, the bank told Reuters in an emailed statement. The bank, a joint venture between Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Africa’s largest lender Standard Bank, is a major participant in base metals markets globally. It is restructuring after posting a net loss of almost $130 million in first-half 2019 and in early November mooted the idea of cutting jobs and shutting its base metals trading and equities businesses. “Following feedback from our clients and shareholders, we will be maintaining our base metals capabilities, whilst achieving some operating efficiencies by merging our precious and base metals business lines,” ICBC Standard Bank said. A staff memo dated Dec. 9 seen by Reuters and sources with direct knowledge of the matter said the U-turn came after objections from majority shareholder ICBC, which controls 60% of ICBC Standard Bank. One source said the attraction for ICBC when it bought into the joint venture in 2015 was the base metals business, which includes trading derivatives and physical markets, and trade finance. The memo stated that the bank still planned to close its equities business. “The discussions have not resulted in any change to the equities proposed closure,” it said, adding that the bank will proceed with efforts to cut costs and headcount. ICBC Standard Bank decline to comment directly on the memo. When ICBC invested in Standard’s commodities business, the South African lender had built up the strongest physical presence among Western banks in China and was an active member of the London Metal Exchange. Late in 2017, ICBC Standard hired Tim Wilson to build the business. Wilson had previously run Standard Chartered’s commodity marketing and sales business out of Singapore and worked for JPMorgan. However, in its mid-year 2019 financial report, ICBC Standard said its base metals business had underperformed, hit by the impact of the U.S.-China trade on markets. “They’ve extended the period for making people redundant by between three and six months, depending on their function,” one source with direct knowledge of the matter said. “This gives them the option to keep people on depending on what they decide to do with base metals, what shape the new (business) offering might take.” ","{'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.92, 'pos': 0.049, 'compound': 0.8225}",0.8225
Weak economy cuts number of South African companies paying tax,Dec 23 2019,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Nearly half of companies in South Africa had no taxable income in 2017 while a quarter recorded a taxable loss, the South African Revenue service said on Monday, based on its latest 2017/18 data, highlighting the impact of weak economic growth. The revenue service said based on its 2017 data, 48.3% of companies had taxable income equal to zero, 27.4% reported an assessed loss, and 24.3% had positive taxable income. Companies have up to 12 months from the end of their financial cycles to submit tax returns. “The decline can largely be attributed to sluggish economic growth, structural challenges in some sectors of the economy, low confidence levels and political uncertainty,” the revenue service said.  “All of these factors play a role in subdued investment activity, resulting in lower profitability for companies.” In the revenue service’s 2019 Tax Statistics, which measures revenue collection from 2014/15 to 2018/19 fiscal years, revenue collection for the current year ended March reached 1.287 trillion rand ($90.25 billion), short of a target of 1.302 trillion rand. The collector said companies submitting returns had fallen 36.9% to just over 2 million for the 2018/19 fiscal year, partly due to many being considered “inactive or dormant”, while only 63.4%, or 572,000, of companies expected to submit returns had complied. Tax revenues have fallen sharply in South Africa since 2015 due to weak economic growth and maladministration. In addition, nationwide electricity blackouts, forcing mines and small businesses to shut down, have put more pressure on the economy and government finances. In October, the National Treasury said the budget deficit would jump to 5.9% of gross domestic product by 2020, its highest since 2009/10, and likely reach a 6.5% deficit in 2021, well above government’s target of 4.5%.

Exclusive: India's HDFC Bank taps Egon Zehnder to identify Aditya Puri's successor,Jan 23 2020,"MUMBAI () - India's HDFC Bank () has chosen global executive search firm Egon Zehnder to identify a successor to managing director Aditya Puri, the country's top private lender said on Thursday.  had reported earlier on Thursday that the HDFC Bank board had tapped the global head-hunting firm in a bid to end a boardroom impasse over Puri's successor and zero in on a candidate. Four sources familiar with the discussions told  that a six-member internal search committee, appointed in November last year, has been unable to reach a consensus on selecting a successor to Puri, who has been at the helm of HDFC Bank since its inception in 1994. “Egon Zehnder has been recommended by the search committee and unanimously appointed by the bank's board,” Neeraj Jha, a spokesman for HDFC Bank, said in an email. Puri, whose term comes to an end in October this year, is also an adviser to the search committee.  “The latest decision to hire a global advisory firm has been taken after the search committee members realized that they have been struggling to come to a consensus on the final name,” said a source familiar with the internal deliberations among members of the committee.  “The deadline for Puri's successor is nearing ... the bank will have to appoint someone who can continue to push for growth despite an economic slowdown,” the source added. According to HDFC Bank, Puri is 69 years old.  As per regulations, the bank will need to get approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), before any new appointment can be confirmed. HDFC Bank is one of three domestic lenders that the central bank has designated as “too big to fail”.   Egon Zehnder, which declined to comment on the matter, had in 2018 also helped Axis Bank (), another private lender, to find its chief executive officer.  A second source at HDFC said the differences between the top leadership over the succession has been the crucial reason for the delay in identifying a new managing director. The sources said Puri and Deepak Parekh, the chairman of India's largest housing finance company HDFC () which owns a minority stake in the bank, have been at loggerheads over the bank's succession plan, with both advocating their preferred candidates to secure the job. Puri's preferred choices include HDFC Bank's executive directors Bhavesh Zaveri, Sashidhar Jagdishan and Kaizad Bharucha, said three of the sources. Two of those sources also said Parekh has been rooting to reinstate Paresh Sukhtankar, who resigned as Puri's deputy in 2018.  Sukhtankar, who joined the bank alongside Puri in 1994 was widely expected to be Puri's successor. Reasons behind his departure remain unclear. Regarding questions about names in the fray and differences between Puri and Parekh, HDFC Bank's Jha said that “information is speculative and incorrect”.  Parekh and Puri personally did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. Sources said the search committee, in a bid to defuse the tension, had also contacted top banking executives working overseas to find a candidate acceptable to Puri and Parekh. The board members held preliminary discussions with Indian-origin bankers Piyush Gupta, CEO of DBS Group (), and Ajay Banga, CEO of Mastercard Inc (), about the job, two of the sources said.  The outcome of these discussions was unclear. A spokesman at DBS Group told  in an email that “Piyush is happy at DBS and has no plans to leave”. Seth Eisen, senior vice president of communications at Mastercard, said Banga has not had any conversation with HDFC Bank regarding the position. Analysts tracking the bank said Puri has run it with an iron hand, preventing it from accruing a high level of bad loans at a time when most of its peers were struggling.  “The new successor needs to have a vision to be able to spot opportunities and constantly stay ahead of the curve which is what Puri has been doing,” said Suresh Ganapathy, head of financial services research at Macquarie. Puri, the highest paid banker in India with remuneration of 136.7 million rupees ($1.92 million) excluding stock options, had been seeking another term as managing director, two of the sources said. However, the central bank has been firm that chief executives of private banks must retire at the age of 70. ","{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.903, 'pos': 0.065, 'compound': 0.9493}",0.9493
Italian PM Conte pulls out of Davos trip amid political turmoil,Jan 23 2020,"ROME () - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte canceled a planned trip to the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos on Thursday, a day after the head of the co-governing 5 Star Movement resigned, piling pressure on his divided coalition. The prime minister's office gave no detailed reason for the cancellation of the trip but said Conte would be remaining in Rome to work on “urgent issues”. Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, who has been in government since the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement won 33% of the national vote in the 2018 election, quit on Wednesday following a wave of defections that had threatened the stability of the government. His resignation had added to growing political uncertainty in Italy ahead of local elections at the weekend where the right-wing opposition League party is hoping for big gains to add weight to its demands for new national elections. Italian government bonds have remained steady and on Thursday, Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri said the ruling coalition remained strongly committed to government stability and that the 5-Star Movement had assured its support. “The party's already said it was committed to the stability of the government. So nothing will change,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. Di Maio, who remains in office as foreign minister, has been replaced as caretaker by the head of 5-Star's internal rules committee Vito Crimi, until a permanent successor is chosen at a party conference in the next few months. The party has been hit by a series of high profile defections from its parliamentary party, losing more than 30 lawmakers since 2018, amid deep disagreements on policies including its partnership with the centre-left Democratic Party.

Xerox nominates new HP board after buyout rebuffs,Jan 23 2020,"() - Xerox Holdings Corp said on Thursday it plans to nominate 11 independent candidates to HP Inc's board, seeking to take control of the personal computer maker after several rejections of its $33.5 billion buyout offer. The U.S. printer maker made the cash-and-stock offer to HP, a company more than three times its size, in November. HP's board rejected the offer saying it significantly undervalued the company. “HP shareholders have told us they believe our acquisition proposal will bring tremendous value, which is why we lined up $24 billion in binding financing commitments and a slate of highly qualified director candidates,” John Visentin, Xerox's CEO, said on Thursday. HP, which has 12 board members, responded to Xerox's decision to nominate candidates by again saying the bid undervalues the company. The company added that the move to nominate members to its board was being “driven” by activist investor Carl Icahn, who has a 4.2% stake in HP and a 10.9% stake in Xerox. In December, Icahn urged HP shareholders who agreed to the merger to reach out to the PC maker's directors for immediate action.  The PC maker also said that due to Icahn's ownership position, he would stand to “disproportionately benefit” if a deal between the companies happens. “These nominations are a self-serving tactic by Xerox to advance its proposal, which significantly undervalues HP and creates meaningful risk to the detriment of HP shareholders,” HP said in a statement. HP added that its board would review Xerox's director nominees and respond in due course. Xerox's slate of candidates include current or former executives from companies such as American Airlines, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Jefferies and Wynn Resorts. Both HP and Xerox have been facing a decline in demand as corporate clients choose to send emails rather than print out documents. While some Wall Street analysts have said a merger would help the companies in a declining printing market, others have cited challenges to integration, given their different offerings and pricing models. “I don't think (the nomination) puts enough pressure on HP to agree to a merger, but it may cause HP to consider negotiations for a higher valuation from Xerox,” Morningstar analyst Mark Cash said.   Shares of Xerox were down marginally at $36.24 while HP was up 0.8% to $22.10. ","{'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.93, 'pos': 0.047, 'compound': 0.6187}",0.6187
Portugal investigates firms co-owned by dos Santos; Angola may seek arrest warrant,Jan 23 2020,"LISBON () - Portugal's market watchdog has launched inquiries into various firms where Angolan billionaire Isabel dos Santos holds stakes, after Angola's chief prosecutor said she could face an international arrest warrant if she fails to cooperate in a fraud investigation. Angola has named dos Santos, the daughter of former President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, as a suspect over alleged mismanagement and misappropriation of funds while she was chairwoman of state oil firm Sonangol in 2016-2017.  In a statement sent to , Santos denied any wrongdoing and said she would “seek to clarify our position in relation to the latest accusations”. “I have always operated within the law and all my commercial transactions have been approved by lawyers, banks, auditors and regulators,” she said.  In Portugal, Angola's former colonial power, dos Santos holds significant stakes in several important firms.  Gabriela Figueiredo Dias, the head of Portugal's market regulator CMVM, said it had launched inquiries earlier this week into two of those companies, oil company Galp Energia and telecoms firm NOS, and into unspecified auditing firms. Galp declined to comment and a NOS spokesman said the company had no comment so far. Angola's chief prosecutor was quoted by Portugal's Lusa news agency as saying late on Wednesday, before traveling to Lisbon on Thursday, that his office sought dos Santos and other suspects “to voluntarily come to face justice”. Failing that, his office would resort to legal instruments at its disposal, one being an international warrant. Portuguese newspaper Expresso said several people linked to dos Santos were also named as formal suspects, including Nuno Ribeiro da Cunha, director of private banking at small Portuguese lender Eurobic and manager of Sonangol's account at the bank. Police said on Thursday Ribeiro da Cunha was found dead at the garage of his house in Lisbon on Wednesday night, after apparently committing suicide by hanging. He had tried to commit suicide earlier this month, police said.      No one at Eurobic was immediately available for comment.  Eurobic, in which dos Santos has owned a large stake, said on Wednesday she had decided to sell the stake.   The CMVM regulator said it wanted to find out if there is any relevant information that Galp and NOS should have provided to CMVM but did not.  Figueiredo Dias said hundreds of thousands of files about dos Santos, dubbed the “Luanda Leaks” and released on Sunday, were of “enormous importance” for the market regulator. The documents were obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and released by several news organizations.     The media reports focused on alleged financial schemes used by dos Santos to build her business empire, including transfers between Angola and Dubai. Dos Santos, who has been living abroad, said on Sunday that allegations made against her were “completely unfounded”. The scandal has led to several resignations, including Mario Leite da Silva, who resigned as chairman of Banco Fomento Angola on Monday, according to a letter seen by .  Silva, who could not immediately be reached for comment, also stepped down from his position as non-executive board member at Portuguese telecoms company NOS, where dos Santos holds a significant stake.  Two other non-executive board members at NOS resigned on Thursday, the company said in a statement.  Separately, auditors PwC said the firm had “taken action to terminate any ongoing work for entities controlled by members of the dos Santos family” following what it said were “very serious and concerning allegations”, and had begun an inquiry. Dos Santos has said allegations against her are politically motivated.  Authorities in Angola froze dos Santos' assets there in late December. Asked about dos Santos' case at the World Economic Forum, Angolan Finance Minister Vera Daves told  “we need to send signs to society that we are committed to tackle corruption” and to manage public money and firms well. President Joao Lourenco, who succeeded dos Santos's father in 2017, has cracked down on the role of his predecessor's children, firing dos Santos from her job chairing Sonangol and her brother from the sovereign wealth fund.

Incoming Bank of England chief to face questions over investment firm collapse,Jan 23 2020,"LONDON () - Bank of England governor-designate Andrew Bailey will be interviewed about his supervision of collapsed investment firm London Capital & Finance as head of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), an independent inquiry said on Thursday. LCF collapsed in January 2019, leaving 11,600 bondholders nursing losses of up to 237 million pounds  ($312 million). It was selling “mini-bonds” that raise cash for small firms.  The bonds were not regulated by the FCA, which Bailey heads, but LCF itself and marketing material were. Elizabeth Gloster, a barrister selected to head the inquiry, said the process of gathering documents for her investigation was nearing completion and the next stage was to interview officials at the FCA. Gloster told a meeting of over 100 bondholders that Bailey has been chief executive of the watchdog for almost all of the period that LCF was authorised. Bailey is due to take up his new post as governor of the Bank of England in March. Bailey has already assured her he will be available, Gloster added, declining to say when the interview would take place. Her report is due to be delivered in July.   The FCA will be required to set out key findings, lessons learned and any actions being taken, she added. The FCA declined to comment.  Britain's Serious Fraud Office is also investigating the collapse of LCF. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme said this month it planned to compensate only 159 bondholders who the body believed ‘were given misleading advice by LCF'.  Gloster said her remit does not cover whether bondholders should be compensated but her conclusions will inform the  government about whether compensation should be paid. “I am personally very conscious of the huge personal and financial impact on many of the LCF investors as a result of the collapse,” Gloster said. “We received very sad letters and emails from a very large number of bondholders, some of which make very distressing reading.”  ","{'neg': 0.083, 'neu': 0.89, 'pos': 0.027, 'compound': -0.9629}",-0.9629
"Lebanon to seek up to $5bln in soft loans, prime minister rallies support",Jan 23 2020,"BEIRUT () - Lebanon's new government must reassure international donors it is serious about reforms to tackle a financial crisis as it looks initially to secure up to $5 billion in soft loans for basic goods, its finance minister said on Thursday. The government that took office on Tuesday faces an emergency in which banks have imposed controls, the Lebanese pound has weakened and protesters have turned to violence which a senior U.N. official described as “politically manipulated”. “The entire international community has its eye on what this government will do,” Finance Minister Ghazi Wazni said in televised comments. “What is its programme, what are the reform steps, is it ready for support or no?” Lebanon is looking to secure $4 billion to $5 billion in soft loans from international donors to finance purchases of wheat, fuel and medicines, The Daily Star newspaper had earlier quoted the minister as saying.  “This injection will cover the country's needs for one year,” said Wazni. Bank restrictions on access to cash, inflation and job losses have hit people hard. Increasingly violent though more limited protests have replaced jubilant demonstrations against a political elite blamed for driving Lebanon towards collapse. Interior minister Mohammed Fahmi said the state would not tolerate attacks on security forces who he said would protect people's rights, including freedom of expression. On Wednesday, protesters broke stone slabs off buildings in a luxury commercial district of Beirut to hurl at barricades guarded by security forces blocking paths to parliament.  “This looks more like a political manipulation to provoke the security forces, to undermine civil peace, to fan up sectarian strife,” Jan Kubis, U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon, wrote on Twitter, mentioning attacks on security forces and vandalism of state institutions and private property. The new government was set up with backing from the powerful Iran-backed group Hezbollah and its political allies. Major political parties that have Western backing, including that of former premier Saad al-Hariri, are not part of the cabinet. Analysts say the influence of Hezbollah over the cabinet may complicate its attempt to secure foreign funding, particularly from Gulf Arab states that have provided aid in the past but see Hezbollah as a threat. Hezbollah's parliamentary bloc urged the government to hasten its rescue programme. The cabinet has formed a committee to draft a policy statement to be presented to parliament. Prime Minister Hassan Diab met several foreign ambassadors as the heavily indebted government looks to rally support. It must decide how to deal with maturing Eurobonds, including a $1.2 billion bond due in March. Diab's office said British Ambassador Chris Rampling conveyed Britain's readiness to support Lebanon but that the government “must show its commitment to reform that Lebanon needs urgently”. The European Union's ambassador to Lebanon, Ralph Tarraf, said he had agreed with Diab on the need for Lebanon to “focus on economic files, address the crisis and institute structural reforms”, two local media outlets reported. Foreign governments and institutions have demanded Lebanon enact long-delayed reforms to curb state waste and corruption before any new financial support is released. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday only a government “capable and committed to undertaking real and tangible reforms will restore investor confidence and unlock international assistance.” Lebanon won pledges exceeding $11 billion for a programme of infrastructure investment at a 2018 international conference, conditional on such reforms.

M&A strong though Chinese buyers lacking: Citigroup's Kalvaria,Jan 23 2020,"() - Geopolitical uncertainties are not deterring Citigroup Inc clients from strategic deals and some unicorns' offer “great potential”, but outbound Chinese buyers are lacking, Leon Kalvaria, chairman of the lender's institutional clients group said.  Kalvaria also told the  Global Markets Forum on Thursday that Citi's overall market share across advisory, syndicate lending, equity and debt origination rose in 2019, but  attracting and retaining talent is challenging in the business. Below are excerpts from the chat, held on the sidelines of  the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland:  Question (Q) - Is geopolitical uncertainty keeping some corporate clients, who would otherwise be looking for deals or other financing, on the sidelines?  Answer (A) - I don't think geopolitical uncertainties are affecting clients who are looking to do strategic transactions. However, that said, obviously outbound mergers and acquisitions (M&A) from China has gone down considerably, but other cross border M&A remains reasonably strong.   Q - Many of Citigroup's competitors are going down market to look for growth since there is more competition for the biggest deals but fewer of them. Why hasn't Citi followed suit?   A - We are not going down market because we do not believe that's the right phraseology. What we are doing is spending significant time on smaller emerging growth companies, which we believe, over time, will be winners within their sub-sectors. Those companies are candidates for initial public offerings, merger and acquisition (M&A) opportunities and other potential services that we can bring to bear as they grow globally.  Q - How has the era of “unicorns” changed the way Citigroup sources new clients?  A - The era of unicorns relates to the earlier question about covering smaller companies. The unicorn valuations help highlight companies with great potential for us to cover and are very helpful in the areas we should invest in from the people standpoint.  Q - In 2018, Citi's overall market share across advisory, syndicate lending and equity and debt origination rose to 5.1%, from 4.9%. How is the effort to capture more market share progressing and what are the biggest hurdles?   A - We continue to increase market share in 2019 slowly and carefully. The hurdles remain in retaining and attracting the best talent. This is a people business and we have to ensure that we have the best. Q - How will the corporate banking landscape change, given recent consolidation in the capital markets industry. Will fewer players in equity or debt impact the other corporate banking business lines?  A - Corporate banking business will remain a broad global business. Obviously the big 3 American corporate banks continue to enjoy a very strong position in the marketplace and remain very strong. But they (face) competition from leading banks in Asia and Europe.  In terms of fixed income and equities, some players have retreated to some extent and that has given other players the opportunity to pick up market share.

"France, U.S. agree to push global 'digital tax' talks forward",Jan 23 2020,"DAVOS, Switzerland () - France and the United States agreed on Thursday how to press ahead with a global rewrite of cross-border tax rules for the digital era, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said. Le Maire said he and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had set aside a bilateral dispute over France's digital tax on big tech companies to focus on securing a broader global deal this year that would include a minimal corporate tax rate. The two hammered out a series of written proposals for the first redrafting of international tax rules since the 1920s that will be put to 137 governments when discussions start next week at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. “We had long talks this morning with the U.S. Treasury Secretary and the OECD Secretary General, and I am happy to announce to you that we have found an agreement between France and the United States, providing the basis for work on digital taxation at the OECD,” Le Maire said at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos. “It's good news, because it reduces the risk of American sanctions and opens up the prospect of an international solution on digital taxation,” he added. Preparations led in part by France and the United States to launch the OECD talks had been eclipsed by their bilateral row with Washington threatening retaliatory tariffs against Paris' own national tax on big tech companies that book out-sized profits on French income, despite a minimal physical presence. U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron had discussed the issue in a phone call on Sunday. OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria has been working for years on finding ways to create a level playing field on digital taxation. Those efforts are now being accelerated to see if an agreement can be reached by December. Speaking on a panel at Davos with Le Maire, Gurria said he was hopeful of securing a draft framework by July. “We have no Plan B — we just have to get it done,” he said. Other countries including Italy and Britain are also pursuing or imposing their own national digital-tax regimes. Le Maire said it was preferable to have an international framework rather than a proliferation of national digital taxes. France has said it will scrap its own tax if an international accord can be reached. “So we have to build something different and that's exactly what we want to do during 2020.” France's existing digital tax is based on turnover. But Le Maire admitted that was not optimal from an economic point of view, saying the OECD's plan to tax profits was more sound. There will be intense discussion over what level of profit would be taxed and how it would be collected. After meeting Mnuchin, Le Maire said a U.S. proposal that any deal be optional for companies was no longer on the table. ","{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.853, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.988}",0.988

France uses Davos to pursue global 'digital tax' goal,Jan 23 2020,"DAVOS, Switzerland () - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire is optimistic of reaching a deal on a global tax on digital companies, despite an initial failure to agree one with the United States. “We are moving in the right direction,” Le Maire told  TV at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos on Thursday, adding that he thought France was close to striking an agreement with the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed the issue in a phone call on Sunday, with both sides sounding positive afterwards, in contrast to the threats the U.S. has made to impose tariffs on exports of champagne and other luxury goods in retaliation for a French digital tax. But Paris and Washington failed to agree on Wednesday on how to push forward on a deal that involves a rewriting of decades-old cross-border tax rules. They did, however, agree to set aside their squabbling as they work on the global initiative. This is being led by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a Paris-based club of wealthier economies.  OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria has been working for years on finding ways to create a level playing field on digital taxation, but those efforts are now being accelerated to see if an agreement can be reached by December. Speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum with Le Maire, Gurria said he was hopeful of having a framework that would apply to more than 130 countries drafted by July. “We have no Plan B — we just have to get it done,” he said. Le Maire has thrust France front and center of the digital taxation debate, despite the fact several countries, including Italy and Britain, are already pursuing or imposing their own national digital-tax regimes. “It would be far better to have an international framework for everybody,” Le Maire said on Thursday, adding that otherwise the world would end up with a cacophony of national systems that would compound the problem. “So we have to build something different and that's exactly what we want to do during 2020, by building on the extremely good work being done (at the OECD).” France's existing digital tax is based on turnover. But Le Maire admitted that was not optimal from an economic point of view, saying the OECD's plan to tax profits was more sound. There will be intense discussion over what level of profit would be taxed and how it would be collected. “Everything is on the table,” Le Maire said. “We just have to decide if we want to avoid a loophole in the international taxation system or have many national solutions that would be detrimental to all of us.  “We just can't go on any longer with a taxation system in which the richest companies, those that are making the biggest profits, are paying the least tax.” ","{'neg': 0.037, 'neu': 0.834, 'pos': 0.129, 'compound': 0.9904}",0.9904
Tanzanian home affairs minister fired over $453 million contract,Jan 23 2020,"DAR ES SALAAM () - Tanzanian President John Magufuli fired his home affairs minister Kangi Lugola on Thursday, accusing him of mismanaging a 408 million euro ($453 million) fire department contract. Magufuli, who faces re-election for a second five-year term this year, has cultivated the image of a hard-nosed leader who swiftly fires ministers and officials who do not toe his line. The fire department, which falls under the home affairs ministry, had signed the contract with an unnamed Romanian firm without involving the finance ministry or securing parliamentary approval, Magufuli said.  “The major issue here is the lack of integrity,” he told a government event in the commercial capital Dar es Salaam. “They have signed a Memorandum of Understanding but within the contract it has been stipulated that to terminate the contract, all activities that had been implemented will continue to be implemented.” The deal was for the purchase of fire fighting and rescue equipment, Magufuli's office said in a statement. Lugola said he accepted the president's decision to relieve him of his cabinet post. “The president is the one who appointed me in the cabinet of ministers and he is the one who has relieved me from the cabinet,” he told reporters. “I will continue to support him and his government with due respect.” Other officials named in the deal, including the commissioner general of the fire department, had no immediate comment.

Egypt's economic outlook improves in 2020- Poll,Jan 23 2020,"CAIRO () - Egypt's economy is likely to grow 5.8% in the current fiscal year ending on June 30, and 5.9% in 2020/21, according to a  poll - an improvement on the previous poll three months ago. The median of forecasts from 20 economists polled from Jan. 7 to 21 aligns with the 5.8%-5.9% growth forecast by the finance ministry for 2019/20 on Monday. In 2018/19, GDP grew 5.6%. In October, analysts had projected the economy would expand by only 5.5% in 2019/20 and 5.7% in 2020/21. “We expect a slight increase in household consumption accompanied by higher exports and lower imports,” Naeem Brokerage Allen Sandeep said, explaining the more optimistic outlook. Egypt's economy has been boosted in the last three years by an upswing in tourism, strong remittances from Egyptian workers abroad and recently discovered natural gas fields coming onstream. But the growth has mainly been driven by the state sector, with the non-oil private sector having contracted every month this fiscal year apart from July, according to the IHS Markit Egypt Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI). In fact, non-oil private sector growth has expanded in only six individual months since a 2016 economic reform programme tied to a $12 billion three-year International Monetary Fund accord, according to the PMI data. Completed in November, the program was designed to reduce Egypt's budget and current account deficits. The reforms included letting the Egyptian pound depreciate sharply, removing almost all fuel subsidies, introducing a value-added tax and raising electricity and transport prices. The analysts expected Egypt's annual urban consumer price inflation to slow to 6.8% in 2019/20 but to rebound to 7.5% in 2020/21 and 8.0% the following year. In July 2017, months after the IMF-inspired austerity measures kicked in, inflation peaked at 33%.  Egypt reported that inflation had increased by an annual 7.1% in December after having slowed to as little as 3.1% in October.  “December 2019's inflation print confirms our expectation that prices will continue to accelerate in months to come as favorable base effects diminish,” said Callee Davis of NKC African.  The median analyst forecast had the Egyptian pound weakening to 16.10 to the U.S. dollar by the end of June from 15.80 on Thursday. It will slide further to 16.50 by June 2021 and 17.08 by June 2022, the analysts predicted. Davis forecast that the currency's strong appreciation over the last 12 months would begin to reverse this coming April 2020, when a $1 billion Eurobond repayment is scheduled.  The poll also suggested that the central bank would lower its key overnight lending rates, currently 13.25%, to 11.75% in 2020 and 10.75% in 2021 and 2022. Last week, the bank left its overnight interest rates unchanged after cutting them at each of its previous three meetings.

UK inquiry into collapse of LCF to interview FCA's Bailey,Jan 23 2020,"LONDON, Jan 23 () - Bank of England governor-designate Andrew Bailey will be interviewed about his supervision of collapsed investment firm London Capital & Finance, an independent inquiry said on Thursday. LCF collapsed in January 2019, leaving 11,600 bondholders nursing losses of up to 237 million pounds. It was selling “mini-bonds” that raise cash for small firms. The bonds were not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, which Bailey heads, but LCF itself and marketing material were. Elizabeth Gloster, a barrister selected to head the inquiry, said the process of gathering documents for her investigation was nearing completion and the next stage was to interview officials at the FCA. Gloster told a meeting of about 100 bondholders that Bailey has been chief executive of the watchdog for almost all of the period that LCF was authorised. Bailey is due to take up his new post as governor of the Bank of England in March. “We will be interviewing Mr Bailey,” Gloster said. Gloster said efforts to gather documents on LCF from the FCA had met with an “unexpected delay”, but her report is expected to be delivered on time in July. Meeting the July deadline relies on outstanding information being provided by the FCA in timely fashion, Gloster said, adding that there would be no interim report as this could distract from the conclusions of the final report.

DAVOS-Italian non-performing loans yielding healthy returns - Investcorp,Jan 23 2020,"Jan 23 () - Non-performing loans (NPL) bought from Italian banks and held on average for two years have yielded net percentage returns in the mid-teens, Hazem Ben-Gacem, co-chief executive of alternative asset manager Investcorp said on Thursday. Ben-Gacem also told the  Global Markets Forum that he hopes to build on a new $130 million fund providing so-called last-mile financing for developers in India's troubled real estate sector. Below are excerpts from the interview, conducted on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland: Question (Q) - Investcorp's latest quarterly update  mentioned large inflows into the Italian NPL II product. Can you please run us through your process of evaluating investments for this product? Answer (A) - In Italy, we identified the need for many of the major local banks to trim down their credit exposure and perhaps dispose of non-performing loans. These are positions that we can then take our time to monetize and generate healthy returns for our investors out of. Returns on average on the Italian NPLs we have have been generating mid-teens net returns with an average portfolio hold of about two years. Q - This month, you announced a $130 million investment in India's affordable housing market. How aggressively will you add to that sector and which cities are you focusing on? A - Our investment vehicle will look to provide last-mile financing for real estate developers. Today, there is a real estate credit crunch in India. We are seeing many interesting developers who are stuck at the final stage of their real estate projects. We provide them with the financing to complete their project and start collecting income from the unit sales. The initial vehicle is $130 million in size. I hope we will build on this real soon. Q - You recently launched a $500 million Asia food sector fund. How is that doing and what sub-sectors do you see Investcorp using that capital to invest in? A - This is very exciting ... (it is) one of the largest and most resilient sectors in the Asia market. The fund will focus on condiments and the snacking sector, investing in local businesses throughout Asia for the purpose of support their expansion in the Chinese market. We do that through our fund partner, China Resources, the largest food distributor in China. We have just launched. Reception so far from investors has been strong. Over the coming months I hope that we will start to make some interesting investments. This interview was conducted in the  Global Markets

"Trump's parting gifts, the Piano Man, Greta meets a prince - Davos Wednesday highlights",Jan 23 2020,"() - The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) rolled on into Wednesday in the Swiss ski resort of Davos.  Here are the highlights from Day 2: A day after dismissing climate activists as “prophets of doom,” U.S. president Donald Trump said he would have loved to have seen Greta Thunberg speak at Davos. Their battle over climate change has dominated the first two days, with business leaders caught in the middle, concerned that as well as the words, there was a need for concrete decisions and action.  A confident Carrie Lam insisted she was staying on as the Chinese-ruled city's leader and dismissed calls to step down. At times laughing and smiling, Beijing-backed Lam said that she had to stay on to tackle an economic crisis and the coronavirus, which has killed 17 people in mainland China. Prince Charles shook hands with Thunberg after telling attendees it was time for everyone in a leadership role to take action “at revolutionary levels and pace” and listen to young people when it comes to climate change.  “Everything I have tried to do, and urge, over the past fifty years has been done with our children and grandchildren in mind, because I did not want to be accused by them of doing nothing except prevaricate and deny the problem,” said Charles, who met Thunberg after his speech. “Now of course, they are accusing us of exactly that.” For 25 years he had the ear of world leaders, CEOs and even rock stars at Davos, but the Swiss ski resort's most-listened to man has moved on. Barry Colson, a 56-year-old piano player who lives in Halifax, Canada, led a nightly songfest for WEF attendees as the musician-in-residence at the upstairs bar of the Hotel Europe. Now, he has opened up his own shop about 450 meters away. Calling a truce until the end of the year, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he had agreed with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that France would not require companies to pay its digital tax this year and that Mnuchin had agreed to suspend the tariff threat in the mean time. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy: The world cannot be united only in Facebook, when people re-post Greta Thunberg' speech, or photos of horrible fires in Australia, or photos of a downed, unfortunately, Ukrainian plane in Iran.

Greece expects tourism growth this year despite bumpy 2019: minister,Jan 23 2020,"ATHENS () - Tourism, which accounts for about a quarter of Greece's gross domestic product, will grow in 2020 despite the blow dealt to the sector last year by the collapse of British travel giant Thomas Cook, Tourism Minister Harry Theocharis said on Thursday.    Greece is emerging from a decade-long debt crisis and relying on its resorts, beaches and ancient monuments to attract strong visitor numbers if it is to fully recover. Tourism  employs roughly one in five people. Revenues in 2019 grew an estimated 12-15 % from about 16 billion euros in 2018 on the back of a 4% to 5% rise in arrivals, Theocharis told  in an interview. About 33 million tourists visited Greece in 2018, the year the country exited its third international bailout.  The collapse of Thomas Cook in September left thousands of holidaymakers stranded at island resorts and dealt a significant blow to Greek hoteliers and businesses. The impact was initially estimated at 500 million euros  ($555 million) and was seen spilling over to 2020, an immediate worry for the conservative government that took office in July.  But the sector has found new contracts and replaced the lost slots, Theocharis said, adding, “Despite the ups and downs, the surprises and the hurdles, 2019 rewarded us with a positive result”. “We are in a position to envision a new year with optimism that Thomas Cook has not left its mark,” he said. “We expect 2020 will be better than 2019.” Greece's target for 2020 and the years to come is an annual one-digit rise in arrivals and a two-digit increase in revenue, said Theocharis, who headed revenue collection at the country's finance ministry at the peak of the crisis in 2013-14.  The government has been mulling changes to the sector ranging from further regulating the homesharing market to opening up the industry to sea diving tourism, which is currently restricted because of the many archaeological ruins in Greek waters. The sector is still vulnerable to risks outside the government's control such as a recession in Europe or turmoil in the Middle East, Theocharis said. Climate change is a long-term challenge, he said, and Greece is studying its estimated impact. “Greece has a strong brand and can win a big share of the market as long as economic and other conditions allow it.”  ","{'neg': 0.098, 'neu': 0.81, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': -0.5859}",-0.5859
Pakistan defends Chinese investment after U.S. official's criticism,Jan 23 2020,"ISLAMABAD () - Pakistan on Thursday rejected criticism of the $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), after a visiting U.S. official was quoted expressing apprehension over the plan.  While Pakistan has continuously defended Chinese investment, it has also attempted to mend relations with the United States. Prime Minister Imran Khan and U.S. President Donald Trump have held at least three one-on-one meetings over the last six months, the latest on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday. U.S. officials have repeatedly criticized CPEC, under which Beijing has pledged about $60 billion for infrastructure in Pakistan, central to China's wider Belt and Road initiative to develop land and sea trade routes in Asia and beyond. Washington says the project is not sufficiently transparent and will saddle Pakistan with the burden of expensive Chinese loans. Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported that Alice Wells, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, had made similar remarks at a closed-door think tank event in Pakistan on Tuesday. Asked about the U.S. official's comments, Pakistan's foreign office spokeswoman, Aisha Farooqui, said CPEC was a transformational project for Pakistan, and completing it was the  government's highest priority. “To claim that CPEC is always in the form of loans and other forms of financing often non-concessional with sovereign guarantees is not based on facts,” Farooqui said during her weekly briefing. Before coming to power, Khan had also questioned the transparency of CPEC projects and expressed concern over Pakistan's rising debt burden. Since winning the 2018 election, he has tended to avoid such remarks, although some ministers in his cabinet have spoken of the need to renegotiate some deals. The Chinese Embassy in Islamabad, in a statement on Wednesday, said: “The U.S. is obsessed with the story it [has] made for CPEC.”  “If the U.S. truly cares about the development and prosperity of Pakistan and this region, it should bring cash and funds, promote win-win cooperation on the basis of mutual respect, fairness and justice, rather than act as a world policeman, spreading rumors and provoking China-Pakistan relations.” ","{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.865, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': -0.25}",-0.25
From Communist-era roots to cash cows: Poland's gaming industry takes on the world,Jan 23 2020,"WARSAW/PRAGUE () - The drab exteriors of a pair of 1970s buildings in an industrial Warsaw neighborhood belie the hive of high-tech activity inside where developers, screenplay writers and others at leading video game maker CD Projekt hustle to create the next global hit.  Poland — Eastern Europe's biggest economy — has quietly developed into a leading video game exporter thanks to low labor costs, a young educated workforce and a thriving gaming tradition rooted in the Communist era. After CD Projekt's top-selling Witcher series put the country on the map, foreign investors are keenly searching for promising game developers in a fast-growing market. “People are starting to take notice of Poland,” said Borys Musielak, founding partner at U.S.-Polish venture capital firm SMOK Ventures, which is in talks with two Asian investors to fund local gaming companies and in January made its first such investment alongside a Finnish partner. “There have been mainly angel investors and some private equity but now global venture capital groups are looking into the region.” Poland's booming video game and esports market was worth $664 million in 2019 — up from $400 million in 2014 — and is projected to climb to nearly $850 million over the next four years, according to data from PwC. The success of CD Projekt's medieval fantasy world Witcher has been a key driver. Based on a series of best-selling Polish books and the basis for a Netflix show that premiered in December, the games have sold more than 40 million copies worldwide. The release later this year of the company's first person futuristic adventure game “Cyberpunk 2077” is likely to sharpen focus on a sector in which eight companies listed on the main market of the Polish stock exchange between 2015 and 2019. On the NewConnect market — the bourse's exchange for smaller companies — 21 debuted during the same period. “Historically, a lot of those companies chose the stock exchange to finance themselves because there were not many ways to raise capital,” said Mariusz Gasiewski, head of mobile gaming and apps at Google in Poland. “Now it is getting easier as more interest comes from abroad.” The combined value of the listed gaming companies leapt 82% to more than 32 billion zlotys ($8.36 billion) last year, led by CD Projekt, 11 bit studios, PlayWay and Ten Square Games, according to exchange data. Moreover, CD Projekt's roughly 27 billion zloty valuation is rapidly catching up with that of Poland's biggest company, refiner PKN Orlen, at 36 billion zlotys.   KNOW-HOW At CD Projekt — whose headquarters feature Silicon Valley perks such as a gym, film studio and open plan offices — the company has parlayed Poles' love of video games into a global brand. “We have been working intensively on increasing the knowledge of CD Projekt among foreign investors,” the company's  president and one of its founders Adam Kicinski told . “We are meeting with funds from around the world focusing on western markets, especially in the United States.” Bigger funding rounds and the tapping of international investors will help Polish companies compete with industry leaders from countries such as China, Japan and the U.S.. “Due to their know-how and appropriate budgets, foreign investors help those companies go from the stage where they create very good games to the absolute top,” said Stanislaw Just, a former board member of the Polish Games Association who recently started his own company. Flying Wild Hog, a smaller developer known for the Shadow Warrior series, was acquired by London-based Supernova Capital in 2019, while Artificer, which is working on its debut game, was bought by Dutch-based Good Shepherd Entertainment. Poland's love of video games stems from the Communist era when students flocked to street markets to swap pirated games, building up a flourishing community. “For the previous generation, Rock & Roll was a ticket to the world we all dreamed of, then came the games and we all played to touch what was happening in the West,” said Grzegorz Miechowski, president of 11 bit studios, whose most popular title “Frostpunk” depicts a dystopian 19th Century England.  Nearly half of Poland's 38 million population identify as gamers, while there are around 400 active gaming companies — dwarfing an estimated dozen in Germany — with some 100 Polish titles hitting the global market each year. The country hosts a popular international video game festival as well as one of the largest esports events in the world - the Intel Extreme Masters, which last year drew a record 232 million viewers worldwide. Miechowski also pointed to Poland's education system which  churns out computer science savvy graduates eager to work in game development.  The government has taken notice too, doling out around 300 million zlotys through a European Union funded program — the fourth round of which is underway — to award developers early stage grants to help gaming projects get off the ground.

TEXT-ECB statement after policy meeting,Jan 23 2020,"Jan 23 () - Following is the text of European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde's statement after the bank's policy meeting on Thursday: Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. We will continue to make net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) at a monthly pace of 20 billion euros. We expect them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates. We also intend to continue re-investing, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Today the Governing Council also decided to launch a review of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. Further details about the scope and timetable of the review will be published in a press release today at 15:30 CET. The incoming data since our last meeting are in line with our baseline scenario of ongoing, but moderate, growth of the euro area economy. In particular, the weakness in the manufacturing sector remains a drag on euro area growth momentum. However, ongoing, albeit decelerating, employment growth and increasing wages continue to support the resilience of the euro area economy. While inflation developments remain subdued overall, there are some signs of a moderate increase in underlying inflation in line with expectations. The unfolding monetary policy measures are underpinning favourable financing conditions for all sectors of the economy. In particular, easier borrowing conditions for firms and households are supporting consumer spending and business investment. This will sustain the euro area expansion, the build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, the robust convergence of inflation to our medium-term aim. At the same time, in the light of the continued subdued inflation outlook, monetary policy has to remain highly accommodative for a prolonged period of time to support underlying inflation pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. We will, therefore, closely monitor inflation developments and the impact of the unfolding monetary policy measures on the economy. Our forward guidance will ensure that financial conditions adjust in accordance with changes to the inflation outlook. In any case, the Governing Council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2019, following growth of 0.2% in the second quarter. This pattern of moderate growth reflects the ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of continued global uncertainties, which has particularly affected the euro area manufacturing sector and has also dampened investment growth. At the same time, the services and construction sectors remain more resilient, despite some moderation in the latter half of 2019. Incoming economic data and survey information point to some stabilisation in euro area growth dynamics, with near-term growth expected to be similar to rates observed in previous quarters. Looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains in conjunction with rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing – albeit somewhat slower – growth in global activity. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook, related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, remain tilted to the downside, but have become less pronounced as some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade is receding. Euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 1.3% in December 2019, from 1.0% in November, reflecting mainly higher energy price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to hover around current levels in the coming months. While indicators of inflation expectations remain at low levels, recently they have either stabilised or ticked up slightly. Measures of underlying inflation have remained generally muted, although there are further indications of a moderate increase in line with previous expectations. While labour cost pressures have strengthened amid tighter labour markets, the weaker growth momentum is delaying their pass-through to inflation. Over the medium term, inflation is expected to increase, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and solid wage growth. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth stood at 5.6% in November 2019, broadly unchanged since August. Sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3 relative to other financial instruments. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side. The growth of loans to firms and households remained solid, benefiting from the ongoing support provided by our accommodative monetary policy stance, which is reflected in very low bank lending rates. While the annual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged from October, at 3.5% in November, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations moderated to 3.4% in November, from 3.8% in October, likely reflecting some lagged reaction to the past weakening in the economy. These developments are also visible in the results of the euro area bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2019, which indicate weakening demand for loans to firms, while demand for loans to households for house purchase continued to increase. However, credit standards for both loans to firms and loans to households for house purchase remained broadly unchanged, pointing to still favourable credit supply conditions. Overall, our accommodative monetary policy stance will help to safeguard very favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing across all economic sectors and in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential, supporting aggregate demand at the current juncture and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural policies in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to boost euro area productivity and growth potential, reduce structural unemployment and increase resilience. The 2019 country-specific recommendations should serve as the relevant signpost. Regarding fiscal policies, the euro area fiscal stance is expected to continue to provide some support to economic activity. In view of the weak economic outlook, the Governing Council welcomes the Eurogroup's call in December for differentiated fiscal responses and its readiness to coordinate. Governments with fiscal space should be ready to act in an effective and timely manner. In countries where public debt is high, governments need to pursue prudent policies and meet structural balance targets, which will create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely. All countries should intensify their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the European Union's fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union.

Brexit brings jobs boost - for Germany,Jan 23 2020,"BERLIN () - About two dozen British firms told German authorities in 2019 they plan to open offices in Germany and will create 680 new jobs, more than in the previous two years combined, the government's business marketing arm said on Thursday. Germany Trade and Invest (GTAI) linked the increase to Britain's departure from the European Union on January 31, and said the number of planned new jobs may rise as some firms registered plans directly with Germany's 16 federal states. “We are witnessing a constant increase in the activity of British companies in Germany,” said GTAI chief Robert Hermann.  Some companies were moving to Germany to skirt tariffs that could be imposed on British goods and services once Britain leaves the EU while others were attracted by favorable conditions, Hermann added. About a third were finance and business services companies, just under a third specialized in IT and some 40% were a mix that included engineering and consumer specialists. Britain's parliament has approved a divorce settlement with the EU, which includes a business-as-usual transition deal covering the period after Brexit Day on Jan. 31 until the end of December. Hermann said British business leaders appear undeterred by Germany's weakening economy, whose export-oriented manufacturing sector is in recession. Germany is Britain's second-biggest export market after the United States. ","{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.885, 'pos': 0.086, 'compound': 0.9022}",0.9022
World financial intelligence group re-admits Vatican after suspension,Jan 23 2020,"VATICAN CITY () - The Vatican has been fully re-admitted to the Egmont Group of world financial intelligence units after a suspension two months ago sparked by an investigation into the purchase of luxury London real estate. Carmelo Barbagallo, president of the Vatican's Financial Information Authority (AIF), said on Thursday the AIF would “resume its collaboration with foreign financial intelligence units in full transparency and in the spirit of active cooperation”. The Egmont Group's president, Mariano Federici, had notified the AIF that it had been re-admitted to the use of Egmont's secure communications network, Barbagallo said in a statement.  Egmont is a Toronto-based informal organization with about 165 members. Its secure network allows members to share information about crimes such as money laundering, tax fraud and terrorism financing. Egmont's acceptance of the Vatican six years ago was seen as a major step forward in cleaning up the Vatican's negative image following years of scandals, particularly involving its bank.  The suspension on Nov. 13 was a major setback for the Vatican, which risked again being seen as a pariah by the international financial community. On Oct. 1, Vatican police entered the offices of the AIF and of the Secretariat of State - the administrative heart of the Catholic Church - as part of their investigation of an investment the Secretariat had made in London real estate. The officers, operating under a search warrant secured by the Vatican's own prosecutor, seized documents, computers and cellphones during the raids. The raid prompted concerns in the international financial community about the AIF's ability to keep confidential documents secure and led to the suspension from Egmont. The suspension was lifted after the signing of a memorandum of understanding with Vatican prosecutors, the AIF statement said. Barbagallo, 63, a respected senior Bank of Italy official, was appointed by Pope Francis in November to succeed Swiss lawyer and anti-money laundering expert Rene Bruelhart. Bruelhart had headed the AIF for five years and the pope decided not to renew his mandate. Five Vatican employees were suspended after the Oct. 1 raids, including AIF director Tommaso di Ruzza. Domenico Giani, Vatican security chief and the pope's bodyguard, resigned later over the leak of a document related to the investigation.

"Italy readies pension reform, may end early retirement scheme ahead of schedule",Jan 23 2020,"ROME () - Italy is preparing to reform its pension system again to make it more flexible for those who want to leave work early, officials say, and the changes may include ending ahead of time a costly but underused 2018 plan that lowered the minimum retirement age. With a steadily growing army of retirees, pensions in Italy are a national obsession and one of the most frequently debated topics on television talk shows. Under the 2018 “quota 100” plan, people can draw a pension if they have paid in 38 years of contributions as long as they are 62 years old - the sum of the two figures giving the “100” of the plan's name. The plan was budgeted to cost almost 20 billion euros ($22.2 billion) over three years until 2021, when it is due to expire. But some in the government are pushing to drop it at the end of this year to save money. With one of the world's oldest populations, Italy spends more than 16% of national output on pensions, more than any other developed country except Greece, data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development shows.  This makes it harder for Rome to reduce its debt, which is the second highest in the European Union and drains resources from other areas. For example, Italy is near the bottom of the OECD's 35-nation league table for education spending. “Instead of waiting for the natural end of quota 100 at the end of 2021, it would be better to have a replacement solution ready to come into force next January,” Treasury undersecretary Pier Paolo Baretta of the ruling Democratic Party told . As things stand, when quota 100 expires, retirement rules are set to automatically revert to those imposed in a highly unpopular 2011 reform that raised the retirement age to 67. The government wants to avoid this by introducing a new system that is less generous than quota 100 but less severe than the 2011 regime, imposed by former premier Mario Monti at the height of the euro zone debt crisis. One option being considered is to let people retire at 64 but on a reduced pension compared with what they would get if they stayed at work a few years longer, said a government source who asked not to be named. “Pension reform is one of our top priorities,” said Labour Minister Nunzia Catalfo of the co-ruling 5-Star Movement. “We will try to find a way to help workers retire earlier, especially those with physically tough jobs,” she told . The new reform will be the sixth significant overhaul in recent decades. Three of the previous ones raised the retirement age, while two of them, including quota 100, reduced it. Ending quota 100 a year early would yield significant savings, but the new system will be more expensive than going back to the 2011 reform. The quota 100 option has proved less popular than expected, which has helped public finances. Pasquale Tridico, head of the state pensions agency INPS, told  he estimated savings of 2.6 billion euros in 2020 and at least 2 billion in 2021. Most of this money has already been earmarked for other spending measures in the budget passed by parliament last month, a Treasury official said. Successive governments have tinkered with the system ever since the mid-1990s, when a hugely generous pension regime still allowed millions of people to retire in their 40s and 50s under what were known as “baby pensions.” Those are a thing of the past, but Italian pensioners have still fared better than workers during two decades of economic stagnation. Average pensions grew twice as much as wages between 2000 and 2015, data from national statistics bureau ISTAT shows. ","{'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.859, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': 0.9834}",0.9834
India likely to fund some $28 billion of 2020/21 expenditure via off-budget borrowings: sources,Jan 23 2020,"NEW DELHI () - India is likely to fund roughly $28 billion of its expenditure outlay in its budget for fiscal 2020/21 via off-budget borrowings, three government sources said, as it seeks to revive a sagging economy while keeping its fiscal deficit in check. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is under pressure to increase spending on rural welfare schemes and infrastructure to boost growth that has fallen for six straight quarters.  Off-budget borrowings are a means by which the government keeps its fiscal deficit in check by making quasi-government entities borrow on its behalf, to partly fund its expenditure plan for the year. This would mark a roughly 13.8% increase in so-called off-budget borrowings from an estimated 1.75 trillion rupees ($24.6 billion) in the ongoing fiscal year, said the three sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter and asked not to be identified as the discussions are private.  “We're facing a serious economic crisis,” said one of the sources, adding there was no alternative but to raise spending on infrastructure and welfare schemes to boost consumer demand and create jobs. “You should not be surprised if the real deficit touches 4.5% of GDP,” he said, adding the “official” deficit could be kept between 3.5% and 4% of GDP.  He said the government had realized it needed to take all possible steps to support growth “after initial denial of the economic slowdown”.  A spokesman for the finance ministry declined to comment, citing the silent period ahead of the budget speech on Feb. 1. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) this month cut India's growth forecast to 4.8% for the ongoing fiscal year - its lowest level in 11 years. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who will deliver the budget speech, is widely expected to announce stimulus measures for small businesses and non-banking finance companies as a cut in corporate tax rates and rate cuts by the central bank have failed to revive growth. The fiscal deficit for the current fiscal year was likely to touch 3.7% or 3.8% of GDP after the slowdown dented revenue collections, the second government official said.  In the 2020/21 budget, Sitharaman could announce plans to spend over 105 trillion rupees ($1.48 trillion) on infrastructure in the next five years and expand annual spending on railways, roads, renewable energy, water and health sector by up to 20%, said the first official.    “Inflation is not an issue for now,” he said, adding that India needed 5-6% inflation to improve agricultural and corporate earnings.  The government could increase the target of raising revenue through privatization of state companies to 1.5 trillion rupees for next fiscal year, the second official said.  India's committed spending, excluding capital spending, could be targeted at near 27 trillion rupees ($379.91 billion) for the next fiscal year, compared to the budgeted 24.5 trillion rupees in the current fiscal year, while about 4 trillion rupees could be allocated to capital spending, the first official said.  Modi's party has also urged him to announce steps to revive real estate and other sectors. “We are no more in a denial mode,” Gopal Krishan Agarwal, the head of BJP's Economic Affairs Cell, told . “You will see measures in the budget to boost investments and growth.” ","{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.826, 'pos': 0.101, 'compound': 0.9477}",0.9477
Zimbabwe says grain stocks running out after drought,Jan 23 2020,"HARARE, Jan 23 () - Zimbabwe has only 100,000 tonnes of grain in its strategic reserves, enough to last just over a month, as the southern African nation suffers the effects of a severe drought, according to the agriculture minister. More than half the country's population faces food shortages after maize harvests halved last year. The country has received little rain since the summer planting season started in November, and crops are wilting in some areas. Agriculture minister Perrance Shiri told officials in Bulawayo, southwest Zimbabwe, on Wednesday that the government should help farmers cope with drought by building more irrigation infrastructure. “As things stand at the current moment, we have less than 100,000 (metric tonnes) of grain in the strategic grain reserve and imports, especially of food, are ballooning,” he said in a speech seen by . The grain reserve has capacity to hold 500,000 tonnes but it has been run down after a poor harvest. Zimbabwe consumes 80,000 tonnes of maize every month. Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube has said Zimbabwe needs to import at least 800,000 tonnes of maize this year, mainly from Tanzania, South Africa and South America. The country's grain millers group says it has bought 100,000 tonnes of maize from South Africa and Brazil and expects the first consignment to arrive next week. Shops are running out of subsidised maize meal while prices of basic goods soar. Zimbabwe is in the midst of its worst economic crisis in a decade, dashing hopes for a quick recovery under President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government. The United Nations World Food Programme needs $200 million to feed 4.1 million Zimbabweans after saying the country faced another poor harvest this year because of sparse rains.

Mexico goes ghost as its oil hedge bill spirals,Jan 23 2020,"MEXICO CITY/NEW YORK () - Mexico is playing a risky game of hide and seek with the oil market. To frustrate speculators and contain an annual bill of more than $1 billion, Mexico is going to new lengths to mask its attempts to insure its revenue from oil sales against falling prices - no mean feat for a hedging program known as Wall Street's biggest oil trade.  Getting the hedge right is crucial for Mexico as it offers stability at a time the government is planning to boost social welfare and security spending, the economy is stagnating and the country's credit-worthiness is under intense scrutiny. Once an enigmatic agreement between a handful of finance industry officials and Wall Street banks, the hedge is now the most anticipated deal in the oil futures market, making it harder, and more costly, for Mexico to arrange. For its 2020 hedge, however, Mexico has adopted a different strategy than in previous years, according to a Wall Street source with direct knowledge of the deal. This time, an estimated two-thirds of the options Mexico bought in financial markets were indexed to the international Brent crude benchmark, shifting away from the Maya oil Mexico mainly produces, according to the source. By using such a heavily traded contract as Brent, Mexico should have been able to cut costs by getting lower quotes for its trades and to place bets more unobtrusively to avoid prices shifting ahead of its moves, market sources said.     But critics say the strategy creates new risks. By using international oil contracts based on a different kind of oil, the structure of the hedge may not fully reflect Mexico's export mix dominated by Maya, which is typically cheaper than Brent. “I would expect a divergence of prices over the long term. This pressure on Maya could move prices down faster than its hedge. This would cause a loss on the physical sale of Maya and minimal-to-possibly no benefit of the hedge,” said Ryan Dusek, director at consulting firm Opportune LLP https://opportune.com based in Houston, who added that the trade could end up being “worthless.” The Mexican finance ministry declined to comment on the structure of the hedge. The Wall Street source said the proportion of Maya crude hedged for 2020 was significantly lower than in previous years.  For the 2009 deal, for example, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley hedged 305 million barrels of crude using Maya and only 25 million with Brent, data obtained by  through a freedom of information request showed. The Wall Street source said for 2020, Mexico had bought put options on Brent on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) at $54-$56 a barrel and hedged Maya at $42.  Brent LCOc1 is trading at around $63 a barrel while Maya's official selling price for deliveries to the U.S. Gulf Coast is about $55, according to S&P Global Platts pricing data. The options give Mexico the right to sell oil at the predetermined price, so if the actual market price is lower, the options pay out and make up the difference - acting effectively as an insurance policy. But if the price of Maya, a heavy sour crude, falls faster than Brent, a light sweet crude - or Maya drops and Brent rises - Mexico could miss out on oil revenues without the hedge kicking in, analysts and market sources said. Mexico has had to contend with the potential divergence in Maya and Brent crude prices before but the risk is now greater as demand for heavy crudes globally is expected to slump.  was unable to determine whether Mexico has taken additional steps to bridge any gaps between Maya and Brent. Mere rumors of Mexico's “Hacienda hedge,” which gets its name from the country's finance ministry, can shift prices ahead of its anticipated deals and the government fears participants push up premiums when they suspect Mexico is about to trade. “Banks have become much better at accumulating information about it,” said Victor Gomez, a former Mexican finance ministry official involved in the hedge until 2018. In part due to this, the hedge's cost has increased 10-fold in peso terms since 2001, even though the number of barrels hedged has barely changed, the data obtained from the freedom of information request showed. Mexico spent the equivalent of $212 million to hedge 200 million barrels in 2001 but in 2016, hedging 212 million barrels cost $956 million. In 2017, Mexico stopped disclosing the number of barrels it has hedged.  Now, for the first time in at least 19 years, finance ministry officials have declined to reveal how much they're spending to protect 2020 revenue, saying the information would give speculators insight into their strategy and raise costs. “What we don't want is that they identify the moments that Mexico goes to the market, because that raises the costs of the premium,” Gabriel Yorio, one of the main architects of the hedge under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office a year ago, told reporters this month. The cost of the hedge has also risen because the peso has declined versus the U.S. dollar and because options have become more expensive since many commodity-oriented funds, which were natural counterparties to the deal, have closed. Officials have also declined to say how much of the 1.73 million barrels a day it produces they're protecting, nor to what extent they're using put options or a budget stabilization fund to guarantee government revenue. All they have disclosed is that the 2020 hedge guarantees an average price for Maya of $49 a barrel. (Graphic: Mexico oil hedge - ) Since 2001, Mexico has received three payouts up until the end of last year: in 2009, 2015 and 2016, the data showed. Nevertheless, those three payments were so large the finance ministry could argue it was still ahead - at least before including the cost of the 2020 program. Mexico has also taken other steps to cover its tracks. In response to further questions in ' records request, Mexico's transparency institute said additional information about the hedge had been sealed for five years. It cited the finance ministry as saying revealing details could increase costs, affect Mexico's monetary policy and financial stability and create systemic financial risk. “This is part of Mexico's strategy to leave banks and oil majors in the dark about what they are buying and how much they are paying,” said Gomez. Asked about specifics at a news conference on Jan. 9, Mexican official Yorio highlighted the importance of the overhaul of the crude oil pricing formulas that underpin Mexico's oil exports. Last year, Mexico changed the pricing formula for Maya sales to the U.S. Gulf Coast to be based 65% on U.S. West Texas Intermediate in Houston - a light sweet crude which is the most traded U.S. Gulf Coast grade - and 35% on Brent futures. Before, it had been derived from West Texas Sour, Dated Brent and other grades that have become less traded markets. The formula also previously included fuel oil rich in sulphur, which has been hit by new rules requiring ships to use cleaner fuel. Mexican officials involved in the hedge in the past said the government may be considering increasing its use of the stabilization fund to guarantee oil prices as a supplement to financial instruments. From the mid-2010s, Mexico started to lock in part of its target oil price with the fund to contain the costs of the options it buys from banks and major oil companies. For example, Mexico locked in a price of $79 for its 2015 hedge, with $76.40 guaranteed by options and the remaining $2.60 backed by the fund. In 2017, the last time the ministry released such information, $4 of its $42 hedge was covered by the fund.  Gomez and Julio Ruiz, another former official involved in the hedge until 2018, said Mexico was expected to expand this strategy in the coming years but cautioned it would struggle to keep enough money in the fund to hedge oil exports fully.  “They would have to accumulate a larger amount of resources in this fund,” Gomez said. Nevertheless, those changes would do little to ease the concerns of some who believe Mexico spends too much on the hedge, said Ruiz, adding that guaranteeing oil revenue was still necessary given the pressures on Mexico and state-owned Pemex, the world's most heavily indebted oil company. “In congress, many will say they don't agree with how this money is spent, and that it shouldn't be spent on the oil hedging program,” Ruiz said.  “But Mexico's finances would become a lot more volatile without it.” ","{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.894, 'pos': 0.049, 'compound': -0.7044}",-0.7044
Thailand plans new tax incentives to boost investment,Jan 23 2020,"BANGKOK () - Thailand's finance ministry will submit to the cabinet on Tuesday a package of tax incentives to encourage investment, a deputy prime minister said on Thursday, as the government looks to revive a flagging economy. The Thai economy has lagged most of its peers for years, with exports weak and investment sluggish. The government estimated growth of 2.6% in 2019, a five-year low. The finance ministry has been asked to consider more generous tax incentives to attract domestic and foreign investment this year, Somkid Jatusripitak told reporters.     “Currently, we offer a tax deduction of 1.5 times on investment. But the new package will offer more, plus many other measures, Somkid said. “This will definitely increase investment even more”. Finance Minister Uttama Savanayana told reporters that the ministry planned to offer a tax deduction of 2.5 times on investment, and there would be tax exemptions on imports of machinery. Both measures, to be introduced during January-December, are expected to draw investment of more than 100 billion baht ($3.29 billion), he added. “It's the first time that we will offer this high 2.5 times (tax deduction),” he said. “Both measures will cost the government about 9 billion in lost revenue. But it's worth it”. Uttama said the government would also offer soft loans for businesses. Somkid said the Board of Investment was also planning additional measures to support investment. Last year, Thailand offered a relocation package to draw foreign companies seeking to move production because of Sino-U.S. trade tensions. Somkid said the government would also accelerate large transport projects, the auction of 5G spectrum and offer  investment by state companies to help improve business activity. On trade, the government is working on membership in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), Somkid said. A fund will be provided to help business that may be affected by the deal, he said. Membership could be a boon for Thailand as competition heats up in electronics, seafood and agriculture from rival export and manufacturing economies, such as Malaysia and Vietnam.

Breakingviews - Italian banks will yield to M&A imperative,Jan 23 2020,"MILAN ( Breakingviews) - Italian banks are facing a renewed urge to merge. A decade after the euro zone crisis erupted, the country's lenders have shed most of their bad loans, while doubling their capital ratios. The problem now is that they can't earn decent returns. Ultra-low interest rates and attempts to limit their holdings of government bonds make the need to join forces with rivals all the more pressing. For years Italy's bad loans were the main headache for European regulators. Now the pain is easing. A flurry of disposals has allowed Italian banks to halve the overall stock of gross bad credit on their balance sheets to 177 billion euros by June last year, from 360 billion euros at the peak of the crisis in 2015. Many large transactions, including UniCredit's mammoth 18 billion euro FINO or “Failure is Not an Option” sale and Banco BPM's 5 billion euro “Exodus”, had dramatic names that stressed bankers' awareness of the urgency of the situation. After deducting provisions, net bad loans stood at 30 billion euros in November last year, or 1.7% of total loans. Meanwhile, Italian banks have boosted their capital buffers. The average common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.6% of total risk-weighted assets at the end of September, twice the level before the global financial crisis erupted in 2007. The cleanup effort has successfully reduced financial risk, but at a cost. Many Italian banks were forced to take big writedowns when they sold their sour credits, or increase provisions against future losses. The industry has collectively generated an annual return on equity of just 0.8% since 2007, according to Italy's banking association ABI. Profitability has picked up since: the average ROE at the end of September was 8%, according to the European Central Bank. However, that's still below the industry's cost of capital, which senior Italian bankers estimate at more than 10%. That is one reason why listed Italian banks trade on average at half their book value. There's little prospect of improvement. While grappling with Italy's stagnating economy, domestic banks also face an extended period of negative official interest rates. Meanwhile, regulators seem inclined to keep raising capital requirements.  And banks have new problems. Italian lenders hold about 400 billion euros of government debt. At 10% of combined assets, this is one of the highest proportions in Europe – and more than twice the level before the financial crisis. That reinforces the “doom loop” which ties troubled banks to their cash-strapped governments. To discourage such high concentration, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz in November suggested stripping state debt of its risk-free status. Other ideas proposed by policymakers and academics include putting a cap on the amount of their own government's debt that banks can hold. Buying relatively high-yielding Italian sovereign bonds has been a cheap way for banks to boost their interest income. But if capital charges or curbs come into place, that will dry up. Faced with uncertainty over their future earnings, Italian bank executives have all the more reason to consolidate. Italy has 490 different credit institutions, roughly one for every 123,000 inhabitants, twice as many as Spain. The action is likely to focus on domestic combinations, where overlaps can generate greater savings. Mid-sized players like Giuseppe Castagna's Banco BPM and Victor Massiah's UBI Banca might start the merger dance. Asset managers like Banca Generali or Azimut could also become targets. Mediobanca, which has some spare cash and is building up its wealth management business, is already on the prowl. Successful mergers face hurdles, though. Regulators are likely to demand that any merged bank completely writes down any lingering dud loans. That may require lenders to raise capital and delay any near-term promise of increased dividends. Also, rigid Italian labour laws may limit banks' ability to reduce staff. If they delay, however, bank CEOs may have to present investors with the unappealing prospect of gradually eroding profitability. They would also miss the opportunity to take advantage of a scheme the government is offering to fund early retirement. Troubled lender Banca Carige has already used it as part of its wide-ranging restructuring. Meanwhile, the threat of regulators slapping Italian lenders with higher capital charges if they continue to hold too much state debt cannot be dismissed. Despite some recent high-profile tie-ups, such as the creation of Banco BPM, or Intesa Sanpaolo's purchase of two troubled Veneto-based lenders in 2017,  Italian banks still have plenty of scope to consolidate.

United States cautions Britain over Huawei,Jan 23 2020,"DAVOS/LONDON () - The United States cautioned Britain ahead of a decision by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on what role Huawei will have in 5G telecommunications networks that Washington still had significant concerns about the Chinese telecoms behemoth. In the first big test of Brexit Britain's foreign policy, Johnson has so far resisted intense pressure from President Donald Trump's administration to block Huawei, which the United States fears could compromise British secrets. Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment, denies it is a vehicle for Chinese intelligence and says the United States wants to ban it because no U.S. company can offer the same range of 5G technology at a competitive price. After a public disagreement between U.S. and British ministers in Davos over taxes on digital services, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that he would be meeting with British finance minister on Saturday on Huawei. “Let me just say again, it's a complicated issue,” Mnuchin said. “We've made very clear that it relates to all of the critical areas that we have significant concerns. But again, there's ongoing discussion on these issues.” Britain is expected to make a final call on how to deploy Huawei equipment in its 5G networks later this month. In what some have compared to the Cold War arms race, the United States is worried that 5G dominance would give any global competitor such as China an advantage Washington is not ready to accept. That puts Johnson on the spot with the United Kingdom's closest security ally just as he seeks to negotiate post-Brexit trade deals with both the European Union and the United States - and juggle conflicting EU and U.S. policy on Iran.  Britain wants a trade deal with the United States but will still impose a digital service tax on the revenue of companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, business minister Andrea Leadsom said on Thursday. Leadsom said that Britain will soon decide what role Huawei will have but there are only a limited number of alternative providers, business minister Andrea Leadsom said on Thursday. “Well there are other providers but they are limited, ideally there would be more providers of infrastructure similar to the work that Huawei does but the UK is looking very carefully at this issue and we will be making a final decision soon,” Leadsom told Sky.     “It is an ongoing process and there are all sorts of factors to take into consideration, as you say, like the availability of other providers, like the work that Huawei has already done in the United Kingdom, so these discussions are ongoing,” she said. “I share the concerns of many citizens about protecting our national security interest,” Leadsom said.

Sberbank CEO could resign if shareholder change modifies strategy: RIA,Jan 23 2020,"MOSCOW () - German Gref, the chief executive of Russia's Sberbank (), could leave his post if a possible shareholder change at the bank results in a switch in its strategy, the RIA news agency quoted him as saying on Thursday. The Russian government has been in talks with the central bank to buy the latter's 50% plus one share stake in Sberbank, the country's largest lender. “When I came to this position, I came with a certain approach,” said Gref, who has served as the bank's CEO since 2007.  “If this approach changes, I don't see my place in the company.” Gref said he hoped a shareholder change would not modify the bank's strategy. “We strongly believe that the strategy is the right one,” he was quoted as saying. “We have had interesting discussions with the government regarding the use of our platform for digital services. We are very interested (in this), I hope we will move in that direction,” Gref added.  Management of Sberbank remains on track to recommend a dividend payment of 50% of net income for 2019, but the payment will be subject to final approval by board of directors and shareholders, Gref said. Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev said on Wednesday that the mechanism behind the central bank's potential exit from Sberbank's shareholder structure was being discussed and that a final decision had yet to be made.  If the government did in fact take over the central bank's shares, Sberbank would come under the control of Russia's federal government property agency, he said. Despite his concern about a switch in strategy, Gref told state television on Thursday he was more optimistic about the prospect of a change in shareholder. “I would say that I feel more positively than negatively about this,” he said, speaking from the World Economic Forum in Davos.

BP appoints new finance chief as Looney prepares to take over,Jan 23 2020,"LONDON () - BP's () finance chief Brian Gilvary is to step down in June after eight years in the role and will be replaced by a close ally of Bernard Looney who takes over as chief executive next month. Murray Auchincloss, currently finance head of BP's upstream division, will become BP's chief financial officer on July 1, the company said on Tuesday. Gilvary has been credited with overseeing BP's financial recovery following the 2010 deadly Gulf of Mexico oil spill which has cost the company more than $65 billion in fines, indemnities and clean up costs. The London-based company saw its profits recover sharply in recent years, allowing it to remove the scrip dividend last year, an austerity measure on shareholder payouts.  However, in October, Gilvary appeared to backtrack on a previous hint that the company would boost its dividend payouts, angering investors. His departure comes earlier than anticipated and as Looney, who will replace Bob Dudley as chief executive of BP after a decade, faces the tricky task of navigating the energy major through a rising tide of environmentalism and the move to a low-carbon economy. “Gilvary's departure may be associated with a more significant change in the company's strategy including its financial strategy as the running of BP moves to a new top team,” stockbroker Panmure Gordon said in a note. Panmure Gordon said Gilvary's departure may also be associated with “problematic guidance over dividend”, a view which BP later rejected as “not true”. Gilvary, an avid triathlete who joined BP in 1986, will step down from the board on June 30. He is a non-executive director at Air Liquide (), the Royal Navy Board and the Francis Crick Institute. (GRAPHIC: BP's recovery - ) In his current role Auchincloss worked with Looney, who until being appointed CEO was head of BP's oil and gas production division, known as upstream. Auchincloss oversaw a broad cost-cutting drive across the division in the wake of the 2014 oil price crash.      “I have worked side-by-side with Murray for many years and have the utmost confidence in his ability to step into this critical role,” Looney said in a statement.

Exclusive: Trafigura to buy Angolan general's stake in Puma Energy - sources,Jan 23 2020,"LONDON () - Global commodities trader Trafigura is in advanced talks to buy more than 10% of an Angolan general's stake in its fuel retail arm Puma Energy by the end of the year, sources familiar with the matter said.  Retired general Leopoldino Fragoso do Nascimento, known as General Dino, holds a 15% stake in Puma via his company Cochan Holdings. Trafigura holds 49% and Angola's state firm Sonangol 28%. Puma's shareholding structure was put together under Trafigura's former CEO and founder Claude Dauphin, who was close to the former ruling Angolan elite.  However, the Swiss firm's hopes of listing Puma hit compliance hurdles owing to the general's presence as a significant stakeholder.  Trafigura has wanted to restructure Puma's ownership for years but the move to buy out Cochan only began in earnest after Emma Fitzgerald took over as Puma's chief executive in January last year.  Puma and Trafigura declined to comment. Cochan did not respond to a request for comment. The move comes as Angola itself is reviewing its assets. The government announced a cross-sector privatization drive last year, including its aim to list state oil firm Sonangol by 2022 and divest its stake in Puma. In a first step, Cochan agreed last year to no longer be represented on Puma's board.  A source familiar with the matter said this had already allowed Puma to widen its pool of banks.  Fitzgerald took the helm at difficult time for Puma, which has been loss-making since 2018.  After a McKinsey review, the firm has been selling off assets such as its business in Paraguay and more recently Australian assets which had become a drag on its finances.     One source said that Trafigura planned to reduce General Dino's stake to less than 5% with the aim of attracting more global banks and new equity investment. The deal will not be a pure cash exchange.  Trafigura will likely spend between $357 million and $535 million for the stake. In its 2019 annual report, Trafigura reduced the value of its stake in Puma by $200 million to $1.75 billion, valuing the company at $3.57 billion.  The trading firm has other business links with Cochan, namely a joint venture called DTS Holdings which is the main holding company of DT Group and which focuses on sub-Saharan and Angolan investments.  Puma, which traces its roots to Argentina, has around 3,000 retail fuel stations in Latin America, Africa and Asia-Pacific.  Rival Vitol Group listed its Africa-focused retail fuel unit Vivo Energy on the London Stock Exchange in 2018 that launched at about 2 billion pounds.

Too good to be true? The best investment that never was,Jan 23 2020,"LONDON (Thomson  Foundation) - Leading investors may well have been tempted by a startup prospectus offering a slice of a long-neglected sector that promises vast growth, low risks and healthy returns. The catch?  “Unfounded Ltd” was not a real startup, but a company invented to throw light on the sorry state of investment in female entrepreneurs and the barriers women face to win funding. The pitch was sent to 100 global venture capitalists by non-profit group H&M Foundation in an initiative launched on Thursday to encourage funders to back women in business. “Unfounded Ltd is a tool to break the barriers that women entrepreneurs face in access to finance,” said Diana Amini, global manager of the H&M Foundation, founded by the owners of the Swedish fashion chain. “By using the language of investors, we want to reach the individuals who make the judgment calls and write the cheques.” Women-owned companies perform better on average than those run by men, said the report, but often miss out on the money they need to grow.  Companies founded by women won 3% of venture capital funding in the United States last year, according to data cited by H&M.  A recent United Nations report found 80% of female-owned firms in emerging markets struggle to get credit. Surmounting sexism to invest more in women could boost the global economy by up to $5 trillion - about the size of Japan's economy, the Boston Consulting group said last year.  The report offers advice for investors and other financial businesses who it said are “uniquely positioned” to drive change - and also stand to benefit from businesses neglected by rivals. Key steps include training men to shed bias, hiring more women to make funding decisions, and making investors aware that female pitches may be less bombastic - and much more realistic. Funding women can also create a “domino effect” beyond work, said Reintje van Haeringen of humanitarian organization CARE, which works with the H&M Foundation to help women entrepreneurs. “Women are often seen to have a modest role in their families' decision making and the business gives them the self-confidence and opportunity to grow,” she told the Thomson  Foundation.  “With the increased income and that extra power, they start transforming their whole communities,” she said.

"Indian shares rebound after sharp fall, banks gain",Jan 23 2020,"BENGALURU, Jan 23 () - Indian shares rebounded on Thursday after a sharp pullback this week, driven by bargain-hunting and well-received earnings reports from Axis Bank and Larsen & Toubro (L&T). The NSE Nifty 50 index, which has slid 2% this week amid concerns over economic growth and poor corporate earnings, was up 0.49% at 12,165.50 by 0429 GMT. The S&P BSE Sensex was higher by 0.56% at 41,345.25. Meanwhile, other Asian markets wilted as investors fretted over the spread of a new flu-like virus in China just as millions prepared to travel for the Lunar New Year. Banking shares led the rebound in Indian markets. The Nifty banking index, down 2.81% this week through Wednesday, was higher by 0.64%, while the Nifty PSU bank index that tracks state-run lenders rose 1.07%. “There is value-buying at lower levels due to the recent correction,” said A.K. Prabhakar, head of research at IDBI Capital in Mumbai. “A few stocks have corrected more than the market, and they offer attractive entry points.” Poorly received earnings from top Indian companies this week dented risk appetite, but investors took heart from Axis Bank's better-than-expected net interest margins and construction firm L&T sticking to its revenue growth outlook despite macroeconmic challenges. Axis Bank was up 2.9%, while L&T rose 2.6%. Both stocks were among the top gainers on the Nifty 50. The government's move last year to cut corporate taxes is also helping companies report healthier profits. But some economists say those actions may not be enough to stimulate growth, particularly as inflation touched a 40-month high in November. Analysts have said Indian markets will likely remain volatile until the government presents the federal budget on Feb. 1, when it may also unveil more measures to lift growth.

"After China trade deal, Europe and UK next on Trump's to-do list",Jan 23 2020,"WASHINGTON () - U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to rip up international trade deals and rebalance America's global trade relationships. Three years into his presidency, he has done just that, using a slew of tariffs, threats, and bilateral talks to shake up relations with nearly every major U.S. trading partner.  Graphic: United States top trade partners  With a Phase 1 trade deal in hand with China, and a revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) complete at home, Trump is now turning his attention to Europe, post-Brexit Britain, and India.  Here's what's likely to happen next:  Washington and the European Union remain at odds over aircraft subsidies, trade barriers, and plans by European countries to impose taxes on digital services. Trump this week renewed threats to impose “Section 232” tariffs of up to 25% on auto imports from the EU, even though he missed a November deadline set by U.S. law to decide on the tariffs.   The EU will respond to any additional tariffs with duties of its own, Germany's ambassador to the United States, Emily Haber, said on Wednesday. France on Monday agreed to suspend a 3% digital tax on U.S. tech companies in exchange for Washington holding off on a threat to impose tariffs of up to 100% on a $2.4 billion list of French imports, a French diplomatic source said. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Italy and Britain will also face tariffs if they impose digital taxes.  Washington has already imposed a 25% tariff on European wines and other goods, and a 10% tariff on aircraft, and threatened to raise those tariffs and expand the list of affected products if the subsidy issue is not resolved. Trump has been promising a “massive” new trade deal with the U.K., the United States' seventh-largest trading partner, since British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's election win in December, but a rift opened between the two countries this week.  After Mnuchin and Trump both threatened to put tariffs on imports from Britain if it proceeds with a planned digital tax, Britain's finance minister Sajid Javid said it would go ahead with the tax in April anyway. Javid also said at Davos that a new trade deal with the EU was Britain's “first priority” ahead of a deal with the United States.   Trump is expected to sign into law in coming weeks  legislation that will implement the new United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement. Mexico has already ratified the deal, which replaces the 26-year-old NAFTA, and Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pushing for the Canadian Parliament to ratify it as quickly as possible. His Conservative opposition wants more time to study the agreement.  The United States eliminated India's special trade status under the Generalized System of Preferences in June, affecting some $5.6 billion worth of Indian exports to the United States, amid a dispute over India's new digital trade restrictions.  Both governments had hoped to hammer out a limited trade deal in September, but negotiations fell apart over tariffs on U.S. farm products and approval schedules for Indian pharmaceuticals.  Discussions have heated up again ahead of Trump's expected visit to India in February. Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in September signed a limited trade deal that cuts tariffs on U.S. farm goods, Japanese machine tools and other products, deferring a threat of higher U.S. car duties. The two countries are due to tackle the automotive issue in a second round of negotiations expected to start in April.  The United States and China are expected to start talks on thorny issues such as Chinese subsidies as part of a Phase 2 trade deal, after Washington agreed in December to roll back some tariffs in exchange for China's pledge to buy $200 billion more in U.S. goods and services over the next two years. Trade experts are skeptical that any agreement will occur before the U.S. presidential election in November. ","{'neg': 0.067, 'neu': 0.834, 'pos': 0.099, 'compound': 0.9812}",0.9812

Japan exports shrink for 13th month in further blow to economy,Jan 23 2020,"TOKYO () - Japan's exports fell for a 13th straight month in December, hurt by U.S.-bound shipments of cars, construction and mining machinery, suggesting weak external demand is likely to remain a drag on the trade-reliant economy for a while longer. The 6.3% year-on-year fall in exports was worse than a 4.2% decrease expected by economists in a  poll. It followed a revised 7.9% year-on-year decline in the previous month, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) data showed on Thursday. Analysts and policymakers say a preliminary trade deal agreed between the United States and China last week and progress on Britain's exit from the European Union would help ease worries over global trade, a key driver of Japan's economy. Yet, the latest data showed only a modest slowing in the pace of contraction and suggests a sure-footed recovery may be months away. “Exports are likely to bottom out around this spring,” said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, citing a pick-up in global semiconductor demand. A rush in shipments ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays may have helped ease the export slowdown last month, he added, suggesting there may be a further contraction in January. “Shipments are unlikely to serve as a main engine of growth this year due to the economic slowdown in the United States and China,” Minami said. Bank of Japan policymakers have argued that solid domestic demand should help offset weak shipments and manufacturing activity. On Tuesday, the BOJ nudged up its economic growth forecasts and sounded cautiously optimistic about the global outlook, though it said ongoing risks meant it was way too early to consider scaling down its massive stimulus.  By region, exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, grew 0.8% in the year to December, led by demand for chip-making equipment, cars and plastic. It was the first annual increase in 10 months. Shipments to the United States, the country's No. 2 trading partner, fell 14.9% year-on-year in December - a fifth straight month of falls - dragged down by cars, car parts and airplane motor engines, the MOF data showed. Exports to Asia, which accounts for more than half of Japan's overall shipments, decreased 3.6% in the year to December, it showed. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Thursday the progress in U.S.-China trade talks and Brexit helped ease risk sentiment, but added that uncertainty remains on the trade relations between Washington and Beijing. “While risks surrounding global growth have subsided somewhat, they remain large,” he told a news conference, signaling the BOJ's resolve to keep its powerful easing. The International Monetary Fund on Monday trimmed its 2020 global growth forecasts on sharper-than-expected slowdowns in emerging markets, but said the U.S.-China deal was another sign that manufacturing activity may soon bottom out. Many economists expect the world's third largest economy to have shrunk in the final quarter of last year as the U.S.-China trade war hit exports and the Oct. 1 sales tax hike weighed on private consumption. A moderate rebound is seen in the current quarter. ","{'neg': 0.067, 'neu': 0.84, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.9032}",0.9032
Endometriosis drug reduces bleeding in women with fibroids,Jan 23 2020,"( Health) - The AbbVie drug elagolix, already used to treat the pain of endometriosis, can significantly reduce the chances of heavy menstrual bleeding caused by uterine fibroids, according to the results of two studies reported in The New England Journal of Medicine. Uterine fibroids are non-cancerous growths in the uterus that can cause problems such as pain, pressure, heavy periods and infertility in as many as half the women who have them. They are very common, particularly among African American women. The elagolix treatment, if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, could give women a new option for dealing with the bleeding. Current treatment sometimes involves injections given monthly or every three months. Elagolix is a pill whose effects appear and fade much more rapidly and predictably. The new studies did not directly compare the two treatments. “This does provide a different approach and many women may prefer that,” lead study author Dr. William Schlaff of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia told  Health in a telephone interview. “We know it's effective for at least six months. If that can be prolonged, it could act as a bridge to get to menopause, where hormone levels drop naturally.” “But if you're 32 years old (with a fibroid bleeding problem) this may not be a bridge you want to use for 20 years,” he said. Such women may want to consider a hysterectomy or some other option. The two new studies - which were identical - followed a total of 790 women with a menstrual blood loss of more than 80 milliliters (about 2.7 ounces) per month. At the six-month mark, among women getting placebo treatment, 8.7% in one study and 10% in the other saw their monthly blood loss reduced by at least 50%. When the women were given elagolix alone, the success rates were 84.1% in one study and 77% in the other. The treatment suppresses ovarian sex hormones, increasing the odds of osteoporosis. So in some women, doctors also gave hormone therapy to compensate. With that hormonal “add-back therapy,” monthly flow was still reduced by at least 50% in 68.5% of women in one study and in 76.5% in the other. Add-back therapy alleviated decreases in bone mineral density caused by elagolix but it also increased the number of hot flushes in both trials, and in one trial, it increased the likelihood of spotting between periods, the researchers found. Most side effects of the drug “were considered by the investigators to be mild or moderate in severity,” they reported. The studies, known as Elaris UF-1 and Elaris UF-2, were financed by AbbVie, which sells the drug under the brand name Orilissa. The 300-milligram twice-daily elagolix treatment would cost more than $47,000 per year, according to prices on goodrx.com. In contrast, monthly leuprolide injections, which are an established treatment, costs roughly $7,000 per year. Compared with placebo recipients, elagolix recipients with add-back therapy also had higher levels of the oxygen-carrying protein hemoglobin in their blood and were more likely to have their periods cease altogether.  They also tended to score higher on quality of life questionnaires. Schlaff, who chairs the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Thomas Jefferson, predicted that if the drug is approved for fibroid bleeding, it will change the way women are treated. “A lot of women want to use oral medication” instead of periodic injections, he said. “Women are going to say, ‘I don't want to commit to a 1- or 3-month dose.' Or they may want to start with one and move to another.” (This story has been refiled to correct brand name of drug in paragraph 12)    SOURCE: ","{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.929, 'pos': 0.044, 'compound': 0.803}",0.803
Breakingviews - Flying cars are a cool solution to a tiny problem,Jan 23 2020,"HONG KONG ( Breakingviews) - Flying cars are almost a thing. Toyota Motor is investing close to $400 million in Joby Aviation, a startup that wants to cut commutes by floating over congestion. China's Geely is backing rival Volocopter; Hyundai is collaborating with Uber Elevate. But an investment by a $232 billion automaker lends much cred to what was once a metaphor for the impossible. New technology has put air taxis within reach, and regulators are wrapping their heads around the idea. The trick is finding customers. The hardware is in place, thanks to advances in software and materials. A 2019 catalogue of so-called vertical take-off and land craft, or VTOL, lists more than 250 electric models for sale. Engineers have conducted successful test flights in Singapore and San Francisco. Last month, the European Aviation Safety Agency approved Volocopter's designs. Proponents say that compared to the helicopter, flying cars are easier to control, plus cleaner and quieter – qualities aviation regulators appreciate. Ambitious companies hope to launch commercial products and services in the next two years. The final barrier is profit. Carmakers like Toyota can add value by helping the engineers produce at scale. But demand looks limited. Early targets are wealthier passengers making point-to-point trips over low-density urban areas, in places where the ground infrastructure is clogged. Use cases include short airport transfers, for example, or quick hops between islands.  There are other potential applications in cargo and agriculture. China's EHang, which listed on the Nasdaq in December, has multiple revenue streams including the sale of autonomous passenger vehicles and aerial drone display services. But its prospectus recorded a net loss of $6.7 million in the first nine months of 2019. Other startups are similarly unprofitable, according to an analysis by PitchBook. Today's flying cars may be variations of the helicopter, but that industry was worth less than $50 billion in 2018 including military craft, according to Fortune Business Insights.  Refinitiv data shows Airbus Helicopters, one of the few that publishes financials, posted negative EBITDA for three years ending in 2018. The pursuit of clean vehicles is straining carmaker's finances. Flying cars are fun, but until consumers climb aboard, investors might get taken for a ride.

"Facing economic crisis, Lebanon's government weighs options",Jan 22 2020,"BEIRUT () - Lebanon's Hezbollah-backed government will be walking a political tightrope as it looks to secure urgent foreign funding to ward off financial collapse, and it may look to the International Monetary Fund for assistance. Prime Minister Hassan Diab's cabinet is also facing increasingly violent protests against a political elite that has led Lebanon into its worst crisis since the 1975-90 civil war. Formed by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its allies, the cabinet faces an economic crisis at a time when Gulf Arab states, who along with Washington label Hezbollah a terrorist group, appear no longer willing to bail out Lebanon.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a statement on the new government, did not refer to Hezbollah, but emphasized the need for reform and fighting corruption. “Only a government that is capable of and committed to undertaking real and tangible reforms will restore investor confidence and unlock international assistance for Lebanon,” Pompeo said.  President Michel Aoun tasked the government at its first meeting on Wednesday with restoring international confidence, which could unlock funding and ease a liquidity crunch that hit the Lebanese pound, fueled inflation and forced bank controls. A senior politician, Alain Aoun, told  on Wednesday that an IMF program is an option for Lebanon depending on terms that should be bearable for the country and not trigger social unrest. On Wednesday, some protesters unhappy with the new cabinet breached a small security barricade near parliament in downtown Beirut and set on fire a tent for security forces, who responded with tear gas and water cannon. The skirmishes extended to a nearby luxury shopping district. A civil defense worker told local media some people suffered slight injuries. Last weekend, hundreds were injured in similar clashes. Lebanon had been without effective government since Saad al-Hariri, the country's main Sunni Muslim leader and a traditional ally of the West and Gulf states, resigned as premier in October. Diab's cabinet was formed on Tuesday by Hezbollah and allies, including the Free Patriotic Movement founded by Aoun, without the participation of major Lebanese political parties that enjoy Western support. Lebanon sovereign dollar-bonds moved higher by as much as 1 cent on Wednesday with the formation of a government.  Lebanon, burdened with a public debt equivalent to about 150% of GDP, won pledges exceeding $11 billion at an international conference in 2018 conditional on reforms that it has so far failed to implement.  “Your mission is delicate,” President Aoun's office cited him as telling the cabinet. “It is necessary to work to tackle the economic situation, restore the confidence of the international community in Lebanese institutions and reassure the Lebanese about their future.” Diab has said his first trip abroad would be to the Gulf region - but he will have his work cut out to reassure U.S.-allied rulers there who are concerned about Hezbollah's rising influence in Beirut.     Lebanon's banking association said on Wednesday it expected the cabinet to put forward a clear economic and financial program, offering the banks' support. A push by Lebanon to rein in a parallel market for dollars hit a snag on Wednesday when currency dealers largely refused to sell at a lower price agreed by the union of exchange dealers with the central bank. Highlighting challenges ahead, Finance Minister Ghazi Wazni told local media it was unlikely the Lebanese pound exchange rate to the U.S. dollar would “return to what it was” on the parallel market. Wazni had also described forthcoming foreign currency sovereign debt maturities as “a fireball”. Lebanon should restructure its Eurobonds, including a $1.2 billion Eurobond maturing in March, and secure a multi-billion-dollar IMF bailout, its former labor minister Camille Abousleiman told . “I don't see the logic of the system leaking $500 to $600 million out of Lebanon on the March payment when an actual restructuring of the Eurobonds is next to inevitable.” ","{'neg': 0.103, 'neu': 0.782, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.9194}",0.9194

Finance wants competitiveness role for UK watchdogs after Brexit,Jan 23 2020,"LONDON () - Britain's regulators should have a formal role after Brexit to keep the financial sector globally competitive and less prone to  “gold-plating” international norms, an industry think tank said on Thursday. The International Regulatory Strategy Group (IRSG) said new thinking and targeted reforms were required after Britain leaves the European Union on Jan. 31. UK regulators will write its own financial rules instead of applying those fashioned by Brussels. “Brexit does change the structure around regulation and we need to reflect that,” Mark Hoban, chair of the IRSG and a former UK financial services minister, told . The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England are responsible for keeping markets and financial firms safe and stable. But in a report on regulation after Brexit, the IRSG called for a secondary remit of ensuring that rules do not put the financial sector at a competitive disadvantage to New York, Frankfurt or other rival centers. British regulators have resisted such calls, fearing it would increase pressure to ease rules. Their predecessors had to “have regard” to Britain's global financial role and were tarnished by a “light-touch” reputation after the financial crisis a decade ago. “The use of the word competitiveness is often quite loaded,” said Julian Adams, regulatory and government relations director at insurer M&G, and chair of the IRSG report. “This is not code for a race to the bottom,” said Adams, also a former senior insurance regulator at the Bank of England.  The IRSG is sponsored by the City of London financial district and TheCityUK, which promotes Britain as a financial center. Britain will remain a member of international financial standard setters after Brexit, whose norms typically form the basis for national or EU laws that Britain has often “gold-plated” - or toughened up. The report calls for Britain to formally take into account international norms when writing rules to avoid exceeding them unnecessarily in a way that would harm UK competitiveness. “You make sure the global standard is as good as you want it to be and need it to be as a regulator, and then you would try and limit to the extent possible any gold-plating,” Adams said. UK rulemaking in isolation could also have implications for access to EU investors after Brexit, said Lucy Fergusson, lead author of the IRSG report and a lawyer at Linklaters. The report called for a new parliamentary committee to directly focus on financial rules. The competitiveness call is likely to get a sympathetic hearing from government, mindful that finance is Britain's biggest tax-raising sector which may not secure good future access to the EU, its biggest export customer.

"Michigan, Tesla settle suit over direct vehicle sales",Jan 23 2020,"WASHINGTON () - Tesla Inc and the state of Michigan confirmed Wednesday they have resolved the company's 2016 lawsuit challenging the state's refusal to allow the company to sell vehicles directly to consumers. The Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's office said a resolution filed in U.S. District Court recognizes “that any Michigan resident may lawfully buy a Tesla and have it serviced in Michigan.” The stipulation also says Tesla may “operate under existing Michigan law; sell cars to Michigan customers as long as the sales contract indicates the sale took place in a state other than Michigan; and, indirectly own service and repair facilities in Michigan through a subsidiary, Tesla Michigan.”  and other outlets reported the expected settlement on Tuesday. Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not sell its vehicles through a network of independent dealers. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk reacted to the settlement on Twitter writing: “Yay!” Tesla has filed a number of legal challenges over the years to state laws that prohibit or heavily restrict the ability of automakers to sell vehicles directly to consumers. The stipulation says Tesla may operate galleries in Michigan to “educate customers and facilitate transactions out-of-state.” Tesla may conduct demonstration drives, discuss prices, service, financing, leasing, and trade-ins with potential customers and facilitate “ordering and purchase of a vehicle for which legal title transfers out-of-state.” Tesla agreed to drop its suit and Michigan officials agreed to “take no enforcement action against Tesla or any Tesla  subsidiary” as long as it abided by the terms of the court papers.

Trump laments missing Davos star Greta's speech,Jan 22 2020,"DAVOS, Switzerland () - U.S. President Donald Trump called climate activists like Greta Thunberg “prophets of doom” at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday. By Wednesday he was lamenting not having watched the teenage activist's speech. The gentler tone, along with a promise to join a plan to plant one trillion trees, hinted at a different approach from the U.S. president, who in the past has dismissed climate change as “fake news” and told Thunberg she needs “anger management”. Either way, the first two days of the annual Davos gathering were dominated by the back-and-forth between the 73-year-old former businessman and the 17-year-old campaigner, with corporate leaders caught in the middle, concerned that as well as words, there was a need for concrete decisions. Thunberg doubled down at Davos. “Our house is still on fire,” the Swede said, decrying the “empty words and promises” of leaders and their message that children — millions of whom have joined Thunberg's Friday protests around the world — should not worry. “Your inaction is fuelling the flames,” she said. On Wednesday, she met Britain's Prince Charles, 71, a life-long environmentalist who tries to keep out of politics. “Everything I have tried to do, and urge, over the past fifty years has been done with our children and grandchildren in mind,” Charles said shortly before sitting down with Thunberg. He said he did not want to be accused by his descendants of doing nothing “except prevaricate and deny the problem”. “Now, of course, they are accusing us of exactly that.” Trump and the British heir to the throne did not cross paths, but as he left the mountain resort, Trump told reporters he would have liked to have heard Thunberg speak. Business leaders suggested Trump had been listening. Asked if he had convinced Trump to join the trillion trees initiative, Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff paused and smiled before telling  “many people” were involved. And Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of German giant Siemens, told  he had advised Trump to listen to young activists. “We have to sit together and involve them in dialogue,” he said he had told the U.S. president. Asked by reporters if he still thought climate change was a hoax, Trump responded: “No, not at all.”  But he said Thunberg should shift her attention away from the United States to focus on other, more polluted countries. “You have another continent where the fumes are rising at levels that you can't believe ... I think Greta ought to focus on those places,” he said. Other leaders sought to draw a middle ground between Trump and Thunberg. French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said the Europeans were leading with a different approach. “There exists a third way between Donald Trump and Greta Thunberg,” he told reporters.  “There's no need to fall into extremes, between those who say either that there is no problem with global warming or those who lament that nothing has been done to combat it, because it's not true – there are things that have been done.” Mark Carney, the outgoing head of the Bank of England who will shortly become a United Nations' envoy for climate policy, praised Thunberg for raising awareness of climate change. “There are those who will be out front in the transition and those who lag. And that's different than a binary green-good, everything else brown-bad,” he said. “There should be fifty shades of green, if not more.”  ","{'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.865, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': 0.4809}",0.4809
"Furious at federation, Russian star braces for prospect of second missed Olympics",Jan 23 2020,"MOSCOW () - High jumper Maria Lasitskene, a three-time world champion, is getting a feeling of deja vu as she readies for the prospect of missing a second consecutive Olympics because of doping scandals at Russia's athletics federation. Sidelined from the 2016 Rio Olympics because of the federation's suspension, Lasitskene says her chances of competing at this year's Tokyo Games are slim after a fresh scandal emerged last year at the beleaguered body. “There is absolutely no certainty, there is no understanding of what to expect,” the 27-year-old told  at the Salyut Geraklion stadium in northwestern Moscow on Wednesday. “The same thing could happen again.” Russia's athletics federation was suspended in 2015 after a report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of mass doping in the sport and had since been trudging toward reinstatement. But World Athletics, the global governing body of athletics formerly known as the IAAF, halted Russia's reinstatement process in November last year. The decision came after the federation's president and six other people were provisionally suspended for having provided forged documents to justify a whereabouts violation by high jumper Danil Lysenko. “Everyone was scrutinizing us from all sides. How could they allow such a thing to happen?,” Lasitskene sighed. “It's a complete mess and disrespects all athletes.” As a result of the scandal, World Athletics has for now stopped clearing Russians to compete internationally as neutrals, sidelining Lasitskene from international meets. It has also raised the possibility of expelling the Russian athletics federation altogether.  Lasitskene blames the federation for having deepened the crisis and is ready to sue it or some of its officials if she misses her winter season, including her chance to defend her world indoor title in March in China. “If I miss the winter season, unfortunately no one will compensate me for my losses, starting with huge losses to my image,” Lasitskene said.  “I've been trusted for years, given a neutral status. The whole world knew that I was clean. This now affects my image, my moral state and my finances.” Lasitskene said she feared her sponsor Nike would lower its funding if she were to be sidelined from the winter season. She will also miss out on crucial meets to prepare for the unlikely prospect of competing at the Tokyo Games.  “All competitions heading into the Olympics are like a chain,” she said. “Every competition builds up to it, and it's impossible to compensate for that in Russia.” The worsening crisis comes as Russia appeals a four-year ban from competing under its flag at major international events in all sports, including the Tokyo Olympics, as punishment for having provided WADA with doctored laboratory data.  Lasitskene said she hoped Russian athletes would win the right to compete under their flag, even though she is doubtful there will be any track and field stars from Russia in Tokyo.  “No one has ever apologised for all this time,” she said. “Because of their actions, I have lost a lot and it has affected me.” ","{'neg': 0.143, 'neu': 0.783, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': -0.9894}",-0.9894
"No alternative to grounded Boeing 737 MAX, Aercap CEO says",Jan 23 2020,"DUBLIN () - There is no alternative to the grounded 737 MAX and it would be “absolutely stupid” for Boeing () to launch a replacement before the next wave of technology a decade from now, the head of one of the world's top aircraft lessors said on Wednesday. Aengus Kelly, chief executive of Aercap (), which has committed to a fleet of 100 MAX jets, told  in an interview he had spoken to all of the biggest MAX operators in the world and said they still viewed it as a very good plane.  Kelly was speaking after Boeing on Tuesday warned of further delays in returning its grounded 737 MAX airliner to service, with the plane not likely to be cleared by U.S. regulators until the middle of the year. He said that some of his customers may cancel leases, but that the majority would not and some are keen to order more.  “For people to say this is the end of the MAX, that is absolutely incorrect. These people don't have much insight,” Kelly said. He said, however, it was still impossible to say when the MAX might fly again. “We saw another delay from Boeing last night – I don't think they know,” he said. “Is July the last delay? Who knows?” Asked if the MAX might be replaced in the coming years, a move that might undermine the jet's value, Kelly said it would be absolutely stupid for Boeing to launch a replacement plane before technology allows an additional 15% reduction in fuel burn, something he believes will not happen before 2030.  Kelly said all of the main aviation banks were still willing to lend money against the MAX, but added if that changed, the plane's valuation would be hit.  “Are the lessors and the banks willing to still finance the MAX and buy the MAX? The answer to that right now is yes. And if that is the case that puts a floor on the value of the aircraft,” he said. He acknowledged banks may insist on lower loan-to-value ratios on loans issued against the MAX than against rival Airbus planes.  Kelly said he would expect Boeing to compensate it if it is forced to take back leases and lease the plane to new airlines. Any costs due to the grounding or any fall in the planes value would also feed into talks on compensation, he said.  “We would expect Boeing shareholders to absorb that pain because its their fault not our shareholders,” he said.

How could they allow such a thing to happen?,” Lasitskene sighed. “It's a complete mess and disrespects all athletes.” As a result of the scandal, World Athletics has for now stopped clearing Russians to compete internationally as neutrals, sidelining Lasitskene from international meets. It has also raised the possibility of expelling the Russian athletics federation altogether. Lasitskene blames the federation for having deepened the crisis and is ready to sue it or some of its officials if she misses her winter season, including her chance to defend her world indoor title in March in China. “If I miss the winter season, unfortunately no one will compensate me for my losses, starting with huge losses to my image,” Lasitskene said. “I've been trusted for years, given a neutral status. The whole world knew that I was clean. This now affects my image, my moral state and my finances.” Lasitskene said she feared her sponsor Nike would lower its funding if she were to be sidelined from the winter season. She will also miss out on crucial meets to prepare for the unlikely prospect of competing at the Tokyo Games. “All competitions heading into the Olympics are like a chain,” she said. “Every competition builds up to it, and it's impossible to compensate for that in Russia.” The worsening crisis comes as Russia appeals a four-year ban from competing under its flag at major international events in all sports, including the Tokyo Olympics, as punishment for having provided WADA with doctored laboratory data. Lasitskene said she hoped Russian athletes would win the right to compete under their flag, even though she is doubtful there will be any track and field stars from Russia in Tokyo.

EXPLAINER-Can Lebanon's new government revive the economy?,Jan 23 2020,"(Repeats with amended slug; no changes to text) By Tom Arnold BEIRUT, Jan 22 () - After three months of political paralysis, Lebanon has finally formed a government under Prime Minister Hassan Diab. Now comes the task of saving the country from a biting financial crisis and winning over investors and foreign donors. Lebanon's public debt burden, equivalent to around 150% of GDP, and its twin current account and fiscal deficits looked unsustainable even before anti-government protesters took to the streets three months ago. With many of the international sovereign bonds trading at less than half their face value, market observers see an increasing likelihood of Lebanon struggling to repay some of its obligations and seek a restructuring with creditors at some point. One of the first tasks of the government will be to decide whether to proceed with a central bank proposal to ask local holders of some of this year's bonds, including a $1.2 billion issue maturing in March, to swap them for longer-dated ones to ease pressure on state finances. Any move to delay bond repayments could constitute a default in the eyes of credit rating agencies and risk pushing its credit rating further into junk territory. The Lebanese pound's 22-year-old peg to the U.S. dollar has been strained to near breaking point by the country's political and banking crisis. With the pound losing roughly a third of its official value on the black market as dollars have dried up, a devaluation has loomed increasingly large. Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh has previously ruled out any such move, saying the government has the means to maintain the peg. But without a revival in sagging capital flows and a recovery in Lebanon's external balance sheet, the central bank's ability to defend the peg will diminish. Banks have long served as a vital cog in keeping Lebanon's economy moving. By taking deposits from Lebanon's millions of scattered diaspora and snapping up the government's local debt, banks helped prop up the state's finances. But that system has broken as foreign deposits dry up in the face of a collapse in confidence in the banking system. Non-resident private sector deposits in the banking sector fell by 11.3% on an annual basis in November, while Lebanon faces a hard currency shortage - leaving Lebanese at home and abroad with restricted access to their bank funds. Some financial experts believe banks will require a deeper injection of cash than the 20% of capital they've been told by the central bank to raise. Lebanon is mired in recession and its recovery remains largely dependent on the government's ability to make reforms needed to secure international financial support. Lebanon needs a $20 billion-$25 billion bailout including International Monetary Fund support to emerge from its financial crisis, according to former economy minister Nasser Saidi. But assistance appears uncertain given Diab's support from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its allies. Diab has said his first trip abroad would be to the Arab region, particularly Gulf states. But Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have provided financial aid to Lebanon in the past, have appeared more circumspect during the latest crisis and may be even less willing to stump up with Diab in power. Instead, Lebanon may look to Qatar, accused by its Gulf neighbours of more closely aligning itself with Iran. It is unclear whether Diab will try to pursue an IMF bailout. Some observers warn the United States, the largest financial backer of those institutions, could oppose any such deal due to the government's Hezbollah ties. The United States regards Hezbollah as a terrorist group. ","{'neg': 0.115, 'neu': 0.816, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': -0.9792}",-0.9792
Argentine bonds fall as Buenos Aires province extends creditor deadline,Jan 22 2020,"BUENOS AIRES () - Argentine sovereign and provincial bonds dipped on Wednesday as the provincial government in Buenos Aires was forced to extend a deadline for creditors to agree or reject a plan to delay a $250 million bond repayment originally due on Jan. 26. The province said on Wednesday, minutes after the consent solicitation deadline had elapsed at 1pm (1600 GMT), that it would extend the cut-off for responses related to a 2021 bond until the same time on Jan. 31. The province needs to receive consent from holders of over 75% of the principal amount of debt. “To date we have received the support of a significant number of bondholders, and we continue in dialogue with institutional investors whose participation would allow us to arrive at the desired result,” Pablo Lopez, the province minister of treasury and finance, said in a statement. The payment on the 2021 bond marks the first major test for the South American country as it grapples with far more complex talks to restructure about $100 billion in public debts that the new Peronist government says it cannot currently pay. Ilya Gofshteyn, a senior emerging markets strategist at Standard Chartered Bank, said that if Buenos Aires could not get sufficient bondholder support, it likely reflected the “difficulties facing the sovereign restructuring discussions.” The provincial government said the terms of the bond gave it a grace period of 10 days for capital payments and 30 days for interest payments without triggering a default. Buenos Aires province, Argentina's largest by far, said this month it was seeking “temporary financial relief” from holders of the 2021 bond, and requested an extension to May 1 to make the repayment due this month. Without consent, the province - and the national government - will be in something of a bind, analysts said. “The alternatives are to either reach 75% agreement for consent solicitation to postpone the payment to May 1 or otherwise risk a hard default,” Amherst Pierpont said in a note on Wednesday, adding the question would be whether the state would intervene at the last minute. “It's a game of brinkmanship on whether either side caves in to avoid a hard default next week.” Prices for Argentina's over-the-counter (OTC) bonds were down on average around 1.3%, while Buenos Aires bonds fell across the board, led by a 3.5 point drop in the 2021 bond. Argentina's economy minister said on Tuesday the government was sending a debt sustainability bill to lawmakers to help bolster the country's ability to pay. Argentina's center-left President Alberto Fernandez has said the country needs to be given time by creditors, including the International Monetary Fund, to revive growth in order to be able to do so.

Venezuela's Guaido will seek to return to Caracas after European tour,Jan 23 2020,"BRUSSELS () - Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who defied a travel ban to seek support in Europe for new elections in his country, said on Wednesday he would attempt to return to Caracas but expected it to be dangerous. Speaking in the European Parliament in Brussels, Guaido also called on the EU to increase pressure on the government of President Nicolas Maduro through more sanctions, saying that while he believed in diplomacy, mediation had so far failed. “Yes I took a risk to leave ... my return will be risky,” he told a news conference following talks with EU lawmakers.     “It is sadistic what he (Maduro) is doing. He is torturing people, he is arresting people. Eighty percent of people in Venezuela can't get proper water supplies. There is no electricity.” Comparing Venezuela's plight to Syria and Yemen, Guaido said Maduro's attempts to prevent him from being re-elected as the head of the opposition earlier this month had made him more determined to see the president unseated from power. He said several of his assistants in Caracas had been arrested in his absence. Guaido went on Tuesday to London, where he met British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, then to Brussels and will go to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.  “We need to put pressure on the dictatorship obviously. Sanctions will do that. We need to try to do everything possible to do that,” he said, adding that he was “hoping for a miracle.” EU countries, which recognize Guaido as interim president of Venezuela, have imposed economic sanctions on 25 Venezuelans close to Maduro, but have opted for a softer approach compared to the United States, seeking to help mediate talks toward new elections with Norway and Latin American countries. Guaido also appealed to EU governments to prohibit the trade of Venezuelan gold, a source of income for Maduro as oil production collapses, saying it was “blood gold” financing oppression.

U.S. home sales surge to near two-year high; supply at record low,Jan 22 2020,"WASHINGTON () - U.S. home sales jumped to their highest level in nearly two years in December, the latest indication that lower mortgage rates are helping the housing market to regain its footing after hitting a soft patch in 2018, though record low inventory could be an obstacle to continued strong gains. The report from the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday followed on the heels of government data last week showing homebuilding raced to a 13-year high in December. Renewed housing market momentum could soften some of the hit on the economy from manufacturing as the thaw in U.S.-China trade tensions is offset by Boeing's () suspension this month of production of its troubled 737 MAX plane. “The previous weak link, housing, is coming back, but the current laggard, manufacturing, is slowing further,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. Existing home sales increased 3.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million units last month, the highest level since February 2018, boosted by a surge in sales of multi-family housing units and gains in single-family home dwellings. November's sales pace was unrevised at 5.35 million units. Economists polled by  had forecast existing home sales would increase 1.3% to a rate of 5.43 million units in December. Last month, existing home sales rose in the Northeast, West and the populous South. But sales fell in the Midwest. Existing home sales, which make up about 90% of U.S. home sales, surged 10.0% on a year-on-year basis in December. For all of 2019, sales were unchanged at 5.34 million units. The report helped to lift the PHLX housing index .HGX. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, also cheered by an upbeat forecast from IBM () and China's efforts to contain a new flu-like virus outbreak. The dollar .DXY was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. The housing market is being supported by cheaper mortgage rates after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times last year. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to an average of 3.65% from its peak of 4.94% in November 2018, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.  But the sector, which accounts for about 3.1% of gross domestic product, remains constrained by a lack of homes,  especially in the lower-priced segment of the market, because of land and labor shortages.  The supply squeeze and resulting reacceleration in house price inflation could slow home sales this year. According to the NAR, there was a 14% drop from a year earlier in sales of houses priced $100,000 and below.  “Still, with rising incomes, more households being formed, and low mortgage rates, demand for housing should remain robust to keep home sales activity at an elevated level – although likely little changed from 2019,” said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.  December's increase in existing homes sales likely means more in brokers' commissions, which suggests that housing probably contributed to GDP growth again in the fourth quarter. Residential investment rebounded in the third quarter after contracting for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the 2007-2009 recession. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP to rise at a 1.8% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the July-September period. The government will publish its snapshot of fourth-quarter GDP next Thursday. There were a record-low 1.40 million previously owned homes on the market in December, down 14.6% from November and 8.5% from a year ago. As a result, the median existing house price soared 7.8% from a year ago, the most since January 2016, to $274,500 in December. House prices increased 4.8% in 2019. The NAR report likely exaggerates the pace of house price appreciation because of sampling methodology.  In a separate report on Wednesday, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) said its house price index rose a seasonally adjusted 4.9% in November from a year ago, slowing from an increase of 5.2% in October.  According to JPMorgan economist Daniel Silver, the FHFA measure is considered one of the more reliable house price measures “that control for changes in the mix of sales.” The NAR report showed that at December's sales pace, it would take a record few 3.0 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.7 months in November.  A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. Last month, houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 41 days, up from 38 days in November, but down from 46 days a year ago. Forty-three percent of homes sold in December were on the market for less than a month.  First-time buyers accounted for 31% of sales last month, slightly down from 32% in November and a year ago. They accounted for 33% of all transactions in 2019. ","{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.885, 'pos': 0.067, 'compound': 0.9676}",0.9676

"Global deal over digital tax eludes France, U.S. in Davos talks",Jan 23 2020,"DAVOS () - France and the United States failed on Wednesday to agree how to push forward a global rewrite of decades-old cross-border tax rules though they agreed to set aside a bilateral row on digital taxation, France's finance minister said on Wednesday. Governments from nearly 140 countries aim to give their backing to pursue what would be the biggest overhaul of international tax rules since the 1920s at the end of the month at the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. But preparations led in part by France and the United States have been eclipsed by a bilateral dispute between the two with Washington threatening retaliatory tariffs against Paris' own national tax on big tech companies that book out-sized profits on French income despite minimal physical presence. The United States has further complicated the backdrop for a global deal by proposing last month that the future rules should be optional for companies. Calling a truce until the end of the year, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he had agreed with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Davos that France would not require companies to pay its digital tax this year and that Mnuchin had agreed to suspend the tariff threat in the mean time. Le Maire added: “The U.S. and France committed themselves to work on a global international solution on digital taxation and international taxation.” “But we still need to have a clear understanding of what will be the working basis at the OECD and we want this basis to be solid, credible and fair.” He said that the future tax rules could not be credible if they were optional for companies and said he would meet again with Mnuchin on Thursday to discuss the issue.

"'It's the pension, stupid!' Retirement row ignites Irish election",Jan 23 2020,"DUBLIN () - Longstanding plans to increase Ireland's statutory retirement age and the knock-on effects on pension payments have become an unexpected issue ahead of the Feb. 8 election, putting the government on the back foot. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar called the election last week, but a pitch putting his diplomatic successes on Brexit at the center of the campaign has fallen flat with an electorate more concerned about deficits in housing and healthcare. The issue of pensions has dominated the campaign in recent days amid anger from some private sector workers over being forced to retire at 65 but having to sign up for unemployment benefit until their state pension kicks in aged 66. Similar to other countries, Ireland raised the retirement age to 66 in 2014 but it is the long laid-out plan to raise it again to 67 from next year that has exercised older voters. The threshold is due to increase again to 68 in 2028. “It's the pension, stupid. That's what's going to win the election,” Eugene, a 65-year-old caller to national broadcaster RTE's Liveline phone-in talk show, said on Wednesday.  He was referring to Bill Clinton's successful 1992 U.S. presidential slogan: “It's the economy, stupid!”    “It's a bridge too far (moving the age to 67), and they thought they'd get away with it.”   The pension age has dominated Liveline, the second most listened-to radio program in the country, in recent days. Sinn Fein, Ireland's third largest party which an opinion poll on Monday put just two points behind Varadkar's Fine Gael and four shy of the main opposition Fianna Fail, may have struck a chord with voters by calling for the retirement age to be brought back to 65. While the two larger parties refuse to govern with Sinn Fein - the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), a potential government partner, the smaller Labour Party, also wants the qualifying age to return to 65. The debate has resulted in Fine Gael and Fianna Fail committing to introduce a transition payment equivalent to the contributory state pension so that workers retiring at 65 do not need to claim unemployment benefit to make up the difference.  Fianna Fail, currently leading in the polls, has also said it will review the qualifying age if elected.  “It has to be acknowledged that this is a very significant issue at the doorsteps,” Fianna Fail finance spokesman Michael McGrath, the favorite to become Ireland's next finance minister, told a news conference on Wednesday.

Wirecard to beef up management; Braun to stay: new chairman,Jan 23 2020,"BERLIN () - The new chairman of Wirecard said the German payments company needed to strengthen its top management as it fights allegations of fraud and false accounting, while giving Chief Executive Markus Braun a vote of confidence. Braun's contract expiring at the end of this year will definitely be extended, Thomas Eichelmann told Manager Magazine in an interview published on Wednesday.

Outside auditor KPMG was hired last autumn to investigate all the FT's allegations and is expected to report back by the end of the first quarter. Wirecard itself denies wrongdoing. Eichelmann, a former chief financial officer of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange elected chairman in December, said Wirecard needed to beef up both its management and supervisory boards by two members each to ease the burden on Braun. “A management board member for personnel would make sense in my opinion, as would one for international marketing,” Eichelmann told Manager Magazine. “We could do with more capacity and competence in the supervisory board too.”Austrian Braun has run Wirecard since 2002 and owns a 7% stake in it that is worth 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion).

Dutch power firm TenneT sets up unit focused on EU green targets,Jan 23 2020,"Berlin () - Dutch-German power grid company TenneT is setting up a new business unit focused on the European Union's “Green New Deal” project to make the bloc carbon-neutral by 2050. Chief Executive Manon van Beek told  the new energy systems unit would be tasked with spotting opportunities to raise efficiency and improve cross-border planning.  TenneT, owned by the Dutch state, is already the largest investor in Germany's shift towards renewable energy. “The unit will start in the second quarter and will have around 50 employees,” van Beek said at a conference. “That also involves partnerships with gas grid operators, like the one with (Dutch peer) Gasunie,” she added. The department will be headed by a German national, Peter Hoffmann, currently senior manager system operations. TenneT's investments in Germany are financed by grid fees that are charged to electricity consumers. That puts its activities under the scrutiny of the energy regulator, which seeks to cut customer bills. Massive costs are stretching the company's ability to keep up with the runaway expansion of power from volatile renewable sources, such as wind and sunshine. It has published a 35-billion euros ($36 billion) ten-year investment programme for the Netherlands and Germany, including  new underground and sea cables to carry green power. Renewables have grown to account for about 40% of Germany's power generation, with 65% being the 2030 target. “For some 2030 is a long way out, for us it's basically tomorrow,” van Beek said. Costs to keep networks stable are another burden. Staff and equipment must be in place to cope with the intermittency of renewables supplies, as new grids are only being built slowly. TenneT in 2019 incurred 925 million euros in grid handling costs in Germany, a sum similar to 2018, van Beek said. This was made up to 555 million euros for dealing with surplus wind, 180 million for so-called redispatch measures, and the rest for readying network reserves and standby capacity. These steps are necessary because grids must be balanced and there is not yet enough storage for surpluses. “I don't see the magnitude of those costs changing much in the coming years,” van Beek said. She added that she expected by the summer an agreement with the Dutch finance minister on how to plug a 2-3 billion euros additional equity funding gap to secure the 10-year spending plan. “We want to keep our credit rating,” she said.

Warren calls on big U.S. banks for steps on climate risk,Jan 22 2020,"SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON () - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a contender for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, is asking the biggest U.S. banks for details on their assessments of and preparations for risks related to global warming. “To protect themselves and the economy from climate-driven catastrophes, large financial institutions must act quickly to address risks,” Warren, a frequent critic of big banks, said in letters sent on Tuesday to top executives at Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, State Street and Wells Fargo.  “I write to ask for more information about the risks caused by the climate crisis on the financial industry and your institution's practices, including what steps, if any, your institution is taking to adapt to mitigate these risks,” she said in the letters, provided to .  She asked for detailed written responses by Feb. 7. Over the past year a surge in natural disasters caused or exacerbated by warming temperatures, including bushfires in Australia, have driven climate change up the political agenda around the world and sparked protests demanding action.  The threat has caught the attention of financial regulators concerned with how rising seas and other consequences of the build-up of human-generated greenhouse gases could impact financial stability by, for instance, eroding the value of homes against which banks have lent hundreds of billions of dollars.  Regulators are also focused on assessing the potential impact of political responses to climate change on bank profitability and even viability, even as the world's largest banks are increasingly targeted by activists for providing funding to fossil-fuel intensive industries, a major contributor to global warming.  Led by the Bank of England, dozens of central banks have called for better disclosure of risks related to climate change and have begun mapping out approaches to banking sector supervision that take such risks into account. At its first-ever conference on climate change and economics last November, the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled it too may look at how to incorporate climate change risk into its assessments of financial stability. A panel convened by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission has begun its own effort to examine climate threats to the financial system.  But overall, U.S. financial regulators lag their peers abroad.  The current Republican U.S. administration has played down research on the risks of global warming and rolled back regulations designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions. On Tuesday, at the World Economic Forum in Davos where environmental issues have taken center stage, President Donald Trump dismissed those worried by climate change as “perennial prophets of doom.”  Warren is among a group of leading Democrats vying for the party's nomination to take on Trump in the November contest for U.S. president, but trails former Vice President Joe Biden and fellow U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in most opinion polls. All three are in favor of more government action to reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to limit impacts on the U.S. economy. Warren last year was a co-signer of a bill that would direct the Fed to “stress test” banks' resilience to climate-related financial risks. In her letter, Warren asked the banks for details on how the proposed legislation would affect their operations as well as investments in oil companies, and whether they would support such a law.  She also asked whether they formally assess climate-related risks and what changes they may have made in response. “As climate change continues to affect our economy, it is critical to understand your bank's adaptation and mitigation strategies,” Warren wrote.   Many large U.S. banks, including those receiving Warren's letter, acknowledge that climate change poses a business risk and some make some disclosures about their own climate-related risks in line with recommendations from the international Financial Stability Board.   asked each bank for comment on Warren's letter after normal business hours.  A JPMorgan spokesman said the bank was reviewing the letter. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman pointed to the environmental sustainability section of its website, which touts its financing of clean technology and environmental education, and a State Street spokesman, while declining comment, noted the bank's track record on the issue, which includes support for carbon pricing.

Breakingviews - Banks feel the heat of global warming in Davos,Jan 22 2020,"DAVOS, Switzerland ( Breakingviews) - Banks are feeling the heat of global warming in Davos. Climate change is the dominant topic at this year's elite gathering in the Swiss mountain resort, and financial institutions are firmly in the spotlight. Fund management giant BlackRock's pledge to vote against directors of companies that aren't taking enough action may force some to make changes. But demands by regulators that banks manage the risks of a warmer planet will have more bite. For the executives, financiers, policymakers and other hangers-on who flocked to Davos this year, environmental concerns are the main subject of conversation. Even before the conflab started, the World Economic Forum's members flagged issues like extreme weather, loss of biodiversity, and failure to tackle climate change as the biggest risks facing the planet, relegating more immediate threats like infectious diseases and war in the Middle East. On Tuesday, teenage activist Greta Thunberg castigated delegates for their lack of action, while even U.S. President Donald Trump, a vocal fossil fuel enthusiast, pledged America's support for an initiative to plant 1 trillion new trees. Asset managers are also turning up the temperature. BlackRock boss Larry Fink's annual letter to chief executives, published last week, put listed companies on notice that the giant asset manager might vote against directors who it feels have made insufficient progress in tackling climate risks. Arguably a bigger question, however, is how banks factor the threat to the planet into their credit decisions. Most big companies have relatively little need for equity capital, but still have to refinance their borrowings on a regular basis. Lenders like Standard Chartered have already stopped extending credit to new coal projects. But many bank executives still publicly take the view it's not up to them to be the agents of change. “I certainly don't want the banking industry used as the sharp end of the spear, forcing behaviours,” Mike Corbat, chief executive of Citigroup, said in a video interview with Breakingviews on Tuesday. That stance is becoming harder to defend, though. Regulators are increasingly demanding that banks treat the threat posed by climate change for what it is: a large and hard-to-quantify financial risk. The Bank of England is planning to stress test banks and insurers to quantify the hit to their business from a range of global warming scenarios. A senior executive at one large non-UK lender told Breakingviews that it intended to run similar checks. Testing financial portfolios for climate risks poses several challenges. For one, it requires institutions to imagine cataclysmic scenarios the modern world has never experienced before. Second, while the physical impact of a warmer planet on people and businesses may manifest itself slowly, financial markets could adjust violently, particularly if governments make sudden shifts in policy. At separate Breakingviews events this month, activist investor Jeff Ubben and David Blood, co-founder of Generation Investment Management, both predicted that the United States would introduce a tax on carbon much sooner than investors expect. Yet while individual banks and fund managers can shun problematic investments, carbon-intensive assets won't just disappear. “The financial system is a mirror of the real economy and will reflect those risks,” Sarah Breeden, executive director at the Bank of England, told a Breakingviews panel last week. Central banks are also concerned they will end up having to buy assets that nobody else wants to hold, becoming what the Bank for International Settlements this week called “climate rescuers of last resort”. As they shuttled between meetings with clients this week, senior bank executives expressed several concerns about the new focus on climate risks. One worry is that overly crude metrics of exposure to, say, coal don't capture the progress companies might be making in transitioning their business away from fossil fuels. Another gripe is that increased scrutiny by banks and asset managers in the west will have little impact on the behaviour of companies in large swathes of the world beyond the reach of international capital markets - particularly China. Finally, financiers are also keen to stress the need to stimulate financing of renewable forms of energy. Like other topics that have dominated debates at Davos in previous years, the risk is that climate concerns are overtaken by other challenges before companies are pressed into action. The big shift, however, is that banks, insurers and asset managers are increasingly treating global warming as a financial risk that has to be managed. That transition is likely to prove permanent.

Putin hoping to secure economic legacy with reshuffle: sources,Jan 22 2020,"MOSCOW () - A Russian government reshuffle that brought in a new first deputy prime minister and a new economy minister is an attempt by President Vladimir Putin to secure his economic legacy, say two sources close to the government, but it also carries risks.   The reshuffle, which remodeled the government's economic decision-making bloc, is fuelling concerns about higher state spending and inflation risks, though analysts say they expect Russia's robust fiscal framework to survive. Putin approved the new government on Tuesday and described it as a break with the past. The sources said Putin hopes the reshuffle will help accelerate implementation of a vast state spending plan seen as the centerpiece of what may be his final presidential term.     The plan envisages breathing new life into Russia's stagnant economy by spending more than 25 trillion rubles ($404 billion) between now and 2024 on major projects in 13 areas, including health, education and infrastructure. In the reshuffle, Andrei Belousov, Putin's economic adviser since 2013 and a key architect of the spending plans, was appointed first deputy prime minister, replacing Finance Minister Anton Siluanov who had held that role since May 2018. Maxim Reshetnikov, a former regional governor, was appointed Russia's new economy minister, replacing Maxim Oreshkin.  Putin, 67, is due to step down as president in 2024, though many say a proposed constitutional shake-up he is pushing through at the moment is designed to allow him to continue wielding influence in another role.     Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's prime minister since 2012, had been in charge of implementing the economic plan until Putin abruptly replaced him last week with former tax chief Mikhail Mishustin. “Putin could see (Medvedev) wasn't doing anything, it was infuriating that he was just sitting and waiting for the presidency to fall to him again,” said one of the sources who regularly meets Russian officials.  Medvedev served as Russia's president from 2008 to 2012 as the constitution barred Putin for a third consecutive term. Putin had grown unhappy with Medvedev's failure to deliver at a time when falling real wages and declining government popularity risked deepening public anger, another source close to the government said. The second source said Putin was concerned about the impact of falling living standards and a plan to hike the pension age, and wanted a visible reboot to assuage public anxiety and speed up the roll-out of his national projects.   “We need to realize the national projects more actively so that people feel changes to their lives and around them soon,” Mishustin, Putin's new prime minister, told his cabinet at their first meeting on Tuesday. However, the promotion of Belousov, who has a reputation as a proponent of state capitalism, is causing concern among some investors. His appointment “implies a shift from the economic agenda and tight fiscal policy to spending and the National Projects,” Alfa Bank said in a note to clients.  Higher state spending could create inflationary risks, which will limit room for further rate cuts by the central bank while wiping out Russia's budget surplus. In the old set-up, Finance Minister Siluanov had been crucial in implementing a prudent fiscal policy, known as the budget rule, designed to shield the economy from swings in the price of oil. But his demotion and Belousov's elevation open the door to possible change.        “The appointment of Belousov raises concerns about a softening of fiscal policy,” said Kirill Tremasov, a former economy ministry official who heads research at Locko Invest firm. However, Moody's credit rating agency said Russia would be able to cope with higher state spending, given its low public debt and the rebuilding of fiscal reserves following the implementation of its fiscal rule in 2018 and some spending under-execution in recent years.

The U.S. government added Sudan to its list of state sponsors of terrorism in 1993 over allegations that then-President Omar al-Bashir's Islamist government was supporting terrorist groups. The designation makes Sudan technically ineligible for debt relief and financing from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Congress needs to approve a removal.  Bashir was toppled by the military last year. A civilian transitional government, formed in August, agreed with the United States that it could start engaging with international institutions while still on the list. Saudi Arabia supported the overthrow of Bashir, in what analysts believed reflected its coordinated efforts with the United Arab Emirates to curtail the regional influence of the Muslim Brotherhood, who backed his regime.

'No dollars today': Exchanges resist Lebanon's push to steady currency,Jan 22 2020,"BEIRUT () - A push by Lebanon to rein in a thriving parallel market for dollars and halt the slide of its slumping pound hit a snag on Wednesday when currency dealers largely refused to sell at a new, lower price agreed with the central bank. Lebanon is in the throes of a deep economic crisis that has prompted banks fearing capital flight to put stiff controls on dollars, forcing everyone from major importers to average Lebanese to turn to exchange bureaus to meet their needs. Since mass protests against the country's elite erupted in October, the dollar price on this parallel market has soared, hitting as high as 2,500 pounds to the dollar versus an official rate of 1,507.5 in place since 1997, hiking prices. Lebanon is hoping a new government formed on Tuesday will restore confidence to secure urgently needed foreign funds and  stabilize its currency and banks. Looking to stem the currency's fall, Lebanon's union of exchange dealers said shortly before the cabinet was announced that it agreed with the central bank to set a maximum buying price of 2,000 Lebanese pounds to the dollar. It said violators would be subject to unspecified “legal and administrative” penalties. On Wednesday, dollars once easily attained at Beirut's buzzing exchanges were elusive, potentially posing a new challenge for Lebanese hit by the worst financial strains since a 1975-1990 civil war. Eight of 10 currency bureaus visited by  said they did not have dollars for sale but were willing to purchase dollars at the new price of 2,000 Lebanese pounds. Several customers were seen selling dollars at the new rate. Other dealers said the price control would force the market underground, pushing transactions outside exchange bureaus. “It is going to create a third market, a parallel market to the parallel market. It is not very realistic,” said a second dealer. While two bureaus in Beirut's Hamra district were selling small quantities of dollars to customers at rates of 2,050 and 2,075, while buying at 2,000, five others were turning customers away with a terse: “No dollars today.” Some dealers said the snap decision to impose a price ceiling meant the dollars they purchased a day earlier at a higher rate of 2,170-2,180 pounds would leave them with losses. “No one is selling today because we are trying to gather dollars at 2,000 to sell them,” said one dealer. “The price has to come down before we can sell at around 2,000,” he said. New finance minister Ghazi Wazni threw cold water on hopes the pound could return to pre-crisis levels, telling local broadcaster LBC “it is impossible for the dollar to return to what it was before” on the parallel market. Central bank governor Riad Salameh has insisted import-dependent Lebanon will stick by the peg, citing the need to keep in check the price of staple goods like fuel.

UPDATE 1-Warren calls on big U.S. banks to disclose preparation for climate risk,Jan 22 2020,"(Adds link to Warren's letter) By Ann Saphir and Lindsay Dunsmuir SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON, Jan 22 () - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a contender for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, is asking the biggest U.S. banks for details on their assessments of and preparations for risks related to global warming. “To protect themselves and the economy from climate-driven catastrophes, large financial institutions must act quickly to address risks,” Warren, a frequent critic of big banks, said in letters sent on Tuesday to top executives at Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, State Street and Wells Fargo. “I write to ask for more information about the risks caused by the climate crisis on the financial industry and your institution's practices, including what steps, if any, your institution is taking to adapt to mitigate these risks,” she said in the letters warren-big-bank-letters.pdf, provided to . She asked for detailed written responses by Feb. 7. Over the past year a surge in natural disasters caused or exacerbated by warming temperatures, including bushfires in Australia, have driven climate change up the political agenda around the world and sparked protests demanding action. The threat has caught the attention of financial regulators concerned with how rising seas and other consequences of the build-up of human-generated greenhouse gases could impact financial stability by, for instance, eroding the value of homes against which banks have lent hundreds of billions of dollars. Regulators are also focused on assessing the potential impact of political responses to climate change on bank profitability and even viability, even as the world's largest banks are increasingly targeted by activists for providing funding to fossil-fuel intensive industries, a major contributor to global warming. Led by the Bank of England, dozens of central banks have called for better disclosure of risks related to climate change and have begun mapping out approaches to banking sector supervision that take such risks into account. At its first-ever conference on climate change and economics last November, the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled it too may look at how to incorporate climate change risk into its assessments of financial stability. A panel convened by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission has begun its own effort to examine climate threats to the financial system. But overall, U.S. financial regulators lag their peers abroad. The current Republican U.S. administration has played down research on the risks of global warming and rolled back regulations designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions. On Tuesday, at the World Economic Forum in Davos where environmental issues have taken center stage, President Donald Trump dismissed those worried by climate change as “perennial prophets of doom.” Warren is among a group of leading Democrats vying for the party's nomination to take on Trump in the November contest for U.S. president, but trails former Vice President Joe Biden and fellow U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in most opinion polls. All three are in favor of more government action to reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to limit impacts on the U.S. economy. Warren last year was a co-signer of a bill that would direct the Fed to “stress test” banks' resilience to climate-related financial risks. In her letter, Warren asked the banks for details on how the proposed legislation would affect their operations as well as investments in oil companies, and whether they would support such a law. She also asked whether they formally assess climate-related risks and what changes they may have made in response. “As climate change continues to affect our economy, it is critical to understand your bank's adaptation and mitigation strategies,” Warren wrote. Many large U.S. banks, including those receiving Warren's letter, acknowledge that climate change poses a business risk and some make some disclosures about their own climate-related risks in line with recommendations from the international Financial Stability Board.  asked each bank for comment on Warren's letter after normal business hours. A JPMorgan spokesman said the bank was reviewing the letter. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman pointed to the environmental sustainability section of its website, which touts its financing of clean technology and environmental education.

Whatever the weather: Southern Africa tries new hunger fixes,Jan 22 2020,"JOHANNESBURG (Thomson  Foundation) - From drone-mapping in Mozambique to community radio weather programmes in Zambia, aid agencies are innovating to help millions of people in drought-ravaged southern Africa prepare for climate threats and produce enough food on a warming planet.  Across the region, a record 45 million people face growing levels of hunger due to repeated drought, widespread floods, lost harvests and an economic crisis in Zimbabwe, the World Food Programme (WFP) said last week. A business-as-usual approach to providing aid will no longer do, humanitarian officials said. “We cannot see food insecurity through an emergency lens alone,” said Michael Charles, head of the southern African office for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). “We will always be chasing shadows if we don't take a step back, go back to the drawing board, and work as a collective on long-term solutions with more impact,” he added. Failing to do so would be “devastating”, he told the Thomson  Foundation. Over the past year, much of the central and western parts of southern Africa have experienced their lowest rainfall since 1981, according to the United Nations.  Lola Castro, WFP's director for the region, told journalists last week a “silent catastrophe” was playing out. The humanitarian innovation required to address it includes the use of new technology like drones but also simple solutions that deploy limited resources effectively, said Bettina Koelle, a researcher with the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre. “Aid groups need to engage in constant dialogue with those most affected by climate shocks to understand what it is they need,” she said. “There are no quick fixes.”    Jesse Mason, an atmospheric scientist with WFP, and his team use long-term meteorological forecasts to predict weather patterns up to six months ahead and to finance humanitarian responses upfront.  Bringing these projections to government, donors and farmers can stop “the vicious cycle” of responding to climate shocks and redirect energy to better preparation, Mason said. Zambia's government, meanwhile, has partnered with the United Nations Development Programme on a seven-year project aimed at safeguarding farmers' incomes against climate threats. Using community radio broadcasts in local languages, forecasts are announced every hour to reflect erratic weather patterns, and tips provided on “climate-smart” agriculture. So far 170,000 small-scale farmers across 16 districts have been involved in the project, some via extension officers on motorcycles who bring new information directly to them.  In Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi, insurance schemes for 140,000 rural households have been rolled out by the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Co-operation (CTA), which is backed by African, Caribbean, Pacific and European states. Farmers sign up via their mobile phones, with low rainfall measurements triggering payouts they can use to purchase new seeds to replace crops destroyed by drought. “People are tired of hearing about climate problems,” said Oluyede Ajayi, a senior programme coordinator for the CTA.  “We need solutions - especially farmers whose families, livestock and livelihoods depend on them.”  The unpredictability of climate change makes data and information from the ground even more valuable, said Koelle. WFP has used drones to map vulnerable parts of Mozambique and Madagascar ahead of the upcoming cyclone season so they know where people are and how to get aid in, said Castro. “Drones will be used for the first time to help in search and rescue operations, to identify people stuck in trees so helicopters can come and pick them up,” she added.  This is much cheaper than using helicopters for the initial search, she noted.  U.N. children's agency UNICEF has said drones hold great promise for delivering medical supplies to rural areas and responding to disasters like earthquakes and floods, with their potential being explored from Namibia to Kazakhstan. WFP is also working with farmers to improve post-harvest storage facilities, providing people with food vouchers to spend locally rather than bringing in supplies, and encouraging people to switch to more drought-resistant crops. Innovations are also being tested in other parts of Africa. Global aid group Action Against Hunger, for example, has created a “Pastoral Early Warning System” that uses satellite data to track drought and anticipate risks by measuring plant growth and surface water in the semi-arid Sahel, which skirts the Sahara desert. Koelle highlighted the need to consider where the limits to adaptation might lie. Where they are crossed, it might be necessary to put in place social welfare programmes, such as cash transfers for women-headed households, to ease suffering. Protecting people's consumer choices is another important part of climate resilience, said the IFRC's Charles.  Ensuring farmers have good links to markets to sell their harvests will help maintain their livelihoods and give them “choices about how they want to use their money”, he added.  “This gives people dignity and space to thrive, and to break out of the cycle of food insecurity”, he explained. For now, as southern Africa approaches the “lean” season - the period between planting and harvesting - aid groups are bracing for a tough few months. “We need to learn from what has happened already,” said Charles. “No single entity can fight climate change - we need resilience as a collective to get through this.” (This story refiles to fix acronym in para 29) ","{'neg': 0.078, 'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': 0.9742}",0.9742
U.S. existing home sales surge to near two-year high,Jan 22 2020,"WASHINGTON, Jan 22 () - U.S. home sales jumped to their highest level in nearly two years in December, the latest indication that lower mortgage rates are helping the housing market to regain its footing after hitting a soft patch in 2018. The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday that existing home sales increased 3.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million units last month, the highest level since February 2018. November's sales pace was unrevised at 5.35 million units. Economists polled by  had forecast existing home sales would increase 1.3% to a rate of 5.43 million units in December. Last month, existing home sales rose in the Northeast, West and the populous South. But sales fell in the Midwest. Existing home sales, which make up about 90% of U.S. home sales, surged 10.0% on a year-on-year basis in December. For all of 2019, sales were unchanged at 5.34 million units. The report came on the heels of government data last week showing homebuilding surged to a 13-year high in December. The housing market is being supported by cheaper mortgage rates after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times last year. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to an average of 3.65% from its peak of 4.94% in November 2018, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. But the sector, which accounts for about 3.1% of gross domestic product, remains constrained by a lack of homes, especially in the lower-price segment of the market, because of land and labor shortages. There were a record-low 1.40 million previously owned homes on the market in December, down 14.6% from November and 8.5% from a year ago. The median existing house price soared 7.8% from a year ago, the most since January 2016, to $274,500 in December. House prices increased 4.8% in 2019.

"South African Airways should be saved, says ruling ANC",Jan 22 2020,"JOHANNESBURG () - Heavily-indebted South African Airways (SAA) should be retained as a national airline but needs substantial restructuring, a top official in the governing African National Congress (ANC) party said on Wednesday. SAA is running out of cash after the government failed to provide 2 billion rand ($138 million) of emergency funding it promised when the airline entered a form of bankruptcy protection last month. Government officials say they still want to give SAA the promised funds, but Finance Minister Tito Mboweni is insisting the transfer be done in a way that avoids increasing the country's budget deficit. Time is running out for potential options that include the sale of state assets. “SAA should be retained as a national airline, which will require substantial restructuring. The Cabinet should take the operational decisions needed to achieve this,” ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule told reporters. Magashule, one of the ANC's top six officials, was among those who attended a four-day meeting of ANC leaders to debate the economy and struggling state firms that ended on Monday.  SAA is among several South African state entities, including power company Eskom, that are mired in financial crisis after nearly a decade of mismanagement. State companies' financial problems are seen as one of the biggest threats to Africa's most industrialized economy and have helped to push the country's credit rating to the brink of junk status. On Tuesday, SAA said it had canceled more than 20 domestic flights between its Johannesburg hub and Cape Town and Durban this week, and 10 international flights to and from Munich, to save dwindling cash reserves. The airline has not made a profit since 2011 and has received more than 20 billion rand in bailouts over the last three years. Last year the government's patience ran out. Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan allowed SAA to enter “business rescue,” a bankruptcy protection process that shields the airline from creditors' demands while an independent adviser takes over. Since then, SAA has burned through 2 billion rand of funds from lenders. Finance Minister Mboweni told state broadcaster SABC in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos that officials from his ministry were “working feverishly” to secure the extra 2 billion rand SAA urgently needs. “It's very important that happens in a fiscally-neutral way because we don't have an appropriations bill that can find an additional 2 billion rand,” he said. “We will try to support SAA as much as we can.” ","{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.832, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': 0.3358}",0.3358

IMF seen as option for Lebanon depending on terms: senior politician,Jan 22 2020,"BEIRUT () - An International Monetary Fund program is an option for Lebanon depending on terms that should be bearable for the crisis-hit country and not trigger social unrest, a senior politician said on Wednesday as a new government took office. The question of whether Lebanon should engage the IMF is seen as one of the most pressing decisions facing the cabinet, which must urgently draw up a rescue plan to address a financial and economic emergency as protests turn violent. After months without effective government, Lebanon finally formed a government on Tuesday with backing from the powerful Shi'ite Muslim group Hezbollah and allies, including the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) founded by President Michel Aoun. New Prime Minister Hassan Diab's cabinet is made up of technocratic figures selected by groups including Hezbollah, the FPM and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri's Amal Movement.  The FPM nominated six of the 20 ministers. “The top priority is to put in place a rescue program for financing Lebanon's needs and one of the options is an IMF program,” Alain Aoun, a senior FPM politician, told . “But we have to understand first what are the requirements and to see if they are bearable or acceptable to us as Lebanese, because we don't want to have a social problem in addition to the financial crisis. “We have to be careful not to trigger social unrest,” he added. “But we definitely need international assistance to finance our spending needs in the public and private sector.” The absence of a government had left Lebanon rudderless with ordinary people suffering in a crisis whose root causes include decades of state corruption and bad governance that have landed Lebanon with one of the world's heaviest public debt burdens. A liquidity crunch has led banks to restrict access to cash and caused the Lebanese pound to slump. Jobs have been lost and inflation has soared. Over the last week, hundreds have been injured in clashes between security forces and demonstrators. New Finance Minister Ghazi Wazni said on Tuesday Lebanon needed foreign aid to save it from an unprecedented situation that had forced people to “beg for dollars” at the banks and fear for their deposits.

Main Irish opposition party would boost Rainy Day Fund,Jan 22 2020,"DUBLIN () - Ireland's main opposition party Fianna Fail, leading in opinion polls before a Feb. 8 election, will boost annual contributions to the state's Rainy Day Fund if elected in an attempt to further shield the treasury from potential future shocks. Ireland's Fine Gael-led government outlined plans for the contingency reserve in 2016 that was initially capitalized last year by transferring 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) from the country's sovereign wealth fund. Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe plans to supplement it with 500 million euros a year until it reaches a total of 8 billion euros, although he postponed the first contribution last year to instead set money aside for a possible chaotic Brexit. Fianna Fail's finance spokesman Michael McGrath said he would increase the annual deposits to 750 million euros to reach a total of 5.5 billion euros by the end of the next government's term in 2025, while continuing to grow a budget surplus in line with the finance department's projections.  “We will still run the same surplus on the government balance side, your net debt position remains unchanged but I think it will be an important reassurance for investors, those who buy government bonds to see that Ireland has very much learned its less and is putting money aside,” McGrath told a news conference on Wednesday. The Irish economy is forecast to grow by an average of 3% per year to 2025 but finance ministry officials assess risks to those estimates to be “highly skewed to the downside”, pointing to Brexit, a possible deeper global downturn and disruption to global trade. Ireland's finances returned to a small surplus for the first time in a decade in 2018 and is projected to rise to 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) by next year.

Sisay was not available for immediate comment on Wednesday. But he is on record saying the miner's debt to Orion and the depressed copper market made it unlikely that mining would continue at Tschudi in the foreseeable future. He was, however, optimistic that new investors could potentially come on board. “We are talking to several interested parties. They just need to understand the asset better, the ore body better.

The FPM nominated six of the 20 ministers. “The top priority is to put in place a rescue programme for financing Lebanon's needs and one of the options is an IMF programme,” Alain Aoun, a senior FPM politician, told . “But we have to understand first what are the requirements and to see if they are bearable or acceptable to us as Lebanese, because we don't want to have a social problem in addition to the financial crisis. “We have to be careful not to trigger social unrest,” he added. “But we definitely need international assistance to finance our spending needs in the public and private sector.” The absence of a government had left Lebanon rudderless with ordinary people suffering in a crisis whose root causes include decades of state corruption and bad governance that have landed Lebanon with one of the world's heaviest public debt burdens. A liquidity crunch has led banks to restrict access to cash and caused the Lebanese pound to slump. Jobs have been lost and inflation has soared. Over the last week, hundreds have been injured in clashes between security forces and demonstrators. ","{'neg': 0.117, 'neu': 0.808, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': -0.9458}",-0.9458

"Cambodian opposition leader admits U.S. funding, denies overthrow plot",Jan 22 2020,"PHNOM PENH () - Cambodia's opposition leader admitted in a 2013 video clip played in court on Wednesday to receiving funding and advice from unspecified Americans but denied trying to overthrow the government of strongman Prime Minister Hun Sen. Kem Sokha was arrested in 2017 and his party banned in a crackdown by Hun Sen on opposition, civil society groups and the media in the run-up to the 2018 parliamentary election, in which the ruling party won every seat. Sokha, 66, is on trial on charges of treason, accused of having conspired with the United States to topple Hun Sen. He denies the charges, calling them politically motivated. If convicted, Sokha would face up to 30 years in prison. Some reporters were allowed to view trial proceedings on Wednesday after being barred from sessions last week. In the video, which runs for over an hour and was submitted as evidence by Sokha himself, the defendant said he had received advice and financing from unidentified Americans to support ways of fostering democracy and human rights in Cambodia. “I rented a radio station, America let me rent a radio station...to educate people at the grassroots,” Sokha said in the video, citing a station owned by local former opposition politician Mam Sonando. “I...brought him $50,000 of U.S. money for him to set up the radio, making its signal stronger (so as to) air my speeches every day from public forums,” Sokha said. He denied any intent to seek change through violence in Cambodia, which suffered bloody upheaval in which some two million people died under the brutal Maoist Khmer Rouge regime during the 1970s. “Do we want Khmer blood to flow again? The answer is no, we don't want (that),” Sokha said in the video. “We, the National Rescue Party, absolutely do not use violence. Anyone who wants to use violence or force..., we do not do it because I regret Khmer blood, I do not want to do (that).” A spokesperson at U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Hun Sen himself is a former Khmer Rouge guerrilla who defected to the regime's eventual conquerors, Vietnam, and he has been in power since the mid-1980s. Hun Sen has cast his crackdown on opposition as vital to preserve law and order. Sokha's trial continues on Thursday.  ","{'neg': 0.173, 'neu': 0.73, 'pos': 0.098, 'compound': -0.9925}",-0.9925
Thailand's $105 billion budget faces further delay,Jan 22 2020,"BANGKOK () - Thailand's 3.2 trillion baht ($105.40 billion) budget for the current fiscal year, aimed at reviving a flagging economy, faces further delay as lawmakers seek a court ruling on the validity of the parliament vote to approve it. Parliament passed the draft bill, which was expected to be effective in early February, this month, delayed from Oct. 1, when the fiscal year began. The House of Representatives will now ask the Constitution Court to rule whether the vote was valid following the discovery that a lawmaker's voting card was used when the lawmaker was not present. “We will send this matter to the court tomorrow,” an official at the lower house told . The proposed budget foresees a 7% rise in overall spending to 3.2 trillion baht for the current fiscal year. It sets a deficit of 469 billion baht, up 4.2% from the 2019 fiscal year. On Wednesday, Finance Minister Uttama Savanayana told reporters that any further delay in the budget should not affect investor confidence. “If the budget is further delayed, the finance ministry's agencies will consider measures and other options,” he said. “Seeking a bill to borrow for investment is one option.” Southeast Asia's second-largest economy has lagged most regional peers for years. The central bank forecast economic growth of 2.8% this year, slightly picking up from an estimated 2.5% in 2019, a five-year low.

Credit Suisse says Mozambique liable for $622 million loan at heart of bribery scandal,Jan 22 2020,"JOHANNESBURG () - Credit Suisse () has hit back against Mozambique in a case in Britain's High Court, arguing a government guarantee for a $622 million loan - part of a $2 billion debt scandal - is valid and that it is entitled to claim damages.  Mozambique sued the investment bank last year, alongside a number of other defendants, in a bid to cancel the guarantee and seek compensation for losses related to the debt saga, which tipped its economy into crisis.  Credit Suisse rejected Mozambique's arguments in its defense papers and submitted a counter claim, dated Jan. 21, requesting the court declare the guarantee binding and arguing it is entitled to seek interest and damages, namely the money it says it is owed.   “The claims against CSI and CSLB are denied in their entirety,” the papers said, referring to Credit Suisse International and its London branch. “CSI and CSLB are not liable to pay any damages, compensation or indemnity.” Credit Suisse and Russia's VTB () bank provided or helped arrange financing, granted in 2013 and 2014, for a project spanning tuna fishing, maritime security and shipyard development, which U.S. authorities now say was an elaborate front for a bribery and kickback scheme. Hundreds of millions of dollars went missing.  Mozambique is trying to claim hefty sums that the country has paid or still owes under the agreements, which also included an $850 million eurobond, now restructured, and a $535 million loan from VTB (), as well as compensation for economic losses.  A series of court cases spanning three continents has ensnared three former Credit Suisse bankers, Mozambique's former finance minister and its former president's son. However, Mozambique's action against Credit Suisse is the only one to target the bank itself.  The country says Credit Suisse employees, and therefore the bank, knew that large bribes were being paid and that guarantees for the loans exceeded limits set out in law, or were wilfully blind to it.  Mozambique's Attorney General's Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  VTB earlier this month lodged its own lawsuit in Britain's High Court suing a Mozambique state-owned company over the $535 million loan. All of the lending for the project was guaranteed by Mozambique's government, though some of it was not disclosed. The International Monetary Fund and other donors cut off support to Mozambique when the additional borrowing came to light in 2016, triggering a currency collapse and debt default it is yet to fully recover from.

"Power cuts cost South Africa up to $8.3 bln in 2019, research shows",Jan 22 2020,"JOHANNESBURG, Jan 22 () - Power cuts by state utility Eskom cost the South African economy up to 120 billion rand ($8.3 billion) last year and will probably persist for the next two to three years, research by the country's national science council showed. The power cuts are one of the biggest challenges facing President Cyril Ramaphosa as he tries to revive investor confidence in Africa's most industrialised economy. Ramaphosa has promised to break up Eskom to make it more efficient and granted it a series of mammoth bailouts to stabilise its finances, but its coal-fired power plants keep breaking down after years of mismanagement. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) urged the government to move swiftly to ease regulations governing “self-generation” of electricity by companies and households as a way to minimise power cuts in 2020. Other government initiatives, such as giving independent power producers the go-ahead to build new plants, could only help reduce the scale of power cuts from 2021 if procurement processes are expedited or from 2022 under normal circumstances, the CSIR research showed. Ramaphosa promised in a speech to business leaders this month that he would embrace efforts by businesses and households to generate their own electricity, but his government is yet to follow through with the necessary regulatory reforms. The CSIR said the government should publish determinations to procure more power as soon as the first quarter of this year and talk to existing renewable energy producers about squeezing more electricity from their plants.

Hungarian banks renew call for tax easing as instant payment launch nears,Jan 22 2020,"BUDAPEST () - Hungarian banks say they have spent up to $133 million on a new instant-payments system and won't pass on the cost to customers, but are seeking to recoup part of it by asking the government to ease a financial transaction tax. Under the new system, due to launch on March 2 after several months of delays, domestic bank transfers worth up to 10 million forints ($33,050) will be settled within five seconds, seven days a week, as the banks respond to increased competition from fintech providers. Andras Becsei, chairman of the Hungarian Banking Association, said the project - at a total cost of 30-40 billion forints - was the biggest investment the lenders had ever made. “To make instant payments a success, it is important for local lenders not to be at a competitive disadvantage to foreign service providers,” he said, reiterating the banks' call for a tax on financial transactions to be repealed. Levente Kovacs, secretary general of the association, said banks had struck a gentlemen's agreement with the central bank that customers would not face increased charges to cover the cost of the new system.  But the association - including OTP Bank OTPB.BU and foreign players such as Austria's Raiffeisen (), Belgium's KBC Groep () and Italy's UniCredit () - said the government should reduce the annual tax by 10 billion forints ($33 million) to take account of their extra costs. The financial transaction tax is expected to raise 226 billion forints this year. The finance ministry did not immediately reply to a  request for comment.

"Lebanon should restructure Eurobonds, seek IMF help: ex-minister",Jan 22 2020,"BEIRUT () - Lebanon should restructure its Eurobonds, including a $1.2 billion issue maturing in March, and secure a multi-billion dollar IMF bailout to stave off economic meltdown, its former labor minister said. The country is deep in financial crisis and struggling with one of the world's largest debt piles relative to GDP, and markets are focused on whether a new government formed on Tuesday will meet the March payment. “I don't see the logic of the system leaking $500 to $600 million out of Lebanon on the March payment when an actual restructuring of the Eurobonds is next to inevitable,” Camille Abousleiman told  in an interview. “That money would be better spent on other things, such as food and medicine.”  Abousleiman, who drafted the legal framework for Lebanon's bonds from the mid-1990s onwards, spoke on Tuesday while still caretaker labor minister. He is not part of the new government. Lebanon has never defaulted on its international debt but with its longer-dated bonds trading at less than half their face value, the market is already pricing in prospects of a default or restructuring.  The central bank mulled a proposal to ask local holders of some of this year's bonds to swap them for longer-dated ones to ease pressure on state finances. Former caretaker finance minister Ali Hassan Khalil asked it to hold off on that plan until the new government was formed.  “The size of the debt is too large relative to the size of the economy,” said Abousleiman, who said any restructuring of the debt could include an extension of the maturity or reduction in the interest rate, not necessarily the principal. Lebanon's gross public debt is around $89.5 billion, 38% of it in foreign currency.  Finance Minister Ghazi Wazni on Tuesday said the new government must decide on its approach to the Eurobond due in March and also needed foreign support to help ease economic and financial strains. Abousleiman said it was “inevitable” the new government would look to secure IMF support as there was no other way to get the “large liquidity” Lebanon needed. A deal of around $4 billion to $5 billion might ease the deficit, reassure bondholders and encourage other prospective international donors, while also giving momentum to economic and social reforms, he said. “This needs to be accompanied by a serious plan to combat corruption and return ill-gotten gains,” he said, referencing one of the root causes of widespread civil unrest.

"Tax avoidance, evasion costs EU 170 billion euros a year, says Poland",Jan 22 2020,"WARSAW () - European Union member states lose 170 billion euros ($188.38 billion) a year due to tax avoidance and evasion, a Polish state think-tank said in a report due to be discussed later on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos. The report, from the Polish Economic Institute, also proposed that the European Commission should have powers to sanction as “EU tax havens” countries that benefited from what it called artificial profit-shifting by companies.  “Losses resulting from the use of international transactions for tax fraud and tax avoidance reduce EU Member States' revenues by around 170 billion euros annually,” Piotr Arak, the director of the Polish Economic Institute, said in a statement. “The Union should take integrated measures to seal the tax system in order to have an additional source of financing for the new budget, to be constructed without the United Kingdom, a major payer,” the institute said. The report is to be discussed on Wednesday evening in Davos, with speakers including Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. The broader issue of tax has been high on the agenda at Davos, with a battle brewing between the United States and Europe over how the world's biggest technology firms are taxed. Out of 170 billion euros the EU loses every year 60 billion euros comes from artificial profit-shifting by multinational companies -  moving earnings from a higher tax jurisdiction to a country with a lower tax rate - 46 billion euros due to moving wealth by rich individuals, and 64 billion euros due to cross-border VAT fraud, the institute said. The countries worst-hit by losses due to artificial profit shifting were: Germany (18 billion euros), Britain (14 billion), and France (11 billion), it said. “Some EU Member States benefit from the artificial profit shifting process and should be called EU tax havens,” the report added. “These are: the Netherlands, Ireland, Belgium, Luxemburg, Malta and Cyprus.” Overall tax losses for EU countries over seven years add up to 1,190 billion euros, or a quarter more than the whole EU budget for 2014-2020 which amounts to 960 billion euros, the institute said. The Polish Economic Institute's remit is to supply the government with analysis to support its development plans for the country. Since 2015 Poland has been ruled by the Law and Justice (PiS) party and remains at loggerheads with the EU over judiciary reforms, rule of law, environment and migration policy.

"Russia gets new government in what Putin calls ""major renewal""",Jan 22 2020,"MOSCOW () - Russian President Vladimir Putin approved a new government on Tuesday which he described as a break with the past, bringing in some fresh faces but retaining many senior ministers.  The new government included a new economy minister and a new first deputy prime minister, but the finance, foreign, defense, energy and agriculture ministers all kept their jobs. The new team was formed less than a week after Putin unveiled a sweeping shake-up of the political system, which led to the resignation of his ally Dmitry Medvedev as prime minister along with the entire government. Putin went on to pick 53-year-old former tax chief Mikhail Mishustin, who has almost no political profile, as his new prime minister.  Putin's wider shake-up, which envisages changing the constitution, is widely seen as preparing the ground for 2024, when Putin, now 67, is obliged to leave the presidency after occupying the Kremlin or the prime minister's job continuously since 1999. Critics have long said Putin, a former KGB officer, wants to stay on in some capacity after his term ends so that he can wield power over the world's largest nation and one of its two biggest nuclear powers. Tuesday's new appointments could be intended to reboot the government's flagging image and shift attention to Putin's drive to lift falling real incomes and drive ahead with big national infrastructure projects which he hopes will catapult his country into a new economic league. “The most important task is to increase the welfare of our citizens and strengthen our statehood and the position of our country in the world. All these are absolutely attainable goals,” Putin told the new government. “We have achieved a very balanced government. We have enough people who worked in the previous government, as well as a major renewal.”      Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, Energy Minister Alexander Novak, Agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushev, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov all kept their jobs. Putin named Andrei Belousov, his economy advisor since 2013, as first deputy prime minister, replacing Anton Siluanov who had held the role since May 2018. Belousov, 60, in 2018 proposed making big metals and mining companies pay a windfall tax, sending their share prices lower, although that proposal was subsequently watered down.     Belousov also made headlines last year when he confirmed his friendship with businessman Artem Avetisyan, whose legal battle with private equity fund Baring Vostok has rattled the business community.     Putin approved 40-year-old Maxim Reshetnikov, a former regional governor, as the new economy minister, replacing Maxim Oreshkin who spent just over three years in the role. Reshetnikov has previously worked in the Moscow mayor's office. Putin also replaced the minister of telecommunications. He named Maksut Shadaev, until now a vice president of state telecoms operator Rostelecom, to the role.  Abbas Gallyamov, a former government speech writer, said Putin had removed three people strongly disliked in certain parts of society - the ministers for culture and education, and a deputy prime minister who oversaw sport at the height of a doping scandal. “Previously the Kremlin said it would appoint who it wanted and didn't care if people didn't like their choice,” Gallyamov wrote on social media. “Now the logic has changed and the authorities do not want to irritate society.” But he said keeping on some political heavyweights, signalled there was little change in direction, adding: “Putin is clearly showing that substantive changes to the regime's ideology are not planned.”  ","{'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.86, 'pos': 0.084, 'compound': 0.9467}",0.9467
Exclusive: Giuliani told U.S. his client deserves leniency for financing Venezuela's opposition - Parnas,Jan 22 2020,"WASHINGTON () - At a lavish August gathering at a private estate in Spain, a wealthy Venezuelan businessman under criminal investigation in the United States introduced Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, to the father of Venezuela's opposition leader, Juan Guaido. The affair was part of a campaign for leniency for the businessman, Alejandro Betancourt, who sought to demonstrate his close ties to opposition figures looking to oust Venezuela's socialist President Nicolas Maduro - a key objective of the Trump administration. Betancourt told Giuliani he secretly helped bankroll Guaido's efforts to take over the leadership of Venezuela, according to four people familiar with the situation, two of whom provided  details about the meeting in Spain. Betancourt hoped those bona fides would enable Giuliani, his lawyer, to persuade Trump's Justice Department to drop its probe of Betancourt in connection with a Florida money laundering and bribery case, the people said. A month later, at a meeting in Washington, D.C., Giuliani urged Justice Department prosecutors to go easy on Betancourt, according to a person with direct knowledge of the meeting, and Lev Parnas, a former Giuliani associate, who said Giuliani told him about it soon afterward. Parnas and the other person said Giuliani told prosecutors that Betancourt had provided assistance for Guaido's political efforts, and was therefore doing good work for the United States. This is the first time Parnas detailed his story about Betancourt, Giuliani and Venezuela. Giuliani declined to confirm meeting with U.S. prosecutors on Betancourt's behalf and wouldn't say whether the Venezuelan businessman is a client. “Lev Parnas has no right to be talking about that meeting,” Giuliani told  in a brief phone interview. “It was a confidential meeting - if it did happen.” “Lev Parnas's credibility is worth nothing,” Giuliani said. The Justice Department declined to comment. Betancourt and his attorney Frank Wohl did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  couldn't determine whether Betancourt did provide financing to the U.S.-backed opposition or if he was just claiming he did. Guaido and the main opposition political party, Popular Will, both denied receiving funding from Betancourt. Guaido was a member of Popular Will until he stepped back from it earlier this month. “I do not know Mr. Betancourt, there is no relationship,” Guaido told . “As such, that is not possible.” Wilmer Guaido, Guaido's father, denied meeting Betancourt in Spain. “I only support my son like the whole family against that criminal dictatorship but I have not met anyone,” he said. Giuliani's meeting with Betancourt at the Spanish estate, and his efforts to lobby the Justice Department on the businessman's behalf, were previously reported by the Washington Post.  is the first to report that Betancourt told Giuliani that he provided financial support for Venezuela's opposition, and that Giuliani touted that alleged assistance to U.S. prosecutors as a reason to remove the legal cloud dogging his client. The episode speaks to the complex roles that Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, has played in Washington since Trump took office in 2017. Giuliani frequently proclaims himself a business consultant and lawyer working on behalf of private clients. Yet he also enjoys extraordinary access to the halls of power as the president's unpaid personal attorney - work that has landed him at the center of Trump's impeachment trial. Any attempt by a Giuliani client to avoid possible prosecution by claiming to have been backing an American foreign policy objective - the toppling of Maduro in this case - could prove embarrassing to the administration. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Parnas played a key role in Giuliani's effort to dig up dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in Ukraine for Trump. Now under indictment for campaign finance violations, Parnas has been sharing information with Capitol Hill impeachment investigators, as well as the media, about the extent of the work he did for Giuliani. Betancourt said “he was backing Guaido financially,” Parnas told , and “was helping America with his cause.” Since January 2019, the United States and dozens of other countries have recognized Guaido as Venezuela's rightful president. But Maduro has remained firmly in power, much to the frustration of the Trump administration. Maduro's government cut off paychecks for opposition lawmakers in 2016 after the opposition took control of the National Assembly. Claims that Betancourt helped finance his country's opposition are potentially explosive in Venezuela, where the mogul forged a profitable relationship with the socialist government. Derwick Associates, his Caracas-based energy firm, obtained hundreds of millions of dollars in state contracts to build power plants under Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez, according to local media. In a statement to , the opposition Popular Will party said that “information about the supposed remittance of funds by Alejandro Betancourt to our political organization is not true.” The existence of the U.S. criminal probe of Betancourt was confirmed to  by a source familiar with the matter.  The Miami Herald reported last November that the investigation is linked to a large money laundering case in Miami, and that Betancourt is an unindicted co-conspirator listed, but not named, in legal records. The 2018 charges accused eight defendants of embezzling $1.2 billion from Venezuela's government-owned oil company PDVSA, then laundering it through schemes in Miami involving false real estate and security deals. A representative of Betancourt who declined to be identified said the magnate “didn't do anything and he has not been charged with any wrongdoing.” He also told  that the businessman had provided “very substantial” financial support to Venezuela's opposition. PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment. At the State Department, Elliott Abrams, the U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela, told  the administration is aware of the lack of transparency in the opposition's financing.  “We're concerned about who are all these people, and how did they make their money. And that is something we have raised with the opposition,” Abrams said. Asked whether Betancourt was one of those individuals of concern, Abrams said: “No comment on individual names.” He added that Giuliani had not been authorized to play any role in U.S. policy in Venezuela. Parnas said the August meeting at Betancourt's estate outside Madrid, and the presence of Guaido's father, were meant to demonstrate Betancourt's strong ties to Guaido and his support for U.S. interests in Venezuela. It was to show Giuliani “that Betancourt is a really important person for the cause and that he is helping America,” Parnas said. The lobbying took place in Washington the month after the Spain meeting. Giuliani met with Assistant U.S. Attorney General Brian Benczkowski, a Justice Department lawyer working on the case, and some other government lawyers, according to Parnas and the person with direct knowledge of that meeting. Department of Justice spokesman Peter Carr, who handles communications for Benczkowski, said the department declined to comment.  The person said Giuliani was there with two other Betancourt lawyers, and made his pitch that the prosecutors let Betancourt off the hook for the case in Florida. Giuliani first insisted there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute the case. He then moved to U.S. foreign policy, pointing to Betancourt's alleged support for Guaido. “This guy's been helping the United States,” the person with direct knowledge of the meeting said in describing Giuliani's reasoning. Giuliani argued that Betancourt was crucial to the survival of the Venezuelan opposition, and he urged the Justice Department lawyers to talk to Guaido themselves to corroborate his claims, the person said.

Turkish bank probe casts wide net over trading: sources,Jan 22 2020,"ANKARA/ISTANBUL () - Turkish competition officials made surprise visits to several private, state and foreign banks late on Friday to analyze computers as they opened a wide-ranging probe of trading in the financial sector, according to three bankers.  Turkey's Competition Authority told  on Tuesday it was conducting “preliminary research” into banks, as it regularly does in all sectors, adding it could not say more about the effort until the process is completed.  Turkish media reported on Friday that the competition authority, which is part of the Ministry of Trade, was investigating possible violations in foreign-exchange, deposit, credit and brokerage services.  Two Turkish broadcasters have said that more than 20 banks are involved. Bankers said it was unclear exactly what the competition officials were investigating.  One banker said officials fanned out across Istanbul and simultaneously entered the lenders late on Friday afternoon. They sat down at trading desks to analyze computers, and requested more transaction information that is due this week, the person said. “The investigation that started on Friday was a surprise to us,” said a second banker, who also requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject.  The competition authority was not working with the BDDK banking regulator, which usually does such audits and would have access to some of the information being sought, the second banker said.  “This is why it raises question marks since we don't exactly know what they are looking for,” the person said. “All operations by banks are being investigated.” The government has clamped down on financial markets with a series of new rules and regulations since a currency crisis in 2018 knocked nearly 30% off the value of the Turkish lira.  The changes - including curbs on foreign-exchange and reserve requirements meant to boost lending - were meant to stabilize the currency and kick-start a recovery from recession.  In 2013, the competition authority fined 12 banks a total of 1.1 billion lira ($620 million at that time) for collusion on interest rates. In 2017, it probed 13 banks over corporate loans. A senior banker said the latest investigation was routine, while Finance Minister Berat Albayrak was quoted as saying on Monday he had heard about the investigation from the sector. “There is nothing to be concerned about,” Albayrak was quoted as telling local reporters.

The Greta and Trump show - Davos highlights on Tuesday,Jan 22 2020,"DAVOS, Switzerland () - The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) kicked off on Tuesday in the ski town of Davos.  Here are the highlights from Day 1: Greta Thunberg and U.S. President Donald Trump dominated as they both attempted to frame arguments around climate change. Speaking thousand miles away from where his impeachment trial was due to start, Trump backed a tree planting initiative and dismissed the “perennial prophets of doom” on climate change. Trump did not name Thunberg, but she was sitting in the audience and responded less than an hour later in a packed auditorium. “Our house is still on fire,” Thunberg said, repeating her warning at the WEF meeting a year ago. “Your inaction is fuelling the flames,” the 17-year-old added, in the latest to-and-fro with the 73-year-old president. Often seen as the preserve of rich, old men, this year's Davos has been invigorated by fresh voices, energy and Doc Martens with many young activists following their role model Thunberg up the Alps. The first panel of the four-day gathering made clear the shift, with a combined age of 64, much younger than the WEF's 81-year-old founder Klaus Schwab. Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam and “Team HK”, including its trade secretary, top officials from the stock exchange, airport authority, MTR Corp and the head of Swire Group, are on a mission to reassure after a Moody's downgrade this week. Lam sought to convince global business and political leaders that the Asian financial hub is open for business.  Apple chief executive Tim Cook will attend a breakfast meeting with Trump on Wednesday. On Tuesday evening Trump was to dine with several CEOs in a meeting organized with the help of Trump's adviser and daughter, Ivanka Trump, a source familiar with the situation said. Saudi finance minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told  on the sidelines of Davos that the proceeds of last month's listing of oil giant Saudi Aramco would be pumped into the local economy over several years, including building up defense systems. With nearly $30 billion coming from Aramco's local share offering last month, new and existing local industries, including defense and technology, will get a boost, Jadaan said.

World needs to prepare for 'millions' of climate displaced: U.N.,Jan 21 2020,"DAVOS, Switzerland () - The world needs to prepare for millions of people being driven from their homes by the impact of climate change, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said on Tuesday. Speaking to  at the World Economic Forum, Filippo Grandi said a U.N. ruling this week meant those fleeing as a result of climate change deserved international protection, and that it had broad implications for governments. The U.N. Human Rights Committee made the landmark ruling on Monday in relation to Ioane Teitiota, from the Pacific nation of Kiribati, who brought a case against New Zealand after authorities denied his claim of asylum. “The ruling says if you have an immediate threat to your life due to climate change, due to the climate emergency, and if you cross the border and go to another country, you should not be sent back, because you would be at risk of your life, just like in a war or in a situation of persecution,” Grandi said. “We must be prepared for a large surge of people moving against their will,” he said. “I wouldn't venture to talk about specific numbers, it's too speculative, but certainly we're talking about millions here.” Potential drivers include wildfires like those seen in Australia, rising sea levels affecting low-lying islands, the destruction of crops and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa and floods worldwide, not least in parts of the developed world. Whereas for most of its 70 years UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, has worked to assist those fleeing poorer countries as a result of conflict, climate change is more indiscriminate. “It is further proof that refugee movements and the broader issue of migration of populations ... is a global challenge that cannot be confined to a few countries,” said Grandi. Yet the convention relating to the status of refugees, signed in 1951, made no provision for climate change as a reason for people to flee their country and seek asylum elsewhere. As climate impacts grow, legal questions become more complicated. UNHCR, whose budget has risen from $1 billion a year in the early 1990s to $8.6 billion in 2019 as conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria have forced civilians to flee, now assists more than 70 million forcibly displaced people. Turkey is the largest recipient, with more than 4 million refugees and asylum seekers, the vast majority from Syria. That has strained Turkey's public finances and led President Tayyip Erdogan to demand more assistance from Europe. Last November, Erdogan threatened to open the door for Syrian refugees to head to Europe unless the European Union stepped up, and he is now calling for the “resettlement” of up to 1 million Syrians in the north of their homeland. Grandi said European governments needed to think hard about solutions to the migrant crisis, which has affected them since 2015, but also show more understanding of Turkey's situation. “We must recognise that, for the past several years (Turkey)has been hosting the largest refugee population in the world,” he said. “There's a lot of political talk. I concentrate on the substance of this, which is ‘let's strengthen Turkey's ability to host refugees until they can go back safely, voluntarily to their countries'.” ","{'neg': 0.085, 'neu': 0.863, 'pos': 0.052, 'compound': -0.9674}",-0.9674

"BlackRock, partners eye initial $500 million for climate fund",Jan 22 2020,"LONDON () - A BlackRock-backed () group aims to raise an initial $500 million for a private equity fund that will invest in climate change-linked infrastructure upgrades in emerging markets. The group will provide the first $100 million of funding for the Climate Finance Partnership (CFP), which was set up in 2018 along with France, Germany and the Hewlett and Grantham charitable foundations, it said in a statement on Wednesday. The funding will go toward a first-loss tranche that will absorb any initial losses, a safety net for other institutional investors that BlackRock expects to help it raise at least another $400 million.  The CFP fund will be invested in renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy storage solutions and ultra-low and electric transport. At least a quarter of the investments would be made in Africa, with the rest in selected countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America, BlackRock said. The venture is part of a wide-ranging overhaul of the way BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, is responding to the issue of climate change, as part of a broader commitment to environmental, social and governance-related investing. Climate has also been at the forefront of this year's annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, at which news of the planned initial fund-raising was announced. Finding novel ways to encourage accelerated investments has been a theme at Davos, and on Wednesday a separate $500 million United Nations-backed initiative also announced a plan to help achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, ‘SDG500'. The money raised will target businesses in the agriculture, finance, energy, education and healthcare sectors across many of the regions worst-hit by climate change. As with the CFP fund, the coalition of private and public sector organizations will also provide a first-loss layer for those investing in the project, which will provide exposure to six funds managed by asset manager Bamboo Partners.  In a recent annual letter to the thousands of companies in which BlackRock holds stakes, Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said the need to act on climate was “particularly urgent” given many cities were not built to withstand “the new climate reality”. France and Germany will both invest $30 million of the initial funding, while the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental Trust have pledged $10 million and $7.5 million, respectively. The CFP members have pledged to help raise the additional seed capital for the fund. BlackRock will also provide an as yet undetermined amount.

The retailer, which also runs Checkers and Usave chains in its home market, has managed to shrug off high levels of unemployment, rising living costs and slow growth in South Africa that have hurt many consumer-focused firms. It said it had grown its total sale of merchandise by 7% to 81.2 billion rand ($5.62 billion) in the six months to Dec. 29, with its South African supermarkets business growing sales by 9.8%. “All three supermarket brands... traded well in a tough market,” it said in an operational update, adding that its liquor business had also grown sales by 20.5%. Its shops outside of South Africa however continued to be hurt by currency devaluations and volatility in markets like Angola, Zambia and Nigeria, and as a result its non-South African business reported a 3.1% decline in sales. Sales in its furniture division also dropped by 2.7% following store closures and, it said, scheduled power cuts by South Africa's ailing power utility Eskom, which is struggling to keep the lights on amid severe financial woes.

The Dutch businessman on a mission to unite companies over climate change,Jan 22 2020,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Thomson  Foundation) - While global leaders take to the stage at Davos in the Swiss Alps, one of the world's most prominent businessmen is busy behind the scenes - trying to bring together the heads of major companies to tackle climate change and inequality. Paul Polman became known as a leading voice on sustainable capitalism while running consumer goods giant Unilever for 10 years and is a regular at the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting for the global elite in the up-market ski resort. Since retiring from Unilever a year ago, Polman has set his sights on using his sway among business chiefs, governments, finance and civil society to get them to work together on climate change and making economies fairer for everyone. “If you can bring about 25% of the industry together across the value chain, you can create tipping points, and that accelerates things,” Dutch businessman Polman, 63, told the Thomson  Foundation in an interview at a Davos hotel. His new sustainability consultancy, Imagine, set up last year, scored a major victory by organizing a fashion industry pact to announce at the G7 summit in France in August. The pact involves 62 major fashion companies striving to use sustainable cotton, cut out single-use plastics, and align their business with the Paris climate pact to address global warming. Now Polman wants to convene similar agreements in the food and land sector, tourism and travel, technology and finance, saying these companies had the biggest impact on the United Nations' global goals to address inequality and climate change. He was optimistic an agreement was achievable fairly quickly in the food industry where he is already well connected as chairman of the Food and Land Use Coalition. “They all want to be part of it ... six months from now we'll have a substantial group in the food sector,” he said. Polman said leaving Unilever gave him greater influence. “As a CEO you had shackles around your legs,” said Polman, who has taken a leading role on a powerful list of bodies including chair of the International Chamber of Commerce. With global challenges growing, governments could not be relied on, he said, adding that chief executives were starting to step up with bolder initiatives. He cited Microsoft's pledge to go carbon-negative by 2050 by removing carbon it has emitted over the past 45 years, and asset manager BlackRock saying it will stop investing in companies with a “high sustainability-related risk”. “Things are happening at a faster pace than perhaps people think, but the multilateral process is difficult,” he said. He pointed to disappointment over the recent COP25 climate talks, deforestation rising in Brazil under President Jair Bolsonaro, the U.S. administration quitting the Paris pact, and the Australian government's reaction over bushfires and climate change. But there was greater awareness at Davos this year about the need to act, including a commitment to plant one trillion trees to curb climate-heating emissions, he said. “The initiatives are becoming bigger and bolder. Is this enough? No, because you cannot change the world without governments' buy-in,” he added. ","{'neg': 0.02, 'neu': 0.907, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.9418}",0.9418
Women lose ground in German finance supervisory boards,Jan 22 2020,"FRANKFURT () - Women's representation on supervisory boards in Germany's finance sector slipped in 2019, lagging other industries in gender balance, according to a study on Wednesday. Women held 22.8% of supervisory board seats at banks and 22.2% of those at insurance companies, down from 23.2% and 22.5% respectively the year before, according to the study by the German Institute for Economic Research, or DIW. The decline contrasts with other industries, where women had an overall 28.2% share of seats, an improvement on the previous year's 26.9, DIW said. “It is striking that the financial sector is lagging behind,” Katharina Wrohlich, one of the authors, said in the report. Female representation on management boards rose slightly to 9.8% among banks and 11% among insurers, up from 8.7% and 9.6% respectively. Women hold 10.4% of management board seats in non-financial industries. DIW said that a reason for the discrepancy is that people in the financial sector, more so than in other industries, are disproportionately rewarded for working extremely long and inflexible hours, something that benefits men. In general across various industries, Germany fares better than the European Union average, according to DIW, but is well behind countries like France and Sweden. Some German companies have set targets to improve female representation. The online retailer Zalando (), for example, in October announced that by 2023 women should make up at least 40% of top positions, including on its supervisory and management board.

"Powered by SUVs, Hyundai turns in best quarter since early 2017",Jan 22 2020,"SEOUL () - Hyundai Motor Co () turned in its best quarterly operating profit in over two years and said it was on track for higher profit margins in 2020, powered by more sales of sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) such as the Palisade and Kona. The better-than-expected operating earnings, which fueled a rise in shares, indicates measures by Hyundai Motor Group heir-apparent Euisun Chung to revamp the image of the automaker known for its sedan-heavy lineup were beginning to pay off. So while overall vehicle sales for the South Korean company held mostly steady on year over October-December, its bottom line benefited as high-margin SUVs accounted for more of the sales mix - 42% versus 37% a year earlier. Hyundai said it would meet its target for a 5% operating profit margin this year, versus 3.5% in 2019, by selling even more SUVs and launching fully redesigned versions of some of its best-selling models, the Elantra sedan and the Tucson SUV. “We understand that achieving this year's operating profit margin of 5% is more important than ever,” Kim Sang-hyun, head of finance and accounting division, said on an earnings call. “The company views this year as the first to fully establish a virtuous sales cycle by optimizing supplies, profits and strengthening brand competitiveness,” Kim said.  “We will do our best to secure a sustainable revenue base in a difficult business environment.”  Sales for Hyundai and affiliate Kia Motors () hit a seven-year low in 2019 as business in China slumped, missing their target for a fifth time, but they have forecast better numbers for this year. Hyundai expects SUVs to account for about 43% of its sales in 2020, helped by the launch of a new premium Genesis brand SUV in the second half, in addition to the GV80 launched  last week.  “The market has been skeptical of the 5% profit margin target, but the target seems to be achievable thanks to new Genesis models,” said Lee Jae-il, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities.  While Hyundai is seeing a recovery in U.S. sales, thanks to demand for new SUVs and a favorable currency exchange rate, its business in China continues to suffer amid a broader slowdown in the world's biggest auto market. Its passenger car sales in China fell 4.8% on year in 2019. Hyundai, however, expects its wholesale vehicle sales in China to reach 730,000 this year from 650,000 vehicles in 2019. It also said it was looking for the best time to launch its premium Genesis brand in China and Europe. For October-December, Hyundai's operating profit was 1.24 trillion won ($1 billion), highest since the second quarter of 2017. It was more than analysts' average estimate of 1.06 trillion won, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data.  Hyundai shares closed up 8.6%, versus a 1.2% rise in the wider KOSPI .

"UK government borrows less than expected in December, but corporate tax take weakens",Jan 22 2020,"LONDON, Jan 22 () - Britain's government borrowed less than expected in December but there were signs the economy's weakness was hurting corporate tax receipts, while a pay rise for health workers pushed up spending. Borrowing excluding public sector-owned banks in December alone fell slightly compared with a year earlier to 4.765 billion pounds, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday. A  poll of economists had pointed to borrowing of 5.3 billion pounds. Despite the better-than-expected figure for December, borrowing in the first nine months of the financial year stood at 54.6 billion pounds, 7.9% higher than it was for April-December 2018. The data showed corporate tax receipts for the financial year to date, April to December, were 3.4% lower than at the same point a year ago, the sharpest annual drop since the same period of the 2012/13 financial year. On the expenditure side, other current spending was up 5.0% in the financial year to date compared with the same period in 2018/19, a record increase that reflects a pay rise for health workers authorized by former prime minister Theresa May. After nearly a decade of austerity when the budget deficit fell from 10% of national income to under 2%, Britain's Conservative government began last year to loosen the purse-strings, spending more on health care and public-sector pay. Finance minister Sajid Javid has announced the biggest increase in day-to-day spending in 15 years for the next financial year and has promised to use public investment to help voters in under-performing regions who gave Prime Minister Boris Johnson a thumping election win last month. Javid will deliver Britain's first post-Brexit budget plan on March 11. Despite his promises of more funding, especially for infrastructure, Javid has set himself a rule of eliminating the deficit in day-to-day spending within three years which will restrict how much more he can spend on public services. The ONS said public-sector net debt totaled 80.8% of GDP in December, excluding public-sector banks, or 73.0% once the effect of a temporary Bank of England lending scheme was stripped out.

TIMELINE-Ted Baker's tale of management and accounting woes,Jan 22 2020,"Jan 22 () - British fashion retailer Ted Baker said on Wednesday that inventory on its balance sheet was overstated by 58 million pounds ($75.7 million) - more than double its preliminary estimate. The company opened its first store in Glasgow in 1988 with quirky details on suits, shirts and dresses helping it to stand out from retail rivals and grow to its 560 stores and concessions globally. Ted Baker has, however, seen its fortunes turn for the worse after allegations against former chief executive and founder Ray Kelvin relating to his habit of hugging business colleagues surfaced in 2018. Kelvin denies any improper conduct. Following is a timeline of challenges the retailer has faced since then: Ted Baker says it will investigate claims against Kelvin relating to his habit of hugging business colleagues. Kelvin takes a voluntary leave of absence while allegations about his conduct were being investigated. Kelvin resigns as chief executive, seeking to allow the fashion brand he founded to move on from misconduct allegations. Ted Baker reports its first drop in annual profit since the 2008 financial crisis, highlighting tough conditions on Britain's high streets.

UPDATE 2-New blow for Ted Baker as accounting scandal doubles in size,Jan 22 2020,"* Inventory overstatement now estimated at 58 mln stg * Prior estimate was 20-25 mln stg * Latest in a series of setbacks for the company * Shares fall as much as 10% (Adds shares, background, analyst comment) By Yadarisa Shabong Jan 22 () - An accounting scandal at Ted Baker is more than twice as big as initially estimated, the British fashion retailer said on Wednesday, adding to a stream of bad news over the past year and sending its shares down as much as 10%. The company, known for suits, shirts and dresses with quirky details, said the value of stock on its balance sheet was overstated by 58 million pounds ($76 million) as at Jan. 26, 2019, more than double its preliminary estimate of up to 25 million pounds. Ted Baker, which has not revealed the reasons for the overstatement, said a review by business consultants Deloitte had largely been completed and it planned to update the market further at its preliminary results, expected in late March. The overstatement was disclosed in December, weeks after the company appointed Rachel Osborne as its new finance head. She was named acting chief executive officer later that month after the surprise exit of Lindsay Page. It is the latest in a string of setbacks in the last year, including profit warnings, a decision to suspend dividend payments, and management changes after misconduct allegations against founder and top shareholder Ray Kelvin, which he denies. Ted Baker shares have lost more than 80% of their value since December 2018, when the allegations about Kelvin's habit of hugging colleagues were first made. At 0904 GMT, the shares were down 7.2% at 296 pence, off an earlier low of 286.4 pence. The accounting scandal comes as Britain's store groups struggle with subdued consumer spending and a switch to more shopping online. Ted Baker reiterated there would be no cash impact from adjustments to the value of prior year inventories. The company in December appointed law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer to undertake an independent review of the overstatement  alongside Deloitte.

Lebanon dollar bonds rally after country forms government,Jan 22 2020,"LONDON, Jan 22 () - Lebanon sovereign dollar-bonds rallied as much as 1 cent on Wednesday after the country formed a government under Prime Minister Hassan Diab on Tuesday. The bond maturing in March this year jumped 1 cent to 84.02 cents in the dollar, according to MarketAxess. Bonds maturing in 2030 and 2037 gained 0.6 cents to trade just over 42 cents in the dollar, according to Tradeweb and Refinitiv. The heavily indebted state has been without effective government since Saad al-Hariri, Lebanon's main Sunni leader and a traditional ally of the West and Gulf Arab states, quit as premier in October following widespread protests against politicians who have led Lebanon into its worst crisis since the 1975-90 war. “Our base case is that the new cabinet's funding plan will likely entail external funding and attempt to restore confidence – as pointed out by Finance Minister Ghazi Wazni,” said Standard Chartered Bank economist Carla Slim, pointing to Prime Minister Diab's first official visit being set for the GCC countries.

"UPDATE 2-Malaysia's c.bank cuts rates in surprise move, warns risks remain",Jan 22 2020,"* Malaysia's c.bank makes surprise 25 bps cut * C.bank says rate cut ‘pre-emptive measure' to improve growth * Cut likely one-and-done for the year - UOB (Adds more details, analyst comments) By Joseph Sipalan KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 22 () - Malaysia's central bank surprised markets by cutting its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, calling it a pre-emptive move to ensure the country's improving growth trend continues. Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) said it expects growth to gradually improve with support from private spending, better external demand and a modest recovery in overall investment activity but warned downside risks to growth remained. “These include uncertainty from various trade negotiations, geopolitical risks, weaker-than-expected growth of major trade partners, heightened volatility in financial markets, and domestic factors that include weakness in commodity-related sectors and delays in the implementation of projects,” it said in a statement. The central bank cut its overnight policy rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 2.75%, the lowest since March 2011. Nearly all economists in a  poll had expected BNM to keep the rate unchanged. The central bank last cut its policy rate in May by 25 basis points, in a bid to boost growth amid concerns over flagging global demand. Julia Goh, a Malaysia-based economist with UOB Bank, said the rate cut was earlier than expected, but will help extend the stimulus effects from the May cut and provide more support for growth over the rest of the year. “It's probably one-and-done for now. Going forward, whether they would consider another rate cut really depends on the growth outlook and whether any risks start to emerge,” Goh said. Exports in November fell for a fourth month, contracting 5.5% from a year earlier, and recent palm oil curbs by India in retaliation against Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's criticism of Indian domestic policies, could maintain the downward pressure on shipments. However, the government expects thawing trade tensions between the United States and China to aid growth for export-reliant Malaysia. “Any improvement in global trade volume will increase demand for Malaysian exports, and directly boost Malaysian GDP growth,” Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said in a separate statement on Wednesday. Lim maintained the government's forecast of 4.8% growth in 2020, a slight uptick from the 4.7% pace it expects to set for the previous year. BNM may be too optimistic of its growth outlook for 2020 and will likely have to make a second cut in the second half of the year, said Alex Holmes, Asia economist for global economic consultancy Capital Economics. “In its statement BNM noted that it ‘expects growth to gradually improve' in 2020,” Holmes said in a note.

Australia's Westpac to appoint McFarlane as chairman - AFR,Jan 22 2020,"Jan 22 () - Westpac Banking Corp is set to appoint former Australia and New Zealand Banking Group chief executive John McFarlane to succeed chairman Lindsay Maxsted, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported  on Wednesday. Maxsted, who served as Westpac's chairman for eight years, said in November he would retire in the first half of 2020 after the bank was embroiled in a money laundering scandal involving child exploitation. Financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC filed a lawsuit against Westpac in November, accusing the country's No. 2 lender of enabling 23 million payments in breach of money laundering laws. The scandal saw Chief Executive Brian Hartzer step down after more than seven years with the company, while Maxsted said he would retire in early 2020, sooner than planned. The AFR said Westpac will announce the appointment on Thursday morning. Westpac did not immediately respond to a  request for comment.

"DAVOS-BlackRock, partners eye initial $500 mln for climate fund",Jan 22 2020,"* Climate Finance Partnership plans infrastructure fund * BlackRock takes first-loss tranche of at least $100 mln * To invest at least a quarter of capital in Africa By Simon Jessop and Sinead Cruise LONDON, Jan 22 () - A BlackRock-backed group aims to raise an initial $500 million for a private equity fund that will invest in climate change-linked infrastructure upgrades in emerging markets. BlackRock will provide the first $100 million of funding for the Climate Finance Partnership (CFP), which was set up in 2018 by France, Germany and the Hewlett and Grantham charitable foundations, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. The BlackRock funding will go toward a first-loss tranche that will absorb any initial losses, a safety net for other institutional investors which BlackRock expects to help it raise at least another $400 million. The CFP fund will be invested in renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy storage solutions and ultra-low and electric transport. At least a quarter of the investments would be made in Africa, with the rest in selected countries in South East Asia and Latin America, BlackRock said. The venture is part of a wide-ranging overhaul of the way BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, is responding to the issue of climate change, as part of a broader commitment to environmental, social and governance-related investing. In a recent annual letter to the thousands of companies in which BlackRock holds stakes, Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said the need to act was “particularly urgent” given many cities were not built to withstand “the new climate reality”. Climate has also been at the forefront of this year's annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, at which news of the planned initial fund-raising is set to be announced. “We believe creative collaboration is essential to mobilizing investment into climate infrastructure in emerging markets at scale, providing our clients with further opportunity to invest in the global low-carbon transition,” Brian Deese, Global Head of Sustainable Investing at BlackRock, said in the statement. France and Germany will both invest $30 million of the initial funding, while the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental Trust have pledged $10 million and $7.5 million, respectively. The CFP members have pledged to help raise the additional seed capital for the fund. BlackRock will invest an as yet determined amount in addition to the funding for the first-loss tranche.

Thai monetary policy should be accommodative for some time: central bank,Jan 22 2020,"BANGKOK () - Thailand's central bank said monetary policy should remain accommodative for some time to support economic growth and help inflation return to target.  The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) expects headline inflation - projected at 0.8% this year - to get back to the 1%-3% target range in the second half of 2021, the central bank said in an open letter to the finance minister dated Jan. 9. The breach of the target would be driven by supply-side pressures that would remain low, since a gradual global economic recovery continues to weigh on global energy prices, it said. “Looking ahead, the MPC views accommodative monetary policy should be maintained for some time so that overall financial conditions remain conducive to economic growth,” it said.  That “will facilitate the return of headline inflation to target, and at the same time takes into consideration financial stability risks,” the central bank said. (GRAPHIC: Thailand's Policy rate, GDP and CPI - ) The MPC stands ready to use various tools, ranging from the policy interest rate to microprudential and macroprudential measures, to achieve the monetary policy objectives most effectively, it added. The central bank left the benchmark interest rate THCBIR=ECI unchanged at a record low of 1.25% in December, after cutting it twice earlier in the year to support flagging growth and curb a strengthening baht .

UPDATE 3-Saudi Arabia raises $5 bln as bond investors brush off Gulf jitters,Jan 21 2020,"(Updates with size, details) By Davide Barbuscia DUBAI, Jan 21 () - Saudi Arabia has raised $5 billion in bonds after receiving around $20 billion in orders, a sign that an escalation in  geopolitical tensions in the Gulf has not deterred investors looking for high returns amid low global rates. The kingdom has issued bonds with maturities of seven, 12 and 35 years, a document by one of the banks leading the deal showed, as part of plans to raise $32 billion worth of debt this year as it seeks new financing channels in an era of lower oil prices. The bond sale is the first by a Gulf government this year and follows a rise in geopolitical tensions in the region after Iran and the United States, Saudi Arabia's ally, traded military strikes earlier this month. Riyadh raised $1.25 billion in seven-year bonds offering 85 basis points over U.S. Treasuries, $1 billion in 12-year notes with a spread of 110 basis points over the benchmark, and $2.75 billion in 35-year bonds, the kingdom's longest international bonds ever, with a 3.84% yield. Saudi Arabia's dollar bonds, among the most liquid in the region, have been relatively resilient after an attack on the facilities of state-owned oil giant Aramco last year and a U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani this month. The spreads on offer looked “cheap” when the bond sale began on Tuesday, particularly for the longer dated tranches, said Zeina Rizk, fixed income executive director at Dubai's Arqaam Capital. “There is definitely a risk premium linked to geopolitical risk, but markets didn't sell off as much as you would have expected them to after the Aramco attack or after Soleimani's strike. Initial price guidance is cheap but it will obviously tighten,” she said. Alberto Bigolin, executive director and head of MENA fixed income at Tellimer, said the initial premium was erased completely during the sale process. “Both the action on the Saudi sovereign curve in the past weeks and the pricing of the new issuance confirm that the demand for Saudi risk is there, despite the heightened geopolitical risk and the recent tensions in the Gulf.” Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Standard Chartered worked as joint global coordinators and lead managers, while BNP Paribas, HSBC, JPMorgan and NCB Capital have been hired as passive lead managers. Of Saudi Arabia's total planned debt issuance this year, almost $12 billion will be used to refinance existing local debt and will also be raised locally, a finance ministry official told  last month.

Xerox to nominate as many as 11 directors to HP's board in takeover push: Wall Street Journal,Jan 22 2020,"() - Xerox Holdings Corp () is preparing to nominate as many as 11 directors to HP Inc's () board, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, as the company seeks to push its $33.5 billion takeover offer for the personal computer maker. The U.S.-based printer maker bought a small stake in HP in recent weeks, the newspaper reported, citing sources. The stake would give Xerox the right to nominate directors for elections to be held at the HP's annual meeting this summer, the report said, adding that the deadline to nominate directors is Friday, and Xerox could still decide to not follow through with the nominations.

"Trump administration won't turn over auto import probe report, defying Congress",Jan 22 2020,"WASHINGTON () - The Trump administration is snubbing Congress by refusing to turn over a report detailing an investigation into national security risks potentially posed by imported vehicles and auto parts, citing pending international negotiations and executive branch deliberations. Congress inserted a provision in a spending bill last month demanding the White House turn over the long-secret government report that U.S. President Donald Trump used to declare in May 2019 that some unnamed imported autos pose risks to national security. Trump opted not to impose any immediate tariffs on imported cars or auto parts because of the alleged security threat and then ordered another six-month review on a decision on tariffs of up to 25%. The delay was to allow for more time for trade talks with the European Union and Japan. A person briefed on the matter said Trump had relied on a Justice Department opinion to order Commerce not to turn over the report under a Section 232 investigation. The Commerce Department said in a statement it was “not releasing the 232 autos report because releasing it now would interfere with the President's ability to protect confidential executive branch communications and could interfere with ongoing negotiations.” Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican, blasted the decision saying “by refusing to make public the statutorily-required report on automobile tariffs, the Department of Commerce is willfully violating federal law.” Toomey said he was “evaluating the potential for corrective action to compel the rightful release of this report.” On Tuesday, Trump said he was still considering imposing tariffs and mentioned imported European vehicles in particular, without singling out any brands. “We expect to be able to make a deal with Europe. And if they don't make a deal, we'll certainly give that very strong consideration,” Trump said. “But if we're unable to make a deal, we will have to do something.” The Justice Department opinion, seen by  before it was and made public on Tuesday, said Trump was justified in “withholding the report until the resolution of diplomatic negotiations” and any subsequent action. It said he could “rely on the constitutional doctrine of executive privilege to decline to release the report.” A spokesman for Senator Chuck Grassley, the Republican who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said the Justice Department memo “doesn't seem to have much merit on its face. The law as passed by Congress is clear.” The White House declined comment. Some U.S. lawmakers want to restrict presidential authority to invoke the tariffs on national security grounds. In May, Trump said he agreed with the undisclosed report's finding that found some imported cars and trucks were  “weakening our internal economy” and threatened to harm U.S. national security. But automakers have warned tariffs would cost hundreds of thousands of auto jobs, dramatically raise prices on vehicles and threaten industry spending on self-driving cars. An ad hoc group called “Here for America” representing major German and Asian automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG () and Nissan Motor Co, said “there is no compelling reason not to disclose this report to the public, or to restrict trade in an industry that supports the jobs of millions of Americans.” It previously called the national security designation “absurd.” ","{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': 0.8975}",0.8975

Lebanon forms government with backing of Hezbollah and allies,Jan 21 2020,"BEIRUT () - Lebanon formed a new government on Tuesday under Prime Minister Hassan Diab after the Shi'ite group Hezbollah and its allies agreed on a cabinet that must urgently address an economic crisis.        The heavily indebted state has been without effective government since Saad al-Hariri quit as premier in October, prompted by protests against politicians who have collectively led Lebanon into the worst crisis since the 1975-90 war. New Finance Minister Ghazi Wazni said Lebanon needed foreign aid to save it from an unprecedented situation that had forced people to “beg for dollars” at the banks and fear for their deposits. He also described forthcoming foreign currency sovereign debt maturities as “a fireball”. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah and allies including President Michel Aoun nominated Diab as premier last month after efforts failed to strike a deal with Hariri, Lebanon's main Sunni leader and a traditional ally of the West and Gulf Arab states. Weeks of wrangling over portfolios among Hezbollah's allies held up an agreement until Tuesday, when the heavily armed group delivered an ultimatum to its allies to make a deal or suffer the consequences, sources familiar with the talks said. The cabinet is made up of 20 specialist ministers backed by parties. Wazni, an economist who had served as an adviser to parliament's finance and budget committee, was nominated with the backing of Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. Nassif Hitti, a former ambassador to the Arab League, was named foreign minister with the backing of Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement. Diab described his government as a technocratic “rescue team” that would work to achieve protesters' goals. His first trip abroad would be to the Arab region, particularly the Gulf. But analysts said Hezbollah's role meant Diab might have trouble winning foreign support. Protesters took to the streets of Beirut as the government was announced. Police fired water canons at stone-throwing demonstrators near parliament who tried to dismantle newly erected barricades. “This government doesn't reflect us,” said protester Rabih Al-Zein.  The absence of a government had left Lebanon rudderless as ordinary people suffered in the crisis. A liquidity crunch has led banks to restrict access to cash and the Lebanese pound to slump. Jobs have been lost and inflation has soared. Over the last week, hundreds have been injured in clashes between the security forces and demonstrators. Hezbollah is designated as a terrorist group by the United States, and Sunni-led Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Arab states that have provided Lebanon with financial aid in the past have for years been deeply concerned by its rising influence in Beirut.     “It will certainly not be easy for a government of this type to convince the outside world to help Lebanon,” said Nabil Boumonsef, deputy editor-in-chief of the An-Nahar newspaper.     Hariri and his Future Movement have stayed out of the government, along with the staunchly anti-Hezbollah Christian Lebanese Forces party and the Progressive Socialist Party of Druze leader Walid Jumblatt. “Any government is better than a vacuum because what is coming is more difficult,” Jumblatt wrote on Twitter. Mohanad Hage Ali, a fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, said the new government of “one color” could further polarize Lebanese politics.

Midwest utility Evergy stands by business plan as Elliott challenges,Jan 22 2020,"BOSTON/NEW YORK () - U.S. midwestern utility Evergy Inc () affirmed on Tuesday its faith in its business plan after activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp urged the firm to improve its performance or consider a merger with another power company. Shares in Kansas City, Missouri-headquartered Evergy earlier hit a lifetime high after Elliott disclosed its demands and that it had an economic interest of 11.3 million shares - making it Evergy's fourth-largest shareholder, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The stock closed 2% higher, giving the company a market cap of around $15.7 billion. Elliott said in its statement that some $5 billion of value could be added to Evergy if the company stopped its share buyback program, cut operations and maintenance costs, and deployed more cash into developing its infrastructure network, including building more renewable power generation. Evergy got 40% of its power from coal-fired plants in 2018, with renewables contributing 25% of its generation mix, according to an Evergy presentation dated November 2019. Alternatively, the firm should merge itself with another utility that could improve Evergy's performance, Elliott added. Acknowledging that it had been talking to Elliott since October, Evergy said in a separate statement that, while it was open to evaluating opportunities, “we are confident in our ability to deliver long-term growth and shareholder value creation through the execution of our strategic plan.” It added that its current plan offered the best returns within the regulatory framework it agreed with watchdogs in Kansas and Missouri when it became Evergy in 2018, following the merging of Great Plains Energy and Westar Energy. Evergy's creation followed a two-year regulatory battle: first announced in 2016 as Great Plains buying Westar, the transaction was restructured as a merger-of-equals after the Kansas Corporation Commission objected to how a Great Plains purchase would impact the combined company's finances and customer bills. In a note, Wells Fargo analysts said while Evergy was an attractive target, the previous merger experience made it cautious toward getting regulatory sign-off on a new deal.  Any opportunities to invest in modernization and more renewables were restricted by Evergy's plan with regulators, the bank added. Activist investor Elliott has targeted a number of utilities in recent years: its last campaign focused on Sempra Energy (), with a settlement involving board seats and a review of Sempra's assets between the California-based utility and Elliott agreed in September 2018. Elliott is also a creditor in the ongoing bankruptcy of California utility PG&E Corp (). ","{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.178, 'compound': 0.996}",0.996

UPDATE 1-Spain's Sabadell sells asset management unit to Amundi for 430 mln euros,Jan 22 2020,"(Adds details from joint statement) MADRID, Jan 21 () - Spain's Banco de Sabadell has agreed to sell its asset management arm to French asset manager Amundi SA for 430 million euros ($477 million), the companies said on Tuesday. The sale, which is set to close in the third quarter of 2020, will generate net capital gains of 351 million euros for Sabadell and boost its common equity tier 1 ratio (CET-1) by 43 basis points, according to the statement. The unit has assets under management of around 21.8 billion euros, excluding third-party funds. The deal will be financed through the existing cash of the French asset management company, the statement added. Amundi, Europe's biggest asset manager, has been present in Spain since 2002 through its Amundi Iberia subsidiary. The units of Sabadell Asset Management and Amundi Iberia will remain separate legal entities, the companies said, citing the need to preserve their operations of investment funds and pension plans. Amundi has grown through sizeable deals in the past, including the purchase of UniCredit's asset management unit Pioneer Investments, which it bought for 3.6 billion euros in 2016. Commenting on the deal, brokerage Jefferies said the price was lower than expected. “We note the price is materially less than the 700 million euros that was posited back in October,” Jefferies said in a note.

Bankers ‘bombard' Guyana with financing plans as oil boom begins: finance minister,Jan 21 2020,"GEORGETOWN () - Bankers are “bombarding” Guyana with offers of financing backed by future oil production, the finance minister told , but the South American nation is rejecting the proposals to avoid the excessive borrowing that has plagued other oil producers. As the former British colony begins its first significant oil production this year, it is wary of avoiding the mistakes made in oil-dependent economies such as Angola, Nigeria and its economically collapsing neighbor Venezuela. Winston Jordan, an economist and career public servant, also cited Guyana's own history of economic crisis in the 1980s for turning down overtures to finance infrastructure and development before oil money started flowing. “At the IMF meetings, I was bombarded, at the IDB meetings, I'm bombarded with people telling you how much money they can lend you,” he said in an interview on Wednesday in his Georgetown office, referring to the International Monetary Fund and Inter-American Development Bank. He declined to name the specific institutions, saying only that “quite a few banks, quite a few middlemen” offered loans of between $500 million and $2 billion. During the oil boom years, Venezuela borrowed more than $50 billion from China through loans that were repaid in oil shipments, a practice later replicated in Ecuador. The arrangements were criticized for lack of transparency. A consortium led by Exxon Mobil () has discovered more than 6 billion barrels of oil and gas off Guyana, a find that could transform the impoverished country's agriculture- and mining-dependent economy. With fewer than 800,000 inhabitants, Guyana is seen as a test for whether oil revenue can spur sustainable development in a country lacking strong institutions.  Other petrostates have seen crude sales lead to corruption and debt-fueled spending binges, often described as the “resource curse.” Guyana in the early 1980s defaulted on foreign debt, fueling an economic crisis characterized by chronic shortages of consumer goods. Following economic austerity and debt relief, the economy began recovering in the 1990s. “I much rather that we slowly ramp up,” Jordan said. “We will avoid resource curse.” Legislation this year established that Guyana's oil revenue will flow to a sovereign wealth fund, and withdrawals must fund specific projects rather than day-to-day expenses. Committees to oversee the fund have not been formed because the opposition and the private sector have not named representatives, Jordan said.  The opposition People's Progressive Party has said President David Granger's government overstepped its authority by forming the fund, given its “caretaker” status after losing a 2018 no-confidence vote. The opposition is promising a new sovereign wealth fund “insulated from political interference.” ","{'neg': 0.113, 'neu': 0.826, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': -0.9779}",-0.9779
DAVOS-The Greta and Trump show - Davos highlights on Tuesday,Jan 22 2020,"DAVOS, Switzerland Jan 21 () - The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) kicked off on Tuesday in the ski town of Davos. Here are the highlights from Day 1: Greta Thunberg and U.S. President Donald Trump dominated as they both attempted to frame arguments around climate change. Speaking thousand miles away from where his impeachment trial was due to start, Trump backed a tree planting initiative and dismissed the “perennial prophets of doom” on climate change. Trump did not name Thunberg, but she was sitting in the audience and responded less than an hour later in a packed auditorium. “Our house is still on fire,” Thunberg said, repeating her warning at the WEF meeting a year ago. “Your inaction is fuelling the flames,” the 17-year-old added, in the latest to-and-fro with the 73-year-old president. Often seen as the preserve of rich, old men, this year's Davos has been invigorated by fresh voices, energy and Doc Martens with many young activists following their role model Thunberg up the Alps. The first panel of the four-day gathering made clear the shift, with a combined age of 64, much younger than the WEF's 81-year-old founder Klaus Schwab. Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam and “Team HK”, including its trade secretary, top officials from the stock exchange, airport authority, MTR Corp and the head of Swire Group, are on a mission to reassure after a Moody's downgrade this week. Lam sought to convince global business and political leaders that the Asian financial hub is open for business. Apple chief executive Tim Cook was to attend a dinner with Trump, along with other global heads of business organized with the help of Trump's adviser and daughter, Ivanka Trump, a source familiar with the situation said. Saudi finance minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told  on the sidelines of Davos that the proceeds of last month's listing of oil giant Saudi Aramco would be pumped into the local economy over several years, including building up defence systems. With nearly $30 billion coming from Aramco's local share offering last month, new and existing local industries, including defence and technology, will get a boost, Jadaan said.

Spain's ACS withdraws from Inga 3 hydro project in Congo,Jan 22 2020,"MADRID () - Spain's ACS is withdrawing from the multi-billion-dollar Inga 3 hydroelectric project in Democratic Republic of Congo, the company said on Tuesday, dealing a further setback to plans to develop Africa's largest hydro plant.  A consortium led by Actividades de Construccion y Servicios signed a preliminary agreement with one led by China Three Gorges [CYTGP.UL] in 2018 to jointly develop the 11,000 megawatt project. However, the two sides had been unable to agree on how to proceed to construction. An ACS spokesman told : “The ACS group will not participate in the execution of the project.” He provided no explanation for the decision to withdraw.  The head of the government agency overseeing development of Inga 3, part of a planned series of dams along the Congo River that could eventually produce more than 40,000 MW, said Congo was awaiting formal notification of ACS's withdrawal.  It said however that the project would proceed. “Let's wait and see. The important thing for me is that Inga has become a reality, and is attracting interest from many developers,” Bruno Kapandji told . The long-mooted project has been plagued by financing issues. In 2016 the World Bank suspended tens of millions of dollars in funding, criticizing Inga 3's “strategic direction” after the government assigned the portfolio to the president's office. Elisabeth Caesens, director of Brussels-based advocacy group Resource Matters, said ACS had been on the fence for while and did not want to commit extra money to such a risky investment. “While ACS added weight to the ProInga consortium, it was not its driving force,” Caesens said.  “We can expect the remaining Spanish company and the Chinese majors with which it has been asked to form a joint consortium to actively look for a more enthusiastic partner to integrate the team.”  Resource Matters said in a report in October that Spanish company AEE Power was the more active player in the ProInga consortium with ACS.   In December, Congo President Felix Tshisekedi floated the idea of reverting to earlier plans to build Inga 3 with a 4,800-MW capacity, and gradually expand later. Disagreements over the sequencing of the project and ownership stakes led to a breakdown in cooperation between the Chinese and Spanish consortia late last year. Much of the output from Inga 3, which was expected to take eight years to build, has been earmarked for South Africa, with the rest going toward Congo's mining sector and population.

Britain's Sainsbury's to cut hundreds of management jobs,Jan 21 2020,"LONDON () - Britain's Sainsbury's () plans to cut hundreds of management jobs as it seeks to bring its main supermarket operation and its Argos general merchandise arm closer together, it said on Tuesday. It said the jobs would go in commercial, retail, finance, digital, technology and human resources functions. It did not give a precise figure. Sainsbury's also said that since the start of its 2019-20 financial year in March, its senior leadership team has been reduced by over 20%.

Shareholder in Russia's Alrosa proposes selling up to $1 billion of diamonds to Gokhran: Ifax,Jan 21 2020,"MOSCOW () - The government of Russia's Yakutia region, a major shareholder in diamond producer Alrosa, has proposed that precious metals and gems repository Gokhran buy $0.5-$1 billion of the firm's rough diamonds this year, Interfax news agency reported. The proposal was made to President Vladimir Putin and Russia's finance ministry, which is responsible for Gokhran within the government, Interfax quoted Aysen Nikolaev, the head of Yakutia region, as saying on Tuesday. Diamond miners are battling falling demand, as well as competition from diamonds manufactured in laboratories.  Alrosa is the world's largest producer of rough diamonds in carat terms. Together with Anglo American's De Beers unit, it produces about half of the world's rough diamonds. The company said in a statement to  that such a sale would only be undertaken if the market situation deteriorates significantly. The company remains profitable and fully able to meet its social obligations, it said.  “Based on the results of the Christmas retail season, we see signs of a revival of demand in the main market and a decrease in midstream stocks,” Alrosa added. Nikolaev, also first deputy chairman of Alrosa's board of directors, said in an interview with Interfax that “there are different options - from $500 million to $1 billion”. “Any option suits us,” he added. “Perhaps, it makes sense (for Alrosa) not to sell them for several years before demand recovers, but to sell them to Gokhran, as was done in the late 2000s,” Nikolaev said. Gokhran bought diamonds worth $1 billion from Alrosa, which is 33% held by Yakutia and its regions, during years of weak demand caused by the global financial crisis in 2008-2009. If approved by the finance ministry and the government, the proposal would require a sharp increase in Gokhran's current 2020 budget for purchases, as it is limited to 10.5 billion roubles ($170 million). The Yakutia region, Alrosa's management and the finance ministry have agreed to review the idea in detail after Alrosa's first-half sales, Nikolaev said.

Pound near day's highs as strong UK jobs data trims rate cut bets,Jan 22 2020,"* Employment jumps by stronger-than-expected 208,000 * May undermine BoE case for rate cut next week * Graphic: World FX rates in 2019  * Graphic: Trade-weighted sterling since Brexit vote  (Adds quotes, graphic) By Tommy Wilkes and Saikat Chatterjee LONDON, Jan 21 () - The pound held near the day's highs on Tuesday after the British economy created jobs at its strongest rate in nearly a year in the three months to November, potentially undermining the case for a Bank of England interest rate cut next week. Expectations of a rate cut have been steadily building in recent weeks thanks to dovish comments from central bank policymakers and a raft of weak data but the latest jobs figures undermined some of those bets, prompting investors to wait for January manufacturing survey figures due on Friday. The pound rose nearly half a percent to $1.3083, up from around $1.3010 before the data was released. Against the euro, sterling also added 0.4% to 84.94 pence. It trimmed some of those gains in late afternoon trading but held near the day's highs. Tuesday's reading showed the number of people in employment rose by 208,000 to 32.90 million, the biggest increase since the three months to January 2019 and much stronger than the median forecast in a  poll for a rise of 110,000. Excluding bonuses, which smooth out some volatility, the data also showed that pay growth slowed a touch to 3.4% annually in November, the slowest since the three months to April 2019. Economists had expected regular pay to grow by 3.4%, although with low inflation earnings are rising in real terms. “Although lagged, today's jobs print helped in reducing bets for BOE easing in the near future,” Scotiabank strategists said in a note. Money market expectations for a 25-basis-point rate cut fell slightly to around 62%, from around two-thirds earlier in the day. Three BoE policymakers have recently said that more stimulus might be needed including a cut to rates to boost a flagging economy, although many analysts say policymakers could hold off if data shows an economic rebound in December following the general election. Purchasing Managers Index surveys on Friday will provide a clue as to whether that rebound occurred. “Risk reward is not in favour of chasing GBP lower into a rate cut: With the BoE rate cut priced with a 66% chance, the risk reward is that they delay their decision until later this year to evaluate how the data and fiscal stimulus plays out. GBP/USD would naturally head higher as a result,” Nomura analyst Jordan Rochester said. Nomura advises a long position on the pound via a two-month option though some analysts think the pound looks on shaky ground, however. “Sterling remains vulnerable in the short term, given positioning,” Kit Juckes, an analyst at Societe Generale, said, referring to the net long position speculators have built up in the pound this year. On Monday, sterling fell to as low as $1.2962 after UK finance minister Sajid Javid said at the weekend that Britain would not commit to sticking to European Union rules in post-Brexit trade talks.

UK Treasury asks banks for ideas to boost 'left-behind' Northern towns,Jan 21 2020,"LONDON () - Britain's finance ministry has canvassed banks for ideas to boost the country's “left-behind” northern towns and cities, weeks after the governing Conservatives won an election promising to boost the regions outside London. The call comes as figures show lending by banks to small and medium sized businesses has shrunk rapidly in the north of England. Treasury officials have requested policy ideas for fuelling growth in the north of England in meetings with banks and finance industry trade bodies including since the new year, banking industry sources told . Policy ideas drawn up by finance firms include developing better technical skills locally, setting up regional specialist hubs and moving financial regulators from London to give start-ups better support in meeting requirements when setting up. Banks have attracted criticism for doing too little to support Britain's regional economies, including slashing their branch networks in small towns and rural areas. Outstanding lending to small firms in the northwest and northeast of England fell by 15% and 8% respectively between the end of 2014 and June last year, according to data from trade body UK Finance, compared to a 2% increase in London. The regional lending trends were first reported by the Times newspaper.     A spokesman for the Treasury confirmed officials had asked finance firms how they could play a role in boosting the regions. “The financial services sector is vital to our economy, which is why we are working closely with firms to ensure that together we promote growth, create jobs and boost investment across the whole of the UK,” the spokesman added. The request comes ahead of finance minister Sajid Javid presenting the government's budget in March. Javid has said injecting cash into the regions will be a priority. “We've been asked what do people in financial services need. It's very northern-specific and very northern-focussed,” a banking source said. “There's a recognition from officials that it can't all be about delivering shiny new infrastructure projects.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party won a big majority last month, winning scores of seats in the north of England, traditional heartlands of the opposition Labour Party. Since then Johnson has pledged to ‘level up' the regions to repay his new backers' support, although opposition politicians have expressed scepticism and blame the Conservatives' previous austerity policies for harming the regions. Finance jobs are heavily skewed toward London, although several other cities each employ more than 30,000 people in the sector, including Glasgow and Edinburgh in Scotland, and Leeds and Manchester in northern England. Britain has struggled for decades to find ways of fuelling regional growth outside London. The government already spends more than it generates in taxes in every part of Britain apart from London, the South-east and the East, according to  analysis of public spending data. Miles Celic, CEO of TheCityUK, a finance industry trade group, said: “Ensuring the industry's future as a national asset will require a concerted effort. This includes more regionally focused policies and initiatives.” ","{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.819, 'pos': 0.153, 'compound': 0.996}",0.996
"Most new housing designs in England are 'substandard', audit finds",Jan 21 2020,"LONDON (Thomson  Foundation) - Three quarters of new housing developments in England are so badly designed they should never have been built, according to an independent audit released on Tuesday. Britain has seen a building boom in recent years spurred by government policies designed to address a housing shortage that has pushed up prices and contributed to homelessness. The national audit, conducted by University College London (UCL), reviewed more than 140 housing developments built across England since 2007 and found one in five should have been refused planning permission. Another 54% should have had ‘significant improvements' to their designs with flaws ranging from poor access to roads to lack of waste storage facilities, parking or high quality green spaces, the report said. “It's really a national tragedy,” said the report's author Matthew Carmona, a professor at UCL's Bartlett School of Planning. “The pressure to build is in a sense absolutely right, we need more homes, but we need more homes of a good quality that people can thrive in and communities can grow in,” he told the Thomson  Foundation.   The number of new homes built in England topped 170,000 in the year to June, according to government data, an 11-year high, boosted by a ‘Help to Buy' scheme that offers buyers of newly built homes a government equity loan.     The scheme, targeted at new-build properties, is designed to help buyers with a small deposit get access to mortgage financing.    Andrew Whitaker, planning director at the Home Builders Federation, a representative body, said the overwhelming majority of new home buyers were “happy with their new home and the wider environment around it”.     The UCL audit found poor communities were 10 times more likely to get badly designed homes - even when a better design was affordable. The quality of Britain's social housing has been under intense scrutiny since a fire killed 71 people at London's Grenfell Tower in 2017. An inquiry last year found that combustible material on the building's exterior had contributed to the scale of the tragedy. Britain has experienced a shortage of social housing since the 1980s, when the government allowed tenants to buy their homes at rock-bottom prices without replacing the stock. Since then, years of underbuilding, rising rents and cuts to social-housing benefits have exacerbated the problem. “There is no excuse for shoddy design,” a spokeswoman for Britain's ministry of housing told the Thomson  Foundation by email. “We also expect developers to make sure new homes are well designed, and our new national design guide sets out how beautiful places can be achieved in practice, ensuring slap-dash proposals don't get built.” ","{'neg': 0.104, 'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': -0.9125}",-0.9125

UPDATE 1-South Africa appoints new board at state nuclear firm,Jan 21 2020,"(Adds detail, context) JOHANNESBURG, Jan 21 () - South Africa's energy minister Gwede Mantashe has appointed seven board members at state nuclear firm Necsa, Mantashe's ministry said on Tuesday. Necsa is one of the world's largest producers of medical radioisotopes and promotes research and development in nuclear energy. It has been mired in a financial and operational crisis, like other South African state-run firms including power utility Eskom, but is much less of a burden on the country's stretched public finances due to its smaller size. The appointments follow the resignation last week of Necsa's remaining board members. Local media have cited disagreements with Mantashe over how to revive the company as the cause of the resignations, although his ministry has not given a reason for them. Eskom's former chief nuclear officer David Nicholls will chair the new Necsa board. ","{'neg': 0.101, 'neu': 0.835, 'pos': 0.064, 'compound': -0.824}",-0.824
Swedish refiner Nynas proposes restructuring to escape U.S. sanctions,Jan 21 2020,"STOCKHOLM () - Swedish oil refiner Nynas, which is owned by Venezuela's state-run PDVSA and Finland's Neste Oil, said on Tuesday it planned to reorganize its business in an attempt to disentangle itself from U.S. sanctions imposed on Venezuela. Nynas said the proposed changes to its ownership structure, backed by both PDVSA and Neste Oil, were filed with the United States' Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on January 17. The refiner, which was placed in the hands of a court-appointed administrator late last year, added that it would only proceed with the changes if and when OFAC confirmed that the move would mean Nynas no longer being subject to its sanctions. “The sanctions against PDVSA and Venezuela have had a considerable negative impact on Nynas' operations. It is therefore necessary to immediately make changes to the ownership structure,” the company said in a 17-page document.  The reorganization is vital for the Swedish refiner, which said in December that the sanctions had cut it off from bank funding and left it unable to pay its debts. Nynas said on Tuesday that relief from the sanctions would allow it to trade in U.S. dollars and access credit again.  The United States in October introduced changes to a license that had previously allowed Nynas to import Venezuelan oil despite sanctions imposed on its owner PDVSA, sparking a crisis at the refiner which employs about 1,000 people in Sweden, Germany and Britain. Nynas said in the document it had engaged Carnegie Investment Bank AB to secure short-term bridge financing of 1.5 billion Swedish crowns ($158 million) and attract new investors. The company, which specializes in products for asphalt production, said it now needs to purchase oil as its current stock runs out in March. Nynas added that it does not expect to be able to buy Venezuelan oil even if OFAC approves the changes, meaning it will need to find new suppliers and adapt its equipment.  Nynas said the restructuring plan does not include any job cuts. ","{'neg': 0.052, 'neu': 0.868, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': 0.8481}",0.8481
"Aramco IPO proceeds to fund Saudi industry, including defense: finance minister",Jan 21 2020,"DAVOS, Switzerland () - Saudi Arabia will pump the proceeds from last month's listing of oil giant Saudi Aramco into the local economy over several years, including building up the domestic defense industry amid tensions with Iran, its finance minister said on Tuesday. Mohammed al-Jadaan told  there were “serious efforts” to reduce antagonism between Washington and Tehran after a top Iranian general was killed in a U.S. air strike and Iran retaliated with missile attacks against American bases in Iraq. “If you look at history, we in this region have managed to weather through worse geopolitical situations, including actual, real wars,” he said in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. “We in Saudi have to focus on the economy and reform ... We firmly believe the disputes can only be resolved by dialogue.” A string of attacks last year on tankers in Gulf waters and Saudi oil sites, including the world's largest oil processing facility, pierced Saudi defenses and threatened to derail a reform agenda aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil. Riyadh and Washington blame the strikes on Iran, which denies involvement but has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz shipping channel in retaliation for sanctions placed on its crude exports by Western powers. The United States is sending additional military forces to Saudi Arabia, and France has deployed a radar system to bolster the kingdom's air defenses. Even before the recent tensions, Riyadh had begun a drive to localize 50% of military spending led by Saudi Arabian Military Industries, owned by the state Public Investment Fund (PIF). With nearly $30 billion coming into PIF coffers from Aramco's local share offering last month, new and existing local industries, including defense and technology, will get a boost in capital, Jadaan said. “We work with our military industry to develop our own military assets in the mid-term to deal with these risks, including investment by PIF,” he added. The Saudi economy, the largest in the Arab world, remains dominated by hydrocarbon revenues despite plans to diversify. It has suffered in recent years because of low oil prices and austerity measures aimed at reducing a huge budget deficit. Jadaan said he expected to see healthier oil prices in 2020 due to solid demand, reduced output and easing trade tensions. He also predicted a smaller deficit by the end of the year than announced last month, when Riyadh said it could face a deficit of nearly $50 billion this year. Yet the International Monetary Fund on Monday lowered its forecast for Saudi Arabia's economic growth to 1.9% this year due to output cuts agreed last month with the OPEC+ group of oil producers. Saudi Arabia has said it expects growth of 2.3%. “Our focus is firmly on non-oil GDP growth, with focus on tourism, entertainment, sports, technology and financial sector,” Jadaan said. He said the presidency of the Group of 20 major economies, which Saudi Arabia assumed this year, was an important step towards resolving the region's problems. “It is critical the world's attention is brought to the Middle East,” said Jadaan. “If you deal with some of the regional problems, it will be a relief for the world.” ","{'neg': 0.128, 'neu': 0.781, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': -0.9643}",-0.9643

EU lending arm EIB set to keep tight Turkey restrictions in place,Jan 21 2020,"LONDON () - The European Union's lending arm, the European Investment Bank, expects to keep its lending heavily restricted in Turkey this year, as an EU row with Ankara over oil and gas drilling off Cyprus rumbles on. The EIB was one of Turkey's biggest sources of financing last decade, pumping almost 19 billion euros into the country, but all but turned off the taps last year when diplomatic tensions over the drilling worsened. It stopped lending to infrastructure projects or any firm with links to the Turkish government but kept open the option to lend to parts of the private sector.  The drilling row has again deteriorated. Turkey's energy minister said on Friday a new drilling ship was about to set off for Cyprus, and EU foreign affairs commissioner Josep Borrell said on Monday sanctions were in the works. Asked about the EIB's lending restrictions, a spokesman for the bank said it would continue to act “in line with the approach adopted by EU Member States and the EU Commission.” “Unless there is a change in direction at EU level, we will probably maintain the selective approach (to lending in Turkey) we have had in the past couple of years, at least for the foreseeable future,” he said.  The EIB's website shows it has approved only one loan in Turkey since last July's announcement that it was reviewing its work there.  There is also friction over the creation of a ‘buffer zone' inside Syria, from where Turkey had feared another cross-border exodus of refugees to join the 3.5 million already in Turkey.   The EIB disbursed over 52 billion euros ($57.31 billion) last year but lent only 117 million euros in Turkey, its figures show. This compared to more than 2 billion euros lent in Turkey in all but one of the years between 2009 and 2016. Its overall Turkish exposure is about 15 billion euros. Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said in November the EU's  sanctions resolutions over the drilling were “null and void” and that Turkey had started another set of operations south of the Karpas peninsula.

McDermott to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection,Jan 21 2020,"() - U.S. oilfield services provider McDermott International Inc MDR.N said on Tuesday it would file for prepackaged bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, as it looks to cut debt that ballooned following a major acquisition in 2018. The restructuring will be financed by a debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing of $2.81 billion, the company said. As part of the deal, McDermott has also entered a stalking-horse agreement to sell its Lummus Technology unit for $2.73 billion. DIP financing packages allow bankrupt companies to remain in business and fund operations as bankruptcy case proceeds. Texas-based McDermott's total debt stood at $9.86 billion as of Nov. 4, 2019. “As a result of the transaction, we are eliminating over $4.6 billion in debt from our balance sheet and we will emerge with robust liquidity and significant financing to execute on customer projects in our backlog,” Chief Executive Officer of McDermott David Dickson said in a note.  McDermott's shares were down 15% in premarket trade. Bloomberg reported on Friday the company was preparing to file for bankruptcy.. McDermott has been reeling under heavy debt since it combined its offshore engineering and construction business with Chicago Bridge & Iron Co (CB&I) in an all-stock deal valued at around $6 billion including nearly $4 billion in debt. The company's total liabilities jumped to $7.86 billion at the end of June 2018 after it acquired CB&I, from $1.36 billion in the previous quarter. McDermott last year raised another $1.7 billion to support its operations and concurrently withdrew its full-year forecast.

Brazil's growth at mercy of hotly disputed 'expansionary austerity',Jan 21 2020,"BRASILIA () - Brazil's right-wing government has entered 2020 doubling down on one of the principal economic policies that marked its first year in office: the controversial view that aggressively slashing spending will spur and accelerate economic growth. In a paper entitled “Expansionary fiscal consolidation in Brazil” published Dec. 31, it argued cleaning up public finances will fuel private sector confidence and demand, and ultimately a boom in economic activity. According to the paper, which reflects the thinking of Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, the fiscal consolidation underway will have a near instant positive impact.  “This is based on the perception that fiscal policy has non-Keynesian effects in the current context of the Brazilian economy, in contrast with the alternative and in our view mistaken assertion that increased spending is a way of stimulating economic activity,” it said. Government spending fell in the second and third quarters of 2019, the first time in more than two years it has fallen for two straight quarters. It almost certainly fell in the fourth. On an annual comparison basis, government consumption is falling 1.4%, on course to contract at its fastest rate in almost 20 years.  (GRAPHIC: Brazil Govt Consupmption - Y/Y change: ) After trade, it is the only segment of the economy providing a negative contribution to growth. Agriculture, industry, business investment, services and consumer spending are all expanding, albeit at a far from blistering pace.  But the notion that this drag on growth in and of itself somehow boosts private sector investment and spending has been widely criticized - many would say debunked - since the financial crisis of 2007-09. Robert Skidelsky, professor emeritus of political economy at Warwick University in Britain, has derided the notion of a “confidence fairy” as no more believable than the tooth fairy, arguing that “(economic) recovery may come about despite fiscal austerity, but never because of it.” Not everyone thinks it's make-believe. Carlos Kawall, director at Asa Bank in Sao Paulo, argues that the economy's current 2-2.5% annualized growth is largely down to the fiscal discipline which allowed the central bank to cut interest rates to a record low 4.5%. “If the government spends more, interest rates will go back up and you will not get the economic benefits we're currently seeing in terms of consumer credit and spending, business investment, and now growth,” Kawall said.  “This policy is working. It's harder to grow this way, but it's more sustainable.” Nominally, the government's 54.22 billion reais public expenditure bill in the third quarter of 2019 was the lowest in almost seven years. As a share of GDP, Brazilian government spending is also falling, albeit more slowly. It remains high: at around 18-19% of GDP it is above the Latin American and Caribbean average, according to the World Bank, and in 2018 was higher than emerging market peers China, Russia, India and South Korea. Nearly half of its outlay in 2018 went on pensions, one of the highest in the world and the impetus for sweeping social security reform that helped drive the Bovespa stock market's 32% rally last year, over double the MSCI emerging index. Markets have responded strongly. But the economy hasn't, and probably won't, according to Monica De Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. While Brazil needs to get public finances back on a more even keel, De Bolle says there is no empirical or historical evidence that ‘expansionary austerity' delivers economic growth.  Brazil should target public sector inefficiencies to generate savings and funding for social programs to protect those most vulnerable to the effects of austerity, rather than reducing the size of the state per se. What's more, such an aggressive squeeze is unnecessary. Unlike Argentina, or Brazil in the late 1990s, the country does not face a balance of payments crisis.  It has $360 billion in foreign currency reserves, foreign direct investment more than covers the current account deficit, and local firms are borrowing more in reais, reducing the private sector's exposure to foreign currency debt.  “This idea of expansionary austerity should have died with the emerging market experiences of the 1990s. It failed miserably, especially in Asia. It's a mixture of ideology and bad economics,” De Bolle said. ","{'neg': 0.101, 'neu': 0.83, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': -0.9702}",-0.9702
Germany to ensure coal exit doesn't undermine EU's CO2 trading system: draft,Jan 21 2020,"BERLIN () - Germany wants to ensure that its plan to cancel emissions certificates issued for coal power stations that are due to be shuttered doesn't undermine the EU's emissions trading system, the government said in a draft law seen by  on Tuesday. It plans to achieve this by making use of the EU's Market Stability Reserve, a mechanism that went into effect last year with the aim to take back excess permits from the market.              The government proposal also stipulates that the German finance and economy ministries will work with at least two independent appraisers to determine how many certificates placed in the EU reserve should be cancelled. Chancellor Angela Merkel's government wants to shut all of Germany's coal-fired power plants by 2038 at the latest as part of measures to help it achieve a target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to 55% of their 1990 level by 2030. The draft says Germany would inform the EU about the scale of permissions in the emission permits reserve it wishes to cancel in the calendar year after the power plants had been shut down. Germany will then issue fewer carbon certificates to ensure its coal exit doesn't exacerbate a surplus of emissions permits that has built up in the EU, leading to lower carbon prices and weaker incentives to cut emissions. The draft also says that Germany will force the closure of power plants fired by hard coal starting in 2027 if utilities do not take up compensation tenders, a U-turn that appears to be designed to pressure utilities to accept compensation. The government said in a draft last year it would not force hard coal power plants to close over the next seven years and that it would use a mixture of subsidies and tenders to encourage operators to close polluting plants. The government proposal said tenders for compensation would be assessed between 2024 and 2026 and forced closures would ensue if utilities operating hard coal plants failed to apply.

Shareholder in Russia's Alrosa proposes selling up to $1 bln of diamonds to Gokhran - Ifax,Jan 21 2020,"MOSCOW, Jan 21 () - The government of Russia's Yakutia region, which has a stake in diamond producer Alrosa , has proposed the company sell rough diamonds worth $0.5-$1 billion to the precious metals and gems repository Gokhran in 2020, Interfax news agency reported. Diamond miners are battling falling demand, as well as competition from diamonds manufactured in laboratories. Alrosa is the world's largest producer of rough diamonds in carat terms. Together with Anglo American's De Beers unit, it produces about half of the world's rough diamonds. The proposal was made to President Vladimir Putin and Russia's finance ministry, which is responsible for Gokhran within the government, Interfax quoted Aysen Nikolaev, the head of Yakutia region, as saying on Tuesday. “We are raising the issue of purchasing up to $1 billion. Almost a quarter of (Alrosa's annual production). But there are different options - from $500 million to $1 billion. Any option suits us,” Nikolaev, also first deputy chairman of Alrosa's board of directors, said in an interview with Interfax. “Perhaps, it makes sense (for Alrosa) not to sell them for several years before demand recovers, but to sell them to Gokhran, as was done in the late 2000s,” Nikolaev said. Gokhran bought diamonds worth $1 billion from Alrosa during years of weak demand caused by the global financial crisis in 2008-2009. If approved by the finance ministry and the government, the proposal would require a sharp increase in Gokhran's current 2020 budget for purchases as it is limited to 10.5 billion roubles ($170 million). The Yakutia region, Alrosa's management and the finance ministry agreed to review the idea in detail after Alrosa's first-half sales, Nikolaev said. Alrosa has not replied to a  request for comment.

German energy shift will be like 'open-heart surgery': economy minister,Jan 21 2020,"BERLIN () - Germany's transition to a fossil-fuel free energy mix will be like undergoing “open-heart surgery” as the car, steel and renewable industries will need to work hard to stay competitive, its economy minister said on Tuesday. The German government has spurred Europe's largest economy to shift to volatile renewable energy sources like wind and solar power in the wake of its decision to end nuclear power by 2022 and exit coal-fuelled power sources by 2038. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said Germany could in the meantime use natural gas as a transition fuel, tap into intra-European Union power sharing, and develop a green hydrogen-based economy that will offer energy storage and enable industry to work sustainably. “We have to keep fighting for our competitiveness,” Altmaier told an annual energy summit of government and industry leaders hosted by newspaper Handelsblatt. Germany's efforts to wean itself off nuclear energy and coal could be an export model going forward, he said. “Climate protection and competitiveness are not a contradiction,” he said. The national hydrogen strategy will take shape shortly and may be presented within seven to eight weeks, he said, adding that this was especially important for steelmakers whose enormous CO2 emissions needed to come down in a cost-efficient way. “It is important that we have an idea of how the energy shift can be implemented, regardless of the economic situation,” he said. “It is like an open-heart surgery.” German energy customers have to pay roughly 25 billion euros  ($28 billion) in green energy surcharges a year to fund the expansion of wind and solar, drawing criticism from industry figures. Johannes Teyssen, chief executive of German energy firm E.ON, called on the government to cut the 25 billion euro bill that retail power clients and small enterprises have to pay each year for Germany's renewable expansion. “Close the chapter on ill-fated green energy financing here and now. Take the surcharge burden off citizens and companies,” Teyssen said at the summit. Last week, Germany pledged 40 billion euros to pay for an early shutdown of coal-fired power generation. Altmaier defended a brand new exit plan for phasing out domestic brown coal mining and an exit from hard coal burning, both of which are expected to come by 2038 at the latest after environmentalists said Germany should abandon coal sooner. An exit from imported hard coal is being planned, which would aim to mostly stop using this energy source by the end of the decade. Altmaier said that a departure from coal could be accelerated, referring to arranged checks on the scheme in 2026 and 2029. Reiner Blaschek, who heads the German flat steel business of ArcelorMittal, the world's top steelmaker, said the company was testing processes to cut carbon emissions at its blast furnaces in various European countries including France, Belgium and Germany. This entailed green hydrogen uses instead of traditional, natural-gas based processes, gas-capture, and using fermented bacteria to produce green ethanol, he said, adding there were still enormous challenges. It was clear that to turn heavy manufacturing electric, huge volumes of green power were needed, for example to feed them in electrolysis capacity to produce hydrogen as a primary energy input.

Macron and Trump declare truce in digital tax dispute,Jan 21 2020,"PARIS () - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday he had a “great discussion” with U.S. President Donald Trump over a digital tax planned by Paris and said the two countries would work together to avoid a rise in tariffs. The two leaders agreed to the truce after Paris offered to suspend down payments for this year's digital tax and Washington promised to keep negotiating toward a solution rather than acting on a tariff threat, French sources said.  Specifically, Macron and Trump agreed to hold off on a potential tariff war until the end of 2020, a French diplomatic source said, and to push ahead with broader negotiations at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to rewrite the rules of international taxation during that period. “They agreed to give a chance to negotiations until the end of the year,” the source said. “During that time period, there won't be successive tariffs.” France decided in July to apply a 3% levy on revenue from digital services earned in France by companies with revenues of more than 25 million euros ($28 million) in France and 750 million euros worldwide.  Washington threatened to impose trade tariffs on French Champagne, handbags and other goods in response. It complained the tax unfairly targeted U.S. internet companies, a claim Paris dismissed. French authorities have repeatedly said any international agreement on digital taxation reached within the OECD would immediately supersede the French tax. But concerned that the United States would snub the OECD negotiations and proceed with tariffs on French goods, France has offered to suspend until the end of the year down payments on its digital tax that would have been due in April. “What we're proposing is to give ourselves time and to show our goodwill, to postpone the remaining payments to December,” a French Finance Ministry source said. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are due to negotiate the details in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, the source added. The White House said on Monday both Trump and Macron agreed it was important to complete the negotiations successfully. Nearly 140 countries are to meet at the OECD at the end of the month to give their backing for the biggest rewrite of international tax rules since the 1920s, to bring them up to date for the digital era.

Sterling rallies after UK jobs growth weakens case for rate cut,Jan 21 2020,"LONDON () - Sterling gained on Tuesday after the British economy created jobs at its strongest rate in nearly a year in the three months to November, potentially undermining the case for a Bank of England interest rate cut next week. The pound rose as much as 0.3% to $1.3050, up from around $1.3010 before the data was released. Against the euro,  sterling also added 0.3% to 85.04 pence. Money market expectations for a 25 basis point rate cut fell slightly to around 62%, from around two-thirds earlier in the day. Tuesday's reading showed the number of people in employment rose by 208,000 to 32.90 million, the biggest increase since the three months to January 2019 and much stronger than the median forecast in a  poll for a rise of 110,000. Excluding bonuses, which smooth out some volatility, the data also showed that pay growth slowed a touch to 3.4% annually in November, the slowest since the three months to April 2019. Economists had expected regular pay to grow by 3.4%, although with low inflation earnings are rising in real terms. Three BoE policymakers have recently said that more stimulus might be needed including a cut to rates to boost a flagging economy, although many analysts say policymakers could hold off if data shows an economic rebound in December following the general election. Purchasing Managers Index surveys on Friday will provide a clue as to whether that rebound occurred. “Risk reward is not in favour of chasing GBP lower into a rate cut: With the BoE rate cut priced with a 66% chance, the risk reward is that they delay their decision until later this year to evaluate how the data and fiscal stimulus plays out. GBP/USD would naturally head higher as a result,” Nomura analyst Jordan Rochester said. Nomura advises a long position on the pound via a two-month option. Some analysts think the pound looks on shaky ground, however. “Sterling remains vulnerable in the short term, given positioning,” Kit Juckes, an analyst at Societe Generale said, referring to the net long position speculators have built up in the pound this year. On Monday sterling fell to as low as $1.2962 after UK finance minister Sajid Javid said at the weekend that Britain would not commit to sticking to European Union rules in post-Brexit trade talks.

Philippines says Chevron unit underpaid rent for oil terminal lot,Jan 21 2020,"MANILA () - The Philippines said on Tuesday a lease contract between a unit of Chevron Corp and a state-run firm was “grossly disadvantageous” to the government, after a review showed the energy company had been paying a “minuscule” rent. President Rodrigo Duterte ordered a review of all government contracts last year, in a bid to ensure such deals with firms and other countries were fair and favorable to the public. Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez said Chevron Philippines Inc had been paying the state-run firm only a fraction of the fair market rent for an industrial lot hosting the energy company's oil import terminal. The lease deal is “another government contract with onerous provisions,” Dominguez said in a statement. He added that the government's determination came after it compared the lease terms with fair market value of the industrial lot in Batangas, south of the capital, Manila. Government figures showed that since 2010, Chevron Philippines has been paying only 4% of an annual rent that would amount to 257.76 million pesos ($5 million) if it were based on fair market prices. “We have to implement a totally transparent method of getting the best deal for the rental of all government property,” Dominguez added, but stopped short of saying what action the government would take to recover lost revenue. Chevron Philippines, which has nearly 700 service stations in the country, did not immediately comment.

NBG swaps Greek govt bonds with new 30-year bond issue,Jan 21 2020,"ATHENS, Jan 21 () - National Bank (NBG), Greece's second-largest lender, swapped government bonds worth about 3.8 billion euros  ($4.22 billion) with a new 30-year government bond, the finance ministry said on Tuesday, yielding a capital gain for the bank. The swap reduces the government's refinancing risk as bonds maturing in 5.4 years were exchanged for a new issue maturing in 2050. “The exchange helps to further improve the sustainability of public debt, both in terms of debt-to-GDP as well as annual gross funding needs as a percentage of GDP,” the ministry said. The three government bonds NBG swapped for new government paper of equal value had an average coupon of 3.5%. They were exchanged for 30-year government paper paying a coupon of 3.25%.

EU ombudsman probes 'revolving door' at banking watchdog,Jan 21 2020,"LONDON () - The European Union's ombudsman has opened an investigation into how the EU's banking regulator approved a move by its executive director to become head of a top banking lobby. The European Banking Authority (EBA) said in September that its executive director, Adam Farkas, was resigning to become chief executive of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME). EBA put in place several conditions, including an 18-month ban on Farkas advising AFME and its members on topics directly linked to his work during his three years at EBA. The AFME declined to comment. Farkas could not immediately be reached for comment. But some EU lawmakers said the conditions were too lenient for what they described as another example of a “revolving door” that allows EU officials to end up in lucrative private-sector jobs too easily. “The inquiry is based on a complaint from the organization Change Finance, which argued that the Executive Director's move to the Association for Financial Markets in Europe will create conflicts of interest,” the ombudsman said in a statement on its website. In a letter dated Jan. 16 to EBA's chair, former Santander banker Jose Manuel Campa, the EU ombudsman sets out a series of questions for the watchdog to answer, including when and how did Farkas become aware of the job opportunity at AFME. It also asked why Farkas appeared to remain a board member of a sister EU watchdog, the European Securities and Markets Authority, after tending his resignation at EBA.  “As to the Ombudsman's decision to open an investigation into Adam Farkas' move to AFME, of course we acknowledge this decision and remain committed to cooperating with them and replying to their enquiry,” EBA said on Tuesday. Change Finance lobbies to end “casino” banking and to press the financial sector to invest more in socially and ecologically sustainable activities. The ombudsman conducts inquiries into cases of alleged maladministration by EU institutions, though it has no powers to make its rulings binding. Gerry Cross has been nominated to replace Farkas at EBA. He is currently a regulatory policy official at the Central Bank of Ireland and, between 2011 and 2015, was head of lobbying at AFME.

Franklin Templeton's Zahn short British gilts as fiscal expansion looms,Jan 21 2020,"LONDON, Jan 21 () - Franklin Templeton's head of European fixed income David Zahn said on Tuesday he has moved to a ‘short' position in UK government bonds, given expectations the government will ramp up spending at the next budget. British finance minister Sajid Javid, who will deliver the first post-Brexit budget plan on March 11, has promised to use public investment to help the voters who gave Prime Minister Boris Johnson a thumping election win last month. “We've gone short gilts versus Europe,” said Zahn, who last year had bought gilts as a hedge against Brexit uncertainty. “When the UK brings out its budget, we think it will be expansionary, especially vis-a-vis Europe.” Yields on British government bonds, known as gilts, have fallen sharply this month on speculation that the Bank of England is gearing up to cut interest rates, possibly even at its Jan 30 meeting. But data on Tuesday showed the British economy created jobs at its strongest rate in nearly a year in the three months to November, pushing up sterling and gilt yields .

Sterling resists the weight of UK rate cut speculation,Jan 21 2020,"LONDON () - The swift repricing of short-dated UK interest rate futures has sent bond yields plunging but barely moved sterling, which is still holding out hopes of a post-election, post-Brexit inward investment bounce that will lift the pound in time.     On Jan. 9, money markets saw just a 20% chance of an interest rate cut this month. But by Jan. 17, dismal UK growth and inflation readings from late 2019 and a series of speeches from Bank of England chief Mark Carney and at least three of his policymaking colleagues pushed those easing expectations to 70%. (Graphic: UK economic growth weakest since 2012 in November: ) (Graphic: Money markets price UK interest rate cut: ) Gilt markets responded with a roughly 25 basis point fall in yields. But sterling, which would typically weaken on the prospect of lower rates, slipped by less than 1%.  “We do not often see such a dichotomy between gilts and sterling,” said Neil Jones, head of hedge fund sales at Mizuho. “The explanation would lie in the gilt market focusing heavily upon interest rate expectations while the pound ... is also looking at other factors such as longer-term investor inflows.”  Bullish sterling bets rose to 21-month highs in the week to Jan. 14, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and speculators are now substantially net ‘long' of pounds. Derivatives markets also show little sign of worry — for the first time since October, there's an implied volatility premium to buy one-month sterling ‘calls' over puts — options conferring the right to buy and sell, respectively. GBP1MRR=FN (Graphic: Sterling risk reversals: ) Sterling remains sensitive to developments following Brexit on Jan. 31, however, while Carney's replacement as central bank governor by Andrew Bailey next month is another source of potential uncertainty.  The pound relapsed below $1.30 on Monday after comments by finance minister Sajid Javid revived fears that Britain and the European Union will not have agreed a trade deal before the post-Brexit transition period expires at year-end. It has recovered since.  Investors have mostly shunned Britain since the 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU, pulling around $30 billion from UK shares, according to EPFR data, while firms borrowing on bond markets have been saddled with a ‘Brexit premium'.  Direct investment from abroad dropped 6% last year, United Nations data showed on Monday, after a 36% plunge in 2018. But relief that Brexit is happening with a political agreement in place and commitment to talks on a trade deal is encouraging hopes of some rebalancing toward UK assets within international portfolios.  A rate cut would lift those assets further, offsetting the impact on sterling.   What's more, the March 11 budget should bring some big fiscal stimulus. The government has pledged the largest public services spending increases in 15 years, with plans to spend 3% of annual output on infrastructure, almost double historical averages. “Even if the BOE cuts rates, fiscal policy will be supportive and that suggests upside for sterling,” said Sarah Hewin, chief Europe economist at Standard Chartered, who expects the BOE to cut next week then stop.  She noted that the data which drove the money market shift — growth, inflation and retail sales — were from before Dec. 12's election, so would not reflect the upticks registered by some post-election surveys on business confidence and housing. Flash January Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) readings on Friday will be the first significant indicator of business sentiment after the election. “The broader theme is yes, the BoE may cut but this ought to be enough to allow the economy to stabilise,” Hewin added.  Some argue that gilts reacted to a clearly dovish signal from policymakers who had until now mostly implied rates could move either way. That left short-dated yields more or less tracking the 0.75% Bank Rate, said Marc Ostwald, global strategist at ADM Investor Services.  “The adjustment in the gilt curve is all about having somewhat greater clarity on where rates are likely to go over the next six to 12 months,” Ostwald said. Sterling has meanwhile been the main Brexit barometer, he said, with the possibility of crashing out of the EU keeping the currency languishing well off pre-referendum levels of $1.50. On a “real” basis too — against the currencies of Britain's trade partners — sterling remains below its long-term average. Fair value is around $1.40, Hewin reckons. (Graphic: Sterling cheap on a historical basis: ) Of course, the build-up in ‘long' positions makes sterling vulnerable should data, BOE signals or trade headlines disappoint.  UK economic surprises, reflected by a Citi index, are already the most negative since August, contrasting with positive momentum almost everywhere else.  (Graphic: UK remains outlier in economic surprises rebound: )  Ned Rumpeltin at TD Securities expects a sober reassessment to dull sterling's election-led cheer.  “While we are quick to note that the relationship between rates and currency has diminished greatly in recent months, we do not think sterling can completely ignore the BoE's monetary policy cues for much longer,” he told clients.

"Tunisia's designated PM vows to tackle economic, social ills",Jan 21 2020,"TUNIS () - Tunisia's new designated prime minister Elyes Fakhfakh said he would form a smaller cabinet than in previous governments and combat poverty and marginalization of poorer regions.  President Kais Saied named the former finance and tourism minister as his choice for premier on Monday, giving him a month to form a government that can win majority support in the deeply fragmented parliament.  Speaking late on Monday, Fakhfakh said his cabinet would try to meet the aspirations of the 2011 revolution that introduced democracy, citing the October election of Saied as evidence Tunisians wanted big change.  “We will work... to establish the conditions for a fair and strong state, a state that will reward weaker regions and weaker neighborhoods and end decades of poverty and marginalization,” he said.  The economy has languished since the revolution, with low growth, high state deficits and debt, mounting unemployment and declining public services that have caused many Tunisians to lose faith in politics.  “We will focus all our forces on raising the priority challenges, social and economic, and strengthening democracy,” he added.  Tunisia needs to borrow about $3 billion internationally in 2020 to meet spending commitments, and faces strong pressure from international lenders to cut spending.  Addressing Fakhfakh in published comments, Saied said: “Remember the martyrs. Heed the cry of the unemployed and the cry of the poor”.  Saied named the former Total employee after the parliament this month rejected a government proposed by Habib Jemli, who was designated prime minister in November.  Jemli was nominated by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party, a member of successive governments since the revolution, after it came first in the October elections with 53 of the 217 seats.  However, he was not able to win enough support from other parties for his proposed cabinet, giving President Saied the opportunity to designate his own choice for premier.  His selection of Fakhfakh came despite the wishes of most parties in parliament, which showed more support for two other candidates. He now has a month to form a government and put it to a confidence vote. If he loses, there will be another election.  ","{'neg': 0.11, 'neu': 0.742, 'pos': 0.148, 'compound': 0.9409}",0.9409
Talks on tech tax with U.S. still difficult: France's Le Maire,Jan 21 2020,"BRUSSELS () - Talks between France and the United States on taxing digital companies “remained difficult”, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Tuesday, despite a pledge by the two countries to avoid a trade war until at least the end of this year. Le Maire said France's target was still to impose a minimum tax rate on companies that at the moment pay no levies or too little, in line with a proposal put forward last year by the Organisation for the Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). As talks at international level failed to make quick progress, France decided in July to apply a 3% levy on revenue from digital services earned in France by firms with revenues of more than 25 million euros ($28 million) in France and 750 million euros worldwide.  As many of those firms are U.S. companies, Washington has threatened to impose taxes on key French products in response. The U.S. Trade Representative's office said last month the French tax was “inconsistent with prevailing principles of international tax policy, and is unusually burdensome for affected U.S. companies,” including Alphabet Inc's Google, Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc. But in a surprise move on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron said he had a “great discussion” with U.S. President Donald Trump over the issue and said the two countries would work together to avoid a rise in tariffs until the end of 2020. Le Maire said the truce agreed by the two presidents was a “very positive starting point” but now Paris and Washington had to reach a compromise on how to tax digital activities at global level. He said he would discuss details of a possible “definitive” deal with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “It remains a difficult negotiation. The devil is in the details, and on many details we still need to find a common ground, but I think we are moving in the right direction,” Le Maire said in Brussels before a meeting of EU finance ministers where the EU's stance on digital taxation will be discussed. France's objectives in the talks remained to reach a “fair taxation of digital companies and minimum taxation at international level,” Le Maire added.

Market players across the globe were spooked after China reported a fourth death from the flu-like virus on Tuesday as the number of cases continued to rise and China confirmed the new virus could be spread through human contact. A basket of emerging market stocks fell 1.3%, putting it on course for its biggest one-day percentage decline in nearly five months. “The headlines around the virus outbreak in China is the one factor that has been affecting the larger equity market bulls today, particularly more for stocks than currencies,” said William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics in London. China's stocks fell to two-week lows, leading losses among Asian equity markets, while the onshore Chinese yuan also slipped. MSCI's index of emerging market currencies shed 0.5%, with the South African rand leading declines. The currency touched its lowest level since Dec. 12, as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday lowered its growth forecasts for the South African economy in 2020 and 2021, citing structural constraints and deteriorating public finances. “Fiscal possession in South Africa looks particularly fragile especially after the government started to make upward revisions to debt projections late last year,” Jackson said. Africa's most industrialised economy is growing at a snail's pace, with power supply interruptions from struggling state utility Eskom contributing to low business confidence. In Russia, investors are expecting a new cabinet to be named later on Tuesday after the government resigned last week. The rouble traded 0.5% weaker to 61.8875 against the dollar.

Sterling holds steady ahead of crucial labour market data,Jan 21 2020,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019  * Graphic: Trade-weighted sterling since Brexit vote  LONDON, Jan 21 () - Sterling held above $1.30 ahead of UK labour market data on Tuesday that, if disappointing, will provide a further signal that the Bank of England could cut interest rates next week. The pound has fallen in the past fortnight as investors hiked bets on a rate reduction by policymakers keen to boost an economy struggling to grow in recent quarters.

Russian Jehovah's Witness gets suspended sentence for extremism - spokesman,Jan 21 2020,"MOSCOW () - A court in the Russian Far East on Tuesday handed a six-year suspended jail sentence to a Jehovah's Witness, Grigoriy Bubnov, after finding him guilty of extremist activity, a spokesman for the religious group said. Jehovah's Witnesses have been under pressure for years in Russia, where the dominant Orthodox Church is championed by President Vladimir Putin. Orthodox scholars have cast them as a dangerous foreign sect that erodes state institutions and traditional values, allegations they reject. Russia's Supreme Court ruled in 2017 that the group was an “extremist” organization and ordered it to disband, a decision that was followed by a crackdown which has seen dozens of adherents detained and hundreds hit with criminal charges. Prosecutors had asked the court to sentence Bubnov, 54, to seven years in prison, accusing him of organizing the activities of the local Jehovah's Witnesses, something he denied.  Jarrod Lopes, a spokesman for the group, said on Tuesday the court had opted for a suspended six-year jail sentence instead. He said Bubnov would look into appealing. The court could not immediately be reached for comment.

Exclusive: New Indian law to protect foreign investors to exclude tax demands - documents,Jan 21 2020,"NEW DELHI () - New legislation will improve protection for foreign investors in India by offering relief from possible policy changes but will uphold the state's right to tax them, according to its draft and government documents seen by . The bill also attempts to upgrade India's investment climate and boost foreign investment by setting up new adjudicating authorities to swiftly resolve disputes. It is part of India's efforts to become a $5 trillion economy by 2024, from around $2.7 trillion currently, the documents said. But the draft text of the new law dated Nov. 15 does not cover demands related to enforcement of tax obligations, a critical area of concern for foreign investors. Several firms including IBM (), Royal Dutch Shell () and Vodafone () have collectively faced billions of dollars in tax claims from India's government in recent years, leading to arbitration cases and protracted legal battles in courts. A separate internal government document which analyses the draft law noted that taxation issues were of “great interest” to investors and excluding it from the law's purview could reduce the proposal's intent to boost their comfort level. Nevertheless, the document defended the exclusion, saying “the power to tax is an integral part of the state's police powers even recognized in international law”. The Finance Ministry, which drafted the law, did not respond to a request for comment. Two sources familiar with deliberations on the law said it could still undergo several changes before it is finalised. The bill is likely to be presented for passage in the upcoming parliament session that starts Jan. 31, they said. The bill proposes to cover a wide range of foreign investors, including investments from sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and insurance funds, the government document said. One of the most high-profile tax disputes has been India's tussle with Vodafone, which was asked to deposit capital against tax after its $11 billion deal to buy local assets of Hutchison Whampoa in 2007. Though India's Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that Vodafone was not liable to any tax, the government later amended the law to enable it to tax such deals retroactively. Vodafone and India remain locked in international arbitration over the dispute. While the draft law proposes to exclude disputes specific to taxation, it offers to provide “credible commitment to investments” by deterring policy changes, the draft said.  In December 2018, months after Walmart () paid $16 billion to acquire a majority of India's Flipkart, the government tweaked its foreign investment rules for e-commerce, forcing both Flipkart and Amazon () to rework their business structures. The sudden policy change rattled foreign investors.  The draft law stipulates that any new policy or law changes that provide “less favorable” treatment should allow investors to continue enjoying benefits of the earlier policy. “This clause will significantly improve predictability of investment regime and hence will be a significant boost to investments,” read the government document analyzing the draft law. “The investor will have an option of choosing between the new and old policies.” It was not immediately clear whether protection against such sudden policy changes would be permanent or only for a particular period. The proposal also seeks to address concerns about the slowness of India's legal system. It proposes setting up two new bodies to provide swift legal recourse: an Investment Ombudsman who will rule on disputes within 90 days, and an appellate Investment Tribunal which would rule within 180 days. “(This) will eradicate the demand for an international arbitration process as the remedy would be quick, effective and available domestically,” the government document stated. India is entangled in more than 20 overseas arbitration cases - the most against any country - brought by companies including Vodafone and Nissan Motor Co ().

Argentina swaps $1.66 billion of Treasury bills to ease payment crunch,Jan 21 2020,"BUENOS AIRES () - Argentina's economy ministry said on Monday it had exchanged Treasury bills with an original face value of 99.6 billion pesos ($1.66 billion) in a debt swap auction to help push back its repayment schedule amid a wider economic crisis. The ministry held an auction on Monday of the two new peso-denominated bills to holders of five older instruments, on which the government was facing near-term repayments starting in February adding up to around $2.44 billion. The debt swap, part of a larger push to ease a painful debt burden, will see a significant part of those repayments pushed back until Sept. 18 and Dec. 22 when the new bills mature. “We are more than satisfied. We have achieved the three objectives we set ourselves: extending the deadlines; lowering the amount and the rate,” Diego Bastourre, Argentina's finance secretary, told reporters in a briefing. “We were also able to meet another of our goals which was to decompress the timetable for the bills' maturities.” Argentina is looking to restructure its local and foreign debt, which new Peronist President Alberto Fernandez has said the country cannot currently pay while it seeks to revive a stalled economy to raise funds and stave off a default. The new debt will have a nominal value of 83.35 billion pesos ($1.39 billion) with all payments on the debt being due on maturity. The government issued 47.6 billion pesos of the longer 335-day bills and 35.7 billion pesos of the 240-day bills. The new debt maturing in September will have an annual interest rate of the Badlar rate for deposits at private banks in Argentina plus 400 basis points, while the December debt will pay interest of Badlar plus 550 basis points.

Avolon CEO says greener airlines should pay less to lease planes,Jan 21 2020,"DUBLIN () - Airlines with the best environmental scores should pay less for leasing aircraft than more polluting competitors, the head of one of the world's top leasing companies said on Monday. The radical proposal from Dublin-based Avolon comes as aviation firms face mounting scrutiny over climate policies not only from environmental groups but also investment funds that monitor Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance. Avolon, one of the top three aircraft lessors, claims to have one of the industry's youngest and most efficient fleets. “But that narrative is not good enough for the next 1, 2, 3 or 4 years,” Chief Executive Domhnal Slattery warned. “More and more of our major bond investors are keen to understand what our ‘E' strategy is within ‘ESG'. We in turn are keen to understand when underwriting our airline credits what their ‘E' strategy is,” he told . Slattery predicted that lessors, which depend heavily on access to funds to run their capital-intensive businesses, would in future exert more pressure on airlines. “You could see over time that airlines that have a better environmental score could get lower lease rates,” he said. “You could absolutely see that aircraft financiers like us that have a much better ‘E' score from the investors' perspective get tighter priced bonds, so everybody is aligned.” Avolon has not yet put the idea into practice but leasing industry officials say environmental scores or indices for airlines could be on the horizon.  Aviation accounts for 2-3% of greenhouse-gas emissions, and if left unchecked emissions are expected to rise as passengers and flights increase. The industry appears divided on the issue, however. Air Lease Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy, one of the founders of the leasing industry which finances half the world's passenger fleet, said aviation was being unfairly targeted by a “politically driven” climate agenda.  “The media and people who are so fixated on this issue have overblown the damage that the aviation industry is creating to the planet,” he told the Airline Economics conference. Economists say pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and others are showing greater care when investing in companies and have started limiting exposure to oil, gas and coal stocks. Aviation has already halved carbon emissions per traveler, with more fuel-efficient aircraft, while many airlines are trumpeting carbon-offsetting schemes.  But activists say the industry must curb its growth plans to get a handle on the issue.  Several industry officials said aviation needs to improve how it defends itself, arguing that fuel efficiency has improved much faster in planes than in cars.   Aengus Kelly, CEO of no.1 lessor AerCap, said the International Air Transport Association, an airlines group which has taken the lead on the issue, may not have the funding to succeed and another body should possibly take over. “One large U.S. airline was on a roadshow two weeks ago and in the roadshow of 60 minutes to pitch the bond deal, 20 minutes was on ESG. And there was real criticism of the airline for not having a section in their pitch book on ESG from one of the biggest bond investors in the world,” he said. “Its coming. We have to get on the front foot.” ","{'neg': 0.043, 'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': 0.9911}",0.9911
Tunisian president chooses former finance minister to be PM,Jan 21 2020,"TUNIS () - Tunisian President Kais Saied on Monday designated Elyes Fakhfakh as prime minister, a presidency statement said, after the fractured parliament this month rejected a government proposed by an earlier nominee to the post.  The former finance minister now has a month to form a coalition capable of winning a confidence vote in parliament by a simple majority, or there will be another election with urgent economic decisions hanging over the country.  The choice of Fakhfakh, 48, underscores the economic priorities following a decade of low growth, high public debt and declining services since the 2011 revolution that introduced democracy.  Fakhfakh, a former employee of the French energy company Total, served as finance minister in 2012 in the volatile period after the revolution and also worked as tourism minister.  The incumbent government of Youssef Chahed has since 2016 tried to rein in spending while addressing the aftermath of two major militant attacks in 2015 that devastated Tunisia's crucial tourism industry.  However, it has been acting as a caretaker government since the Oct. 6 parliamentary election in which the largest party, the moderate Islamist Ennahda, took only a quarter of the seats.  It nominated Habib Jemli as prime minister in November, but his proposed government failed to win parliamentary backing and lost a confidence vote on Jan. 10.  That meant President Saied, who was also elected in October, had the right to designate his own choice of prime minister to try to form a government.  Tunisia's constitution splits power between the head of state and the government, leading to several periods in recent years of political struggles between them.

Door-knocking neighbors help avert home seizures in Detroit,Jan 21 2020,"WASHINGTON (Thomson  Foundation) - When Delores Orr was going door-to-door helping her Detroit neighbors deal with the effects of one of the nation's worst tax foreclosure crises, she was shocked at how many people didn't know their homes were in danger or what to do about it. As it turned out, that included her. Orr, 72, was working with the Neighbor to Neighbor program when it launched in 2017, joining a group of 450 people who went around their communities to alert homeowners and renters whose property taxes were in arrears. When, as part of the canvassing, she was given a list of properties at risk of foreclosure, she saw her own address among them. “I said, wait a minute, that's my house!” exclaimed the lifelong Detroit resident. The home she and her brother had inherited from their mother, Orr discovered, had come with $3,000 in back taxes they didn't know about. “You would never believe how many people don't know that their taxes were behind,” she told the Thomson  Foundation by phone. For years following the 2008-2009 financial crisis, Detroit had been ravaged by property tax foreclosures, automatically triggered if someone misses their property tax payments for three years in a row. Between 2011 and 2015, a quarter of properties in the city were subject to foreclosure for unpaid property taxes, according to a 2018 study by the Chicago-Kent College of Law and Oakland University.   But foreclosures have fallen by more than 90% since their peak in 2015, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan announced on Jan. 8, pointing to Neighbor to Neighbor as a major player in turning that tide.  While the government was taking its own steps to alert and offer support to residents who were behind on their taxes, the process was confusing and time-consuming, noted community leaders. The biggest innovation in the fight against foreclosures, they said, was simply sending people door-to-door, talking with those at risk. “It's a way of life of being a Detroiter, to hear somebody is losing their house to foreclosure,” said Ray Solomon, general manager for the city's Department of Neighborhoods. “This is a problem that's all hands on deck,” he said in a phone interview. FACE-TO-FACE Still reeling from the decline of the auto industry, Detroit has one of the highest property taxes in the country, which a 2016 study from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a U.S. think tank, found was linked to low property values.  With that has come significant tax delinquency. Citing county figures, Laura Grannemann, vice president of strategic investments with the Quicken Loans Community Fund, which runs Neighbor to Neighbor, noted that Detroit has seen 150,000 tax foreclosures over the past 15 years. That is “an extraordinary drain on homeownership,” she said. In Detroit, as in many cities, programs already existed to shield the most vulnerable from losing their homes to unpaid taxes. But many say the various forms of government support were not widely discussed and were complicated to apply for. “It wasn't largely advertised, so you had to be in the know,” said Tracy Smith, a program manager with the Central Detroit Christian Community Development Corporation, a non-profit and Neighbor to Neighbor partner. And those who did find out often were already facing foreclosure, meaning they had already missed two or three years of tax payments and likely owed significant interest on that amount, she added over the phone. According to Grannemann, the idea behind Neighbor to Neighbor was both simple and desperate: make face-to-face contact with owners or tenants of all Detroit properties with delinquent taxes, well in advance of that dangerous third year. “We realized no one had gone door-to-door and asked people what their experience was,” she said. Armed with delinquency information from the public record, canvassers such as Orr spoke to residents about tax exemptions and other potential resources. Grannemann explained that the first Neighbor to Neighbor census saw people comb the streets for four months between 2017 and 2018, eventually contacting residents at all 60,000 properties that were chronically behind on their taxes.  The program did the same last year and is planning another census for this spring, she added. In its first census, Neighbor to Neighbor found that about 75% of the residents contacted that year qualified for exemptions, meaning they should not have been paying property taxes in the first place. Renters were the most vulnerable, the program found, with almost three-quarters of those contacted not knowing that the owners of the homes they were renting had not been paying taxes — and that they were at risk of eviction. Since the program started, Neighbor to Neighbor has been working with the city to enable renters in that situation to pay off the properties' back taxes and even purchase the home themselves. In 2018, more than 500 renters ended up buying their homes through this initiative, Grannemann said. That year alone, the program helped more than 4,300 families avoid foreclosure, according to the latest data available. The program organizers also worked with local officials to streamline the applications processes for tax exemptions. Official data revealed that more than 7,600 Detroit residents took advantage of tax exemptions last year, up 30% from the previous year. Working with the program is helping the city get ahead of the foreclosure crisis, said Chelsea Neblett, a manager with the city's Financial Empowerment Center, which gives free financial counseling to residents. “For a long time we were reactionary, assisting people in immediate danger,” she said by phone, noting that the city is also coming up with its own solutions for vulnerable residents. Neighbor to Neighbor is “allowing us to become more proactive.” Property taxes are rising in cities across the country and tax delinquency disproportionately affects minority households, said Alanna McCargo, vice president of housing finance policy at the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank. Efforts to resolve the problem should be a “top priority, so that foreclosure doesn't happen,” she said in emailed comments. Grannemann of the Quicken Loans Community Fund said other cities are taking notice of the Neighbor to Neighbor program, and she and her colleagues have been in contact with local officials elsewhere to try out similar strategies. For Orr, meanwhile, the discovery that she might lose her house prompted her to panic. But through her work with Neighbor to Neighbor, she learned that she qualified for a full tax exemption going forward. She is now almost finished paying off the back taxes, and her daughter found out in December that she is likewise exempt. “It allowed me to breathe,” Orr said.

MOVES-JPMorgan targets mid-size companies in Japan expansion,Jan 21 2020,"NEW YORK, Jan 20 () - JPMorgan Chase & Co is launching a new effort to be the international bank for mid-sized companies in Japan, the latest Asia market where the U.S. bank seeks to challenge its international rivals. For the past year, the bank has been meeting prospective clients and recruiting staff for a new corporate client banking & specialized industries (CCBSI) group, a division within its commercial bank that serves medium-sized international companies and their subsidiaries worldwide. The formation of the new 4-person team in Japan comes months after the bank expanded its CCBSI team in India, and it is a sign that the largest U.S. bank is using its vast resources to win more corporate clients that have international ambitions. “Global corporates need global capabilities, with local expertise,” Andrew Kresse, head of corporate client banking & specialized industries for international banking, said in an email to . “As a global bank, we're able to grow with them.” The bank said it hired Shotaro Akita to lead the CCBSI group and also the commercial bank in Japan. Akita joins JPMorgan from Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co, where he worked for 12 years handling mergers and acquisitions and corporate financing. Working with Akita are Toshiyuki Okuyama and Masato Sato, who will serve as senior bankers on the team, and Hideki Hiramatsu, who will handle treasury services. Hiramatsu joins JPMorgan from Standard Chartered Bank's Tokyo Branch. Okuyama and Sato join the group from other positions within JPMorgan. The team will primarily handle banking services like global cash and risk management, as well as strategic advice on credit foreign exchange, trade and treasury services.

EU to add vetting of climate results to fiscal monitoring,Jan 21 2020,"BRUSSELS () - The European Commission will this year begin to assess the green transition of EU states as part of its monitoring of national budgets, a top official said, in a new sign of the bloc's commitment to meet ambitious climate goals. The commission is responsible for making sure member countries do not overspend public resources. It annually assesses whether governments' spending, revenues and investments are reasonably balanced and do not excessively flout debt and deficit ceilings set in EU rules. Worried that environmental and other climate-related costs could worsen governments' fiscal positions, the commission will now also check the pace of governments' transition toward a carbon-neutral economy by 2050. “For the first time in the commission's economic monitoring of national budgets we will have a green variable, which is very important,” EU economics commissioner Paolo Gentiloni told reporters. He said European finance ministers would discuss the matter at meetings in Brussels that were underway and would continue on Tuesday. “It's a change of perspective. When we assess budgets we need to look at expenditures, investments, but also at the results and pace of the green transition,” he added. It is unclear how this new attention to the fiscal impact of climate policies could change the way Brussels puts pressure on states to correct their fiscal policies. The commission could adopt a more benign approach to countries' investments in renewable energies or other measures to reduce carbon emissions. Low-growth, high-debt Italy is asking for that spending to be allowed even when a country's deficit or debt is already above EU limits. Gentiloni, a former socialist prime minister of Italy who became EU commissioner in December, is heeding that call. But a decision on how to treat green investments has not been made yet, an EU official said. That could come as part of a review of EU fiscal rules that Brussels plans to unveil in February. France, Italy and other southern countries of the bloc are keen to soften the rules, seen by many as excessively rigid and complicated. That could spur growth and favor the green transition, supporters of the move say. But Germany has so far resisted changes, fearing fiscal leeway could unleash uncontrolled spending in some countries and cause financial crises.

Putin sees new government as 'major renewal',Jan 23 2020,"MOSCOW • Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved a new government - which he described as a break with the past - bringing in some fresh faces but retaining many senior ministers. The new government includes a new economy minister and a new first deputy prime minister, but the finance, foreign, defence, energy and agriculture ministers all kept their jobs. The new team was formed on Tuesday, less than a week after Mr Putin unveiled a sweeping shake-up of the political system, which led to the resignation of his ally Dmitry Medvedev as prime minister along with the entire government. Mr Putin went on to pick 53-year-old former tax chief Mikhail Mishustin, who has almost no political profile, as his new prime minister. Mr Putin's wider shake-up, which envisages changing the Constitution, is widely seen as preparing the ground for 2024, when the now 67-year-old is obliged to leave the presidency after occupying the Kremlin or the prime minister's job continuously since 1999. Critics have long said Mr Putin wants to stay on in some capacity after his term ends so that he can continue to wield power over the world's largest nation - and one of its two biggest nuclear powers. Tuesday's new appointments could be intended to reboot the government's flagging image and shift attention to Mr Putin's drive to lift falling real incomes and push ahead with big national infrastructure projects which he hopes will catapult his country into a new economic league. ""The most important task is to increase the welfare of our citizens and strengthen our statehood and the position of our country in the world,"" Mr Putin told the new government.

South Korean economy ends bad year with stronger-than-expected growth,Jan 23 2020,"SEOUL • South Korea's economy finished its slowest year of growth since the global financial crisis with a spurt that suggests the worst may be over for the Asian bellwether of global tech trade. Gross domestic product expanded in the fourth quarter at its fastest pace since 2017, the Bank of Korea (BOK) said yesterday. The stronger-than-expected growth was fuelled by an aggressive spending push by President Moon Jae-in's government and a jump in factory investment that included spending on equipment for making semiconductors. While government spending has been a critical prop for the South Korean economy last year, the improved facilities investment adds to other signs out of South Korea that a tech industry slump may be bottoming, a potential positive sign for Korean and global growth this year. South Korea's economy grew 1.2 per cent from the previous three months in the final quarter, almost twice as fast as economists' forecast of 0.7 per cent. On an annual basis, the economy expanded 2 per cent, for its weakest growth since 2009. ""Overall it's looking up after bottoming out,"" said HI Investment & Securities economist Park Sang-hyun. The quarterly growth was helped by an extra government budget approved in summer to help counter a prolonged export slump that has hit the economy hard.

South Korea economy ends bad year with unexpected growth spurt,Jan 22 2020,"SEOUL () - South Korea's economy finished its slowest year of growth since the global financial crisis with a spurt that suggests the worst may be over for the Asian bellwether of global tech trade. Gross domestic product expanded in the fourth quarter at its fastest pace since 2017, the Bank of Korea said on Wednesday (Jan 22). The stronger-than-expected growth was fueled by an aggressive spending push by President Moon Jae-in's government and a jump in factory investment that included spending on equipment for making semiconductors. While government spending has been a critical prop for the South Korean economy during 2019, the improved facilities investment adds to other signs out of South Korea that a tech industry slump may be bottoming, a potential positive sign for Korean and global growth this year. South Korea's economy grew 1.2 per cent from the previous three months in the final quarter, almost twice as fast as economists' forecasts for 0.7 per cent. On an annual basis the economy expanded 2 per cent, for its weakest growth since 2009. ""Overall it's looking up after bottoming out,"" said Park Sang-hyun, an economist for HI Investment & Securities. The Kospi index rose after the report, gaining 0.3 per cent, while other regional equities benchmarks dropped on concern over the spread of a deadly flu virus from China. The quarterly growth was helped by an extra government budget approved in summer to help counter a prolonged export slump that has hit the economy hard. President Moon's economic policy, which includes a drive to raise the minimum wage, is intended to stoke domestic demand and wean the economy off its dependency on trade.

Employers seek help in Budget to defray older workers' costs,Jan 22 2020,"Employers are calling on the Government to provide wage offsets in this year's Budget measures to help businesses cope with the raising of the statutory retirement and re-employment ages as well as Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution rates for older workers over the next two years.Joanna Seow The Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) said yesterday it is proposing that the Government help defray the employment costs associated with hiring older workers, similar to the Special Employment Credit scheme which expires at the end of this year. This scheme provides employers with wage offsets of up to 8 per cent of monthly pay for Singaporean workers aged 55 and above and earning up to $4,000. An additional offset of up to 3 per cent is available for employers that hire older workers turning 67 and above. SNEF also proposed transitional one-off wage offsets for employers to mitigate the higher CPF contribution rates, which kick in on Jan 1 next year. CPF contribution rates for those aged 55 to 70 will be raised gradually over this decade until those aged 60 and below enjoy the full CPF rates. The retirement age will also be raised from 62 now to 63 from July 1, 2022, and eventually to 65 by 2030. The re-employment age will be raised from 67 now to 68 from July 1, 2022, and eventually to 70 by 2030.

ComfortDelGro gets OCBC green loan for hybrid buses in Australia,Jan 22 2020,"ComfortDelGro's Australian subsidiary has secured a A$25 million (S$23.1 million) green loan from OCBC Bank to finance its hybrid bus fleet in Victoria, the transport giant announced in a media statement yesterday. The loan was structured according to the green loan principles issued in 2018 by the Loan Market Association and Asia Pacific Loan Market Association. Proceeds from the green loan will be used to purchase 50 hybrid buses. Delivery of these environmentally friendly buses has begun, with the last batch of buses expected in mid-2022, ComfortDelGro said. These low-floor buses will feature Volvo's parallel hybrid driveline and meet Euro VI emission standards. According to ComfortDelGro, tests have shown that the Volvo hybrid driveline reduces nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions by up to 50 per cent, and lowers fuel consumption by as much as 39 per cent in mixed traffic. The company said the hybrid buses consume 30 per cent less fuel and are quieter when idling at and departing from stops. Mr Yang Ban Seng, managing director and group CEO of ComfortDelGro, said sustainability considerations are at the core of its business strategy, and the loan is another milestone following the group's inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index last September. Separately, the loan also expands OCBC Bank's sustainable finance portfolio to the transportation sector, and is in line with the lender's goal of building a $10 billion sustainable finance portfolio by 2022.","{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.942, 'pos': 0.03, 'compound': 0.1531}",0.1531

"Macron, Trump may have tariff truce in 2020 digital tax fight",Jan 21 2020,"PARIS () - Presidents Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump agreed to a truce in their dispute over digital taxes that will mean neither France nor the US will impose punitive tariffs this year, a French diplomat said. ""Great discussion with @realDonaldTrump on digital tax,"" Mr Macron said Monday (Jan 20) in a tweet. ""We will work together on a good agreement to avoid tariff escalation."" Mr Trump, on Twitter, responded ""excellent!"" to Mr Macron's post, without providing any more details. Mr Trump is en route to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum (WEF). A White House readout of the call was notably more muted, saying only that the ""two leaders agreed it is important to complete successful negotiations on the digital services tax"" and ""discussed other bilateral issues."" And neither a White House spokesman nor officials with the US Trade Representative's office would confirm that the US president had called off his announced tariffs. Still, the possible respite may defuse transatlantic tensions that had been building between Washington and Brussels along another potential trade war front. Last week,   aimed at balancing trade between the world's two largest economies. The European Union is an even bigger US trading partner than China and supply chains between the two economies, particularly in automotive and financial services industries, are intertwined in ways that would make a tit-for-tat tariff dispute even more harmful to the world economy. France and the US will continue negotiations along with their European partners until the end of 2020 to agree a global framework that ensures tech companies pay an appropriate amount of tax, the French diplomat said. Mr Macron's government still hopes to find a solution that fits within discussions at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) work on the issue, the official added, asking not to be identified in line with French government rules. European finance ministers meeting in Brussels Tuesday will discuss progress of the OECD talks. Great discussion with   on digital tax. We will work together on a good agreement to avoid tariff escalation. While the OECD is still working on its proposal for taxing tech companies around the world, France pushed ahead with its own levy last year that hit US Internet giants like Google, Apple and Amazon.com. The US objected, alleging on Dec 2 that the French tax discriminates against American technology companies, citing Section 301 of a 1974 American law that Mr Trump has thus far reserved to justify tariffs against China. That opened the door to the US' threat to hit US$2.4 billion (S$3.23 billion) of French goods with tariffs in retaliation. Among the French products targeted with duties of as much as 100 per cent were luxury items like wine, cheese and makeup. One American wine merchant called it the biggest threat to the industry since Prohibition a century ago. For its part, the French government had warned that the EU would retaliate if the US imposed additional tariffs. The dispute was another headache for European trade officials scrambling to expand their policy arsenal as the US takes aim at a rules-based system for global trade that Mr Trump argues is outdated and tilted against America. It also coincided with a change in leadership at the European Commission, the EU's executive arm. EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan visited Washington last week for the first time in the job, partly to plead for talks rather than tariffs in disagreements like the French digital tax. At stake, he said, was transatlantic trade in goods and services valued at more than US$3 billion a day. ""Sounds like a fairly healthy relationship to me,"" Mr Hogan said Thursday in the US capital. ""So why put tariffs on these EU products to make them more expensive for your people?"" The truce follows weeks of discussions between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who were scheduled to meet Wednesday in Davos, Switzerland, the alpine resort town where government officials and business leaders gather during the winter to discuss whatever is ailing the global economy. US and EU trade relations started to sour in 2018 when the Trump administration invoked national-security considerations to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum from Europe. As a US military ally, the EU was infuriated and promptly retaliated with levies on iconic American brands such as Harley-Davidson motorcycles and Levi Strauss jeans. A subsequent US threat to wreak significantly more economic damage by targeting the European auto industry with duties on the same security grounds led to a hastily agreed truce and a pledge by both sides to work toward reducing industrial tariffs across the board. Since then, the Trump administration has refused to start the tariff-cutting negotiations unless Europe includes agriculture in them. Also, it imposed levies on EU products in retaliation over government aid to Airbus SE that was deemed illegal by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and disabled the WTO's appellate body. The EU, meanwhile, is pressing ahead with a plan for tariffs against the US in a parallel WTO case over unlawful subsidies to Boeing Co. Mr Trump, scheduled to speak Tuesday in Davos at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting, on Sunday reiterated his frustration with Europe as a trading partner. ""Europe has had tremendous barriers to us doing business with them. All those barriers are coming down. They have to come down,"" he told a conference of farmers in Austin, Texas. ""If they don't come down, we're going to have to do things that are very bad for them."" He added, ""Europe was, in many ways, more difficult - and is more difficult - than China.""

Bezos hack claim clouds start of big year for Saudi crown prince Mohammed,Jan 23 2020,"DUBAI () - The incendiary claim that the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia was involved in hacking Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos' mobile phone will refocus critical attention on the controversial young leader just as he was seeking to repair rifts and build for a year in the global spotlight. United Nations experts on Wednesday (Jan 22) called for an investigation into the allegations, first reported by The Guardian. They pointed to information that suggested a possible role for Prince Mohammed, 34, in the surveillance of Mr Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, in an effort to influence the newspaper's reporting on Saudi Arabia and in light of separate claims that the Prince was involved in the 2018 murder of Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. A probe would take time, yet the damage to Saudi Arabia's image the allegations bring could be more immediate, with speculation swirling as the kingdom prepares to host G-20 finance ministers next month. That is one of dozens of events meant to showcase the Prince's economic programme to transform his nation and lure billions in foreign investment ahead of the grouping's main extravaganza in November. The allegations reinforce the existing perception among some ""that he's not a good guy"", said Mr Kamran Bokhari, founding director of the Centre for Global Policy in Washington. People have already made up their mind about Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, and unless he enacts major political reforms, it is unlikely that public opinion will shift in the West, he said. Officials have spent the past year trying to rebuild the country's reputation after Mr Khashoggi's killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. They have won support from US President Donald Trump, who defended the Prince and shielded the kingdom against any major retaliation by US lawmakers. The government pulled off a flagship investment conference in October and then sold an initial stake in its oil giant Aramco against the backdrop of a missile attack that temporarily knocked out its biggest crude processing facility. Riyadh has also attempted to disentangle from regional problems with limited results. It showed openness to talks in a long-running Gulf dispute with Qatar, helped end fighting between two factions that were Saudi allies in the war in Yemen, and sought de-escalation with chief foe Iran, which it blames for the missile strike - rejecting Teheran's denials. A Saudi court sentenced five people to death for the murder of Mr Khashoggi, who had criticised Prince Mohammed's rule in his writing, while three others were given prison terms totalling 24 years in a move designed to close a damaging chapter, at least locally. The kingdom denies that the Prince was involved in the killing and the court cleared his former top aide. ""We have seen in recent months a far more consultative and multi-lateral approach, partly triggered by doubts about US reliability and given the fact of the chairmanship of the G-20,"" said Mr James M. Dorsey, a Middle East scholar at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The hacking report does not help in the rebranding of Saudi Arabia and Prince Mohammed, he said. If Mr Bezos, the world's richest man, can be a target, what about other people doing business in the kingdom? ""If you are a businessman communicating with the Saudis, you are going to become a lot more cautious and ask yourself - am I being monitored?"" Mr Dorsey said. Saudi Arabia has promoted a veneration of the crown prince in an effort to swing nationalist opinion behind his reforms, which have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent at home. On Thursday (Jan 23), a hashtag urging Saudis to boycott Amazon products was trending on Twitter, with users defending Prince Mohammed, suggesting other online shopping companies and posting photos of Mr Bezos sitting next to or hugging Mr Khashoggi's fiancee. In a response to queries citing an unidentified official, Saudi Arabia's information ministry rejected news reports on the Bezos phone breach as ""wholly unsubstantiated allegations,"" and said it doesn't conduct or condone such illicit activities. ""We request the presentation of any supposed evidence and the disclosure of any company that examined forensic evidence so that we can show it is demonstrably false,"" it said on Wednesday. Saudi Arabia is a key US ally in the Middle East and the Trump administration rebuffed talk of the prince's involvement in the Khashoggi murder despite reported CIA findings that he ordered it. Even so, Washington has been pushing Riyadh and other Gulf states to end the nearly three-year diplomatic and trade crisis with Qatar, saying it was playing into the hands of Iran at a time when the US is seeking to weaken the Islamic Republic's miltary and economy. Saudi Arabia had shown an openness to talks with Doha ahead of taking over the G-20 chairmanship in December, raising hopes among Gulf officials of an end to the crisis. Riyadh hosted Qatar's foreign minister late last year to discuss the regional row, but those efforts have since lost momentum, according to three Gulf officials briefed on the discussions who asked not to be named. While the hack reports are seen as denting the kingdom's image, investors are unlikely to pull back, after already weathering the Khashoggi fallout. Some Western companies distanced themselves from the kingdom in the months after his killing - their executives staying away from a 2018 investment conference - but others continued to pour in money. That has continued. The government sold US$5 billion (S$6.8 billion) of debt its first Eurobond offer of the year on Tuesday, with orders worth more than US$23 billion. Several overseas investors in Saudi Arabia said it was too early to gauge the impact of the Bezos claims, but said they were unlikely to change their existing views on the kingdom. Mr Ayham Kamel, head of Middle East and North Africa research at Eurasia Group, a consultancy, said that while individual countries would proceed with the kingdom at their own pace, the trajectory was unlikely to change.","{'neg': 0.079, 'neu': 0.896, 'pos': 0.025, 'compound': -0.9935}",-0.9935

The seven-member Home Ownership Support Team (HST), set up last June, is still in the process of helping the other households, some of which are not ready to apply for a flat as yet. Among those the team has helped is Mr Chua, 46, whose family has selected a three-room build-to-order (BTO) flat. ""I wanted to buy a house but I didn't know the various assistance schemes available. An officer from the HST explained the schemes and guided me through a step-by-step process on preparing the documents to apply for the BTO,"" said Mr Chua, who declined to give his full name. The food and beverage outlet manager has been living in a rented flat in Tampines with his wife and eight-year-old daughter for three years. He will know the results of his BTO application in May.

""We do a holistic assessment of their circumstances, including their financial health, making sure they are employed and that they do not have medical conditions that require a lot of expenses. Most importantly, they have to be keen on buying a house and have the desire to take ownership of the process to buy a house,"" said Ms Tan. The HST has been reaching out to households by calling them, making house visits and putting up posters about the team at the void decks of rental housing blocks. It also works with different social service agencies and partners to help the families address their challenges and achieve better stability, if they are not found to be ready to own a house. The setting up of the HST was announced last year as part of a series of measures to mitigate income inequality and uplift lower-income families in a more holistic way. Prior to its formation, families in rental homes were evaluated on an ad hoc basis, for instance, when they renew their tenancy every two years. The HST aims to reach out to 1,000 rental households over the next few years.

Mr Simon Karaban, the SGX's head of index services, said there has been a shift globally in recent decades to such indices that can be drivers of long-term risk and return. Over 60 asset owners and managers now use Scientific Beta's indices to track or benchmark their investments. There were about US$54.7 billion in assets replicating the firm's indices as of September last year, which represents a growth of more than 10-fold in under four years. SGX managing director Ng Kin Yee, who is also head of data, connectivity and indices, said the abundance of data now available allows investors to use new indices that were previously not possible. ""With technology and the right data, we can develop more creative and sophisticated products. There is even the potential to use these indices to create exchange-traded funds for retail investors."" SGX chief executive Loh Boon Chye said: ""Our latest acquisition is a boost to our growing index business, enhancing our research capabilities to develop products for passive investing, which is trending globally."" Scientific Beta chief executive Noel Amenc added: ""Together we will drive continued development in the smart beta and sustainable finance space, leveraging Scientific Beta's academic rigour and SGX's product development capabilities."" The proposed acquisition will be funded through external borrowings and is not expected to have a material impact on SGX's results in the 2020 financial year. Meanwhile, SGX reported a net profit of $99 million for its second quarter, an increase of 3 per cent over the same period a year earlier.

Australians in wildfire zone face a painful question: Rebuild or leave?,Jan 23 2020,"SYDNEY () - It took two years for Mr Nigel Allison to build his mud-brick house on a sleepy south-eastern tip of Australia, and just hours for it to be gutted by fire. The cherished three-bedroom home built in 1986 was one of several dwellings razed in Mallacoota on New Year's Eve. Wildfires engulfed the coastal town, forcing a naval ship to rescue hundreds of stranded residents and holidaymakers. Across the country, more than 3,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed in the months-long calamity. Now, residents from Sydney's forested urban fringe and country towns like Mallacoota are confronting the reality of what it takes to live safely in the world's driest inhabited continent in an era of climate change. ""As a society, we need to start accepting there are some costs involved if we want to ensure that our houses have a better chance of surviving a bush fire,"" said Mr Chris Wyborn, general manager of education and bush fire services with the Melbourne-based Fire Protection Association Australia. More than five million people in Australia live in areas at high-to-extreme risk of wildfires or severe weather events like cyclones, according to SGS Economics and Planning. The number of people in fire-prone areas increased by 111,000 in Victoria state alone in the decade through 2018, the Melbourne-based research group said in a report last month. Climate change will inevitably increase the number at risk. Last year was the hottest and driest on record, according to Australia's weather agency, creating tinderbox conditions that enabled fires to blacken an area about the size of England. Keep up with the latest in the region with the ST Asian Insider newsletter, delivered to your inbox every weekday By signing up, you agree to our   and  ""Many of these communities are incredibly risky,"" according to Professor Alan March, a professor of urban planning at the University of Melbourne. ""We need to start asking, 'Well, we feel a deep compassion for the people who have lost their homes, but should they rebuild?' This is not a yes or no answer."" Mr Allison, a 62-year-old retired school teacher, and his partner, Ms Liz Girvan, estimate that rebuilding their dream home overlooking the ocean would probably cost A$100,000 (S$92,750)... for the windows alone. ""The window cost is going to be astronomical,"" he said over the phone from the town, where he and Ms Girvan have been offered temporary accommodation from a neighbour. That's not deterring them, though. He said an ""emotional attachment"" to the 1,000-strong community makes them determined to rebuild. The cost is high because planning and building rules have tightened in recent years, requiring more fire-resistant materials. Only about 5 per cent of houses in wildfire-prone areas are new, according to Fire Protection Association's Mr Wyborn. That means many of those looking to rebuild burned homes could find they are under-insured for the cost of meeting the new standards, said Mr Ian Weir, an architect who specialises in the area. Australia grades bush fire risk levels from low to ""flame zone"", with the cost of building in the most dangerous areas increasing by ""an order of magnitude"", said Mr Weir. Homes need to be fortified to commercial-level standards of resilience to withstand the worst threats. Shutters designed to block embers, for example, can cost A$1,000 a square metre, Mr Weir said. They are an important defence since windows can shatter under extreme heat, providing entry points for flying embers that are the principal cause of as many as 85 per cent of homes destroyed in wildfires, according to the Fire Protection Association. In less hazardous areas, building a basic home that meets fire standards doesn't necessarily mean large additional costs, Mr Weir said. However, in risky areas, construction can become ""prohibitively expensive"" when lifestyle features like verandas and decks are added because of the need to use non-combustible materials for structural elements, such as steel, and cladding that is three times the price of the conventional equivalent, he said. For those under- or uninsured, the cost of rebuilding will be a burden for poorer rural communities, according to Prof Andrew Beer, a regional housing and infrastructure professor at the University of South Australia. The impact on household finances will be ""devastating"", he said. Some of these people will be forced to relocate to cities, while others will remain unprotected. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews pledged to waive as much as A$55,000 in taxes for fire-affected residents who elect to buy a home in a new area. Prime Minister Scott Morrison acknowledged last week that the nation must become more resilient to climate change, and proposed a review of the government's response to the wildfire crisis. Mr Morrison, a staunch supporter of the coal industry, didn't make any firm commitment to reducing the country's emissions. The Australian and state governments pledged more than A$3 billion this month to fire relief and recovery efforts. Expenditure on mitigation measures such as land-use planning, hazard-reduction fires, protective infrastructure and building innovation is equivalent to only 3 per cent of that spent in response to the disasters, according to Mr Terry Rawnsley, principal and partner with SGS Economics and Planning. ""Successive governments have over-invested in post-disaster reconstruction and under-invested in mitigation, which would limit the impact of natural disasters,"" he said. ""As a general rule, one dollar spent on mitigation can save at least two dollars in recovery costs."" For Mallacoota resident Mr Allison, that means rebuilding his home on a more costly but less risky spot at the front of his block, further from a potential wildfire, ""making pretty sure that it's not going to burn down again"".","{'neg': 0.098, 'neu': 0.826, 'pos': 0.076, 'compound': -0.9857}",-0.9857

Wirecard to beef up management amid fraud allegations; CEO to stay,Jan 23 2020,"BERLIN () - The new chairman of Wirecard said the German payments company needed to strengthen its top management as it fights allegations of fraud and false accounting, while giving chief executive Markus Braun a vote of confidence. Braun's contract expiring at the end of this year will definitely be extended, Thomas Eichelmann told Manager Magazine in an interview published on Wednesday (Jan 22). Braun, 50, has had a difficult 12 months in which the Financial Times has alleged that   and its finance team conspired to inflate revenue and profit at its subsidiaries in Dubai and Ireland. Outside auditor KPMG was hired last autumn to investigate all the FT's allegations and is expected to report back by the end of the first quarter. Wirecard itself denies wrongdoing. Eichelmann, a former chief financial officer of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange elected chairman in December, said Wirecard needed to beef up both its management and supervisory boards by two members each to ease the burden on Braun. ""A management board member for personnel would make sense in my opinion, as would one for international marketing,"" Eichelmann told Manager Magazine.

World Economic Forum: Pact on Singapore-pioneered framework to foster trust in trade digitalisation,Jan 23 2020,"The adoption of digital technologies in trade and commerce has taken another step forward with the signing of a landmark agreement yesterday.Ovais Subhani The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and 17 major companies from key industries have agreed to develop TradeTrust - a framework to shift world trade from a paper-based system to a digitally enabled one. Pioneered by Singapore, the framework establishes the fundamentals to foster trust in the digitalisation of trade while making sure new rules work in conjunction with the multilateral trading system. The initiative aims to cut back on the reams of paper needed when goods are transported from one part of the world to another. The paper trail invariably makes logistics a slow, inefficient and complex process. ""We believe we must forge new ways to enable trade in the digital era,"" Minister for Communications and Information S. Iswaran said at the Taking Trade Digital session in Davos, Switzerland. Yesterday's event occurred on the sidelines of the 50th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. Mr Iswaran said the TradeTrust initiative is part of Singapore's broader efforts to digitalise trade while establishing clear and harmonised international rules that allow data to flow freely between countries with appropriate safeguards. Those efforts include the substantial conclusion of the first Digital Economy Agreement with Chile and New Zealand announced on Tuesday and ongoing talks with Australia and other countries on similar pacts, he said. Singapore is also the co-convener of the World Trade Organisation initiative to develop baseline digital trade rules. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  The TradeTrust framework will provide a range of features, including ways to validate digital trade documents, an accreditation structure to certify technical solutions and open source codes that can easily integrate back-end solutions to the TradeTrust network. One of the first platforms built on the TradeTrust framework is the ICC TradeFlow - co-developed by the ICC with trade technology firm Perlin, and in collaboration with Singapore's Infocomm Media Development Authority, commodities trader Trafigura and DBS Bank. The ICC's 45 million members worldwide could be among the first to conduct trade more efficiently while still managing risks and having legal certainty and confidence in the trading process, Mr Iswaran said. He noted that a pilot TradeTrust transaction involving an iron ore shipment reduced documentation time from 45 to 20 days. ICC secretary-general John Denton said: ""Digital platforms will lower existing barriers to inter-national trade in the coming years and enable many more businesses to participate in the new global economy.""","{'neg': 0.014, 'neu': 0.873, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': 0.9889}",0.9889
Clashes mark return to protests in Colombia,Jan 23 2020,"BOGOTA • Riot police firing tear gas and stun grenades clashed with rock-throwing demonstrators in Bogota on Tuesday, as anti-government protests resumed across Colombia, leaving 11 people injured and nearly 100 arrested. Protests also took place in other major cities, including Cali and Medellin. Nationwide, the authorities recorded 165 marches, rallies or road blockages, police chief Oscar Atehortua said. Most of the arrests were in Bogota and 10 of the 11 injured were police, he said. The Bogota events started in the late afternoon as a traditional pot-banging demonstration of the kind common in Latin America and late last year when protests first erupted against conservative President Ivan Duque's 17-month-old government. What began as a general strike has morphed into a wider display of discontent over his economic policies, unemployment, political corruption and drug-financed violence. Security forces were still deployed in the old quarter of Bogota as night fell on Tuesday. Mayor Claudia Lopez said the day had been mostly peaceful, although in some neighbourhoods, small groups had turned violent. In the city centre, a 60-year-old woman named Flor Calderon stood between protesters and riot police, asking officers to let the procession move forward. ""This is a fight for you and your children's children because this country is a mess,"" she said to police, waving a white flag. Ms Lopez, who took office on Jan 1, has set up procedures to try to prevent violence at demonstrations, which have left four people dead since they began on Nov 21. About 500 people have been injured and around 200 arrested. Many protesters feel that efforts to end the decades-long armed conflict with the country's Farc rebels have detracted from progress in other areas of society. They also want Mr Duque to dismantle the feared Esmad riot police, widely criticised for its heavy-handed response to demonstrations. Mr Duque has yielded to some of the other demands on tax reform, announcing the refund of value-added tax to the poorest 20 per cent of the population and benefits for companies that hire young people.","{'neg': 0.197, 'neu': 0.757, 'pos': 0.046, 'compound': -0.9953}",-0.9953

Garuda gets new CEO after Harley bike smuggling fiasco,Jan 23 2020,"JAKARTA • Garuda Indonesia has picked former telecommunications executive Irfan Setiaputra as its new president director, after the airline's previous chief executive was fired for allegedly smuggling a classic Harley-Davidson motorcycle on a flight to Jakarta. At an extraordinary general meeting yesterday, shareholders of Indonesia's flag carrier also decided to keep interim chief executive Fuad Rizal as finance director, and chose Mr Triawan Munaf, a former head of the country's Creative Economy Agency, as chairman. Mr Setiaputra, 55, joins from telecoms company Sigfox Indonesia, and was previously CEO of state-owned Industri Telekomunikasi Indonesia. Challenges for the new CEO, who has not worked in the airline industry before, include restoring Garuda's reputation and bringing down high leasing costs: The carrier spends more on aircraft rentals as a percentage of revenue than any of its global peers. ""The appointment of the new CEO for Garuda Indonesia could help remove one of the key uncertainties in the company,"" said Ms Jessica Pratiwi, an analyst at RHB Securities Indonesia. ""Investors and the public are expecting the new leadership to improve corporate governance."" Mr Setiaputra is Garuda's fourth CEO since Mr Emirsyah Satar - who served the company for nearly a decade - stepped down in 2014. Mr Satar was credited with turning the airline around, though he was later arrested for corruption. Garuda went on to report net losses in three out of the five years, up to and including 2018, with about a quarter of revenue spent on aircraft rental, the highest ratio of any airline in the world, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  Mr Gusti Ngurah Askhara Danadiputra was fired as CEO last month. ""Keeping those rental costs in check will be a key priority for the new CEO, along with making sure international routes are profitable,"" said Mirae Asset Sekuritas Indonesia analyst Lee Young Jun. ""The company has been trying to renegotiate contracts with aircraft lessors, but that didn't happen fast enough to bring down costs."" The new management will need a sharper focus on fleet utilisation, according to Mr Gerry Soejatman, an aviation analyst and technical adviser at NeoSky Aviasi Digital. Garuda said it would cancel orders of 49 Boeing 737 Max aircraft, which have been grounded globally since last March, following two deadly crashes - including that of a Lion Air flight that plunged into the Java Sea in 2018. Garuda has not decided how to replace the order, which it booked to succeed its older 737-800 models. Boeing 737 planes account for more than a third of Garuda's fleet and have an average age of 8.1 years, according to the planespotters.net website. Among other planes, the carrier also operates six Airbus A330-300 aircraft received in 1996 and 1997.","{'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.924, 'pos': 0.045, 'compound': 0.5499}",0.5499
PM Lee Hsien Loong's dialogue with WEF president Borge Brende: Strains in US-China ties set to pose uncertainty for some time yet,Jan 22 2020,"DAVOS - Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Wednesday (Jan 22) spoke at a dialogue with World Economic Forum (WEF) president Borge Brende. He shared about how Singapore must keep faith in globalisation, the challenges posed by the United States turning inward and a rising China, and how Singapore plans to navigate its way in a more challenging environment. He also spoke about how technological disruption has created new opportunities, as well as new problems. Here is a transcript of the interview.   Back in 1965, per capita in Singapore was US$500. Today, per capita is US$65,000. That represents around 9 per cent annual growth. You became Prime Minister in 2004, you are the third Prime Minister of your country - also shows the stability. I have been living in the country for 16 years. We know that there are a lot of things happening in the region but this is definitely Asia's century. For the first time, 50 per cent of the global GDP is coming from Asia, and Singapore's leadership is crucial. So I think all the people coming here are looking forward to hearing your views, Prime Minister, on the geopolitical outlook aspirations for Singapore. The floor is yours. Thank you, Brende. Thank you for your very generous remarks on Singapore. We have done reasonably well over the last half century. We worked hard for that but there were some external factors which are very important to us and I will just mention three of them - the United States, China, and globalisation. The US was critical because it generated peace and stability and security throughout the Asia Pacific over this last half century. The Vietnam War, notwithstanding, it has been a benign, constructive influence, generating an environment where countries like Singapore - small ones - can participate, prosper, compete and have our place in the sun. At the same time, the US was also a major source of investments and a major market for us, because they kept their economy open, and they believe that by being open and by being welcoming of the growth and prosperity of others, the US gained. China was also a major factor in our success because over the last 40 years as China reformed, opened up and grew steadily, even faster than Singapore, our engagement with them deepened. Trade volumes increased dramatically, investments in China grew hugely. Singapore, according to the Chinese statistics, is the biggest source of foreign investments in China - through Singapore. I think some of them must be other companies based in Singapore, but nevertheless it shows the depth of the relationship. Tourism numbers grew. The engagement generated confidence, lift and a certain vibrancy throughout the whole region, which Singapore benefited hugely from. Thirdly, we benefited from globalisation because world trade was buoyant and because people did business with one another, became increasingly openly. There were trade rounds, there was a Uruguay Round. The World Trade Organisation played a constructive role although not always effortlessly. But we plugged into the global economy and that enabled a small country to be productive, and so the policies we made could work. Now we are at a turning point, all three of these factors are changing. The US, in terms of security. The strategic balance in the region is shifting because China has become more influential and more substantial a participant, and other countries too - the North Koreans are a major preoccupation because they have nuclear capabilities. America itself is asking the question whether they are carrying too much of a burden for this and wanting their allies to take on more of a responsibility, at least for financing the cost of this common security. On economics too, the Americans have shifted their attitudes. I think that much more concerned about the impact on American workers, much more concerned about other countries taking advantage of America, seeing this as a free rider problem rather than one where America is holding the rein and being open, benefiting others but in the process benefiting itself. So that is a major change, we do not know that it is irreversible but it is certainly a very fundamental shift of stance. The Chinese position has also shifted because as they have grown, they have become much more influential and much more advanced in their development. Their role in the international economy has changed substantially. Their influence has grown and their relations with other countries, in particular with the US, has become more difficult to manage. And therefore, where as it was previously effortless to say, ""I am friends with everybody and including friends with the United States and with China"", now we still want to be friends with everybody but you are pushed to be better friends with one side or the other. So that is a change in the world. The smaller you are, the better you understand it. The third factor - globalisation - is also shifting. You discuss it all the time here because people worry about the impact on disadvantaged groups; people worry about the impact on the environment; people worry about the uncertainties which are generated because we are so interrelated; and people are anxious about the ups and downs, which we no longer have a buffer to protect ourselves against. In this environment, Singapore has looked forward for more than another 50 years, and find a way forward to navigate them. What do we do? With America, we remain very good friends. They are a major security cooperation partner with us. I think we continue to believe that they have an important role in the region to foster stability and security - no longer alone, but still an indispensable role, because the Chinese cannot play the role the Americans do, the Japanese neither. And so we would like to continue to work with America, we would like to continue to work with China. From time to time, you will find yourself being pressed to choose sides. When we do have to make a stand, I think it is very important that people understand that Singapore's choices are on its own behalf because we are making decisions for Singapore and not because we are a cat's paw for one side or the other. That means you must have the courage to stand up and call things as they are, and from time to time you will incur at least a raised eyebrow, and sometimes more than one raised eyebrow from one side or the other, and occasionally both. But it is necessary to do that because once people no longer think that you are a serious interlocutor calculating on your own behalf, you are written off, you are finished. With China, we also have a big account. In fact, China is our biggest trading partner as it is for everybody else in the region, including all of America's allies. We hope that when we see that it is possible for China to adjust its position, taking into account its new very strong influence in the world, in order to integrate in a peaceful and constructive way into the global order, which it depends upon, whether it is through the Belt and Road initiative, whether it is through the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank or other diplomatic initiatives. I think China will have a major role to play and Singapore hopes that we will be able to cooperate with them, participate and encourage them to engage in a way which leaves space for other countries to prosper, to set their own path, and in the long term to welcome a new major player and not feel that this is an elephant in the room, which may not notice who else is there and what may be under foot. On globalisation, I think, notwithstanding the pressures and the problems, we have no choice but to continue to bet on countries cooperating closely with one another. Because if five and a half million or six million people in Singapore have to grow our own food and make our own computers and make our own banking and living, I think we will starve, it is not possible. But to prosper in such a new globalised but troubled environment, we have to up our game, raise our capabilities, bring in new investments which will connect us to centres of vibrancy and prosperity all over the world -Europe, America, Japan, China, Latin America and Africa, because there are many spots of vibrancy and future growth there, and link us in in a way where we make a contribution because we can do things in Singapore, which is not so easy to be done, all together in one place, any other single place. That means we have to upgrade our companies, upgrade our people, education, skills, and have the environment where we can welcome in very high quality investments, operations, R&D centres, places where high quality people want to live, want to work, and want to be. It is not just costs, but it is also the whole environment - safety, security, confidence, opportunities, vibrancy. That is what Singapore needs to be. Amidst all of this, we have to look after our own people, make sure that all these good things, which happen in the world, benefit not just Singapore but benefits Singaporeans across the board. So that they are able to take advantage of the jobs we create, so that they are able to fend for themselves against global competition. So that if one industry is declining which will happen from time to time, the people there are given the help, the support and the time to gain new skills and transfer their employment to another industry, another job and be able to make a living for themselves and not feel that they are fending for themselves on their own and that the system is not on their side. This system has to work for them because if it does not work for them, the system will fail. And in Singapore, it must not fail because we only have one chance to succeed. We are relentlessly optimistic but not that much so. I do not think it has peaked at all. It is a very serious issue. How does an incumbent hyper power like the US accommodate a rising new power - China - which is going to grow as a percentage of the world's GDP, which is going to grow and develop in terms of the sophistication of its economy, and which in absolute size is going to become larger than the US, although not more advanced than the US for many years to come? But it will become larger very soon, if it has not already. How do both sides make the adjustments in order to accommodate each other, and head-off what Graham Allison calls the Thucydides's trap? And it is not at all obvious that it is easy to do because both sides have domestic pressures, both sides are primarily calculating the next election, or the next domestic political succession. Those domestic pressures do not naturally factor in a global strategic stable balance. Already you have seen the consequences because the tariffs and counter-tariffs have reduced trade, reduced welfare and the uncertainty of the conflict has meant that investments have been affected and business decisions are being put up because you do not know and you cannot count on the future. The prospect of bifurcation in technology, whether it is on 5G or on the whole supply chain that will cause ""I don't trust you therefore you don't trust me, therefore I cannot rely on your products and therefore you must develop your own supply chain"". It will take a long time for that process to come, to run its course but it is a very expensive process, which is going to hurt us. I was talking to one industrialist yesterday and he said, ""Well, we may say, medical equipment - MRI machines. In an ideal world, you make it in one place and you supply the whole world. If we bifurcate, we can put one manufacturing centre for Asia and China, one manufacturing centre for America and it costs us and that we will not die."" I said that is fine if you are making the same MRI machine in both places. But if they need different chips and different software, and if the next time I find an MRI breakthrough, I am not going to share with you because that is a national security threat to me, then I think it will cost us. I think you are not there yet, but you are not heading away from that direction.   Today, I am here talking to you and we have two mics for backup and they are both the same system. One day, I may need to have one which is an American system and one which is not an American system. I do not think that is the better world to be in because it is not just that it is going to cost us more but the mutual suspicions and anxieties which are going to be created - did he design his own, did he borrow my design, did he reverse engineer mine or did he entice my person over in order to carry the IP along? All these mutual suspicions and doubts are going to only create more frictions and problems. The optimists say you are going to be so integrated that pulling it apart is unthinkable but I do not take quite such an optimistic view. I think it makes it very hard but such things do happen before and if they do try to happen, the consequences are very bad. In fact, before the First World War, the European countries were all very integrated together. The economies were integrated together, the colonies traded with one another, and people thought this was the future - globalisation. But that did not stop miscalculations and tensions from building up, and the First World War from breaking out disastrously, beginning with what should have been a minor incident. And so, we have had 50 years, generally of peace. Can you bet on another 50 years, generally of peace? I think that the odds are not negligible.    Nobody says that. Everybody says that I want to prosper my neighbour, but I have to think about my people first.    Some of it was from slower trade, export markets were less buoyant, some of it was because of electronics slowdown, which was global. There are some prospects that the electronic slowdown will turn around this year, the people in the industry are reasonably optimistic. What we are not sure this year is where the US economy is going - it does not look like it is going into a recession, but nobody has a very good record predicting when economies go into recession.  I have no doubt, but does that predict the future? You never know. The turning point - when does the mood change and all of a sudden the people's perspective shift and say, how silly of me, why didn't I see this before? By that time, everybody else has got into a new psychology and things turn. It may not happen this year. If you ask the best opinion they say, chances are not, but the chances are not negligible. But the key thing is, if you have the strategic tensions not being resolved and flaring up again downstream, which can happen, then is not just an impact on the business cycle, it is an impact on the long term trajectory of the world.  Well that depends on your view, whether things have turned sour because the relationship has soured or whether they work less well together because the crisis is less urgent. If it is a former and you are going through a crisis, and we are not on good terms, well, we have a problem, we cannot cooperate. But if we are squabbling because things are not grave, then when things become grave and minds are concentrated, perhaps we would have no choice but to work together again. I have to hope so. I do not know whether central bankers have run out of ammunition, they say so. But central banks are not the only policy instrument which governments have. You also have fiscal policy. There are limits, but in fact, there are very respectable and eminent economist like Larry Summers who argued that in the last downturn and in the recovery, fiscal policy was not used enough and people were too worried about running deficits whereas you should have run the deficits, spend the money wisely, not just to feel good or to boondoggle, but to invest in infrastructure, education, things which make a difference, improve your productive capacity, and then the economy will recover and then, in a way, you have got something of a free lunch. I do not generally believe in a free lunch but I do believe there is a role for fiscal policy. Germany, for example, has got a very balanced budget but they have very deep institutional and collective memories of hyperinflation and they do not wish to go in that direction.    Well that is not a bad discipline to impose on ourselves, I mean Singapore has that rule too - not year by year, by term by term of government, namely, that this government, if you are going to run a deficit, you have to first earn the money then the next year you can run a deficit, but you cannot say last term of government ran a surplus and so now I can afford to run a deficit, the country is rich. That is a valuable discipline but you have to apply it in a way which is appropriate to the situation. I think that 2007-08 global financial crisis, in that situation, if you navigate by rules, the chances are you will run into an even more serious problem. Or in the 1930s, because what happened in the 30s was tariffs and counter-tariffs and Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in America. One of the things that the G20 did after the global financial crisis was to say, we shall not go for this talent retaliation or competitive devaluation, and we shall be in this together and let us try to reflate together, let us bring our monetary policy down and try and coordinate that. You do need that kind of coordination worldwide. We cannot all be running trade surpluses. Whom are we going to be having surpluses against? Antarctica? Followed by a war. There is a lot at stake. I mean I do not think we will repeat follies in the same way but it is quite possible for us to be inventive in making new mistakes. Well, if you look at the tech sector, there is tremendous vibrancy and optimism and everybody believes they are going to change the world. They are not all right but some of them will not be wrong. If you look at things like Google, Amazon or so many of the tech companies, or Microsoft, which did not exist 30 years ago and which was not dominant 20 years ago. There are now major players in the world, so nobody knows what the major participants are going to be 20 years from now, and it is going to generate new opportunities but it is also going to generate new problems. When social media came along, everybody said this is marvellous, this is a way to democratise debate, and everybody has a voice and now we shall have an egalitarian participative, basically Nirvana will have arrived. Now we see what it is like. It does not look like it is Nirvana.  I do not know whether it is democracy surviving but how will human societies adapt to this? Human societies, I mean over many, many centuries have developed to have circuit breakers. A view, an idea develops, it catches fire, a few more people pick it up, it gets tested. Other people may or may not pick it up. Things take time. Gradually, evidence accumulates and then some fail, some succeed, and you move forward. Now, all that is short circuited into one fraction of a second, that length of time it takes to press a button for either Facebook posts or Twitter tweet. When you speed up the operating cycle like that by 100 or 1000 or 10,000 times, the operating system will malfunction. Human beings are not meant to work like that.

Garuda gets new CEO after Harley smuggling fiasco,Jan 22 2020,"JAKARTA () - Garuda Indonesia picked former telecom executive Irfan Setiaputra as its new president director after the airline's previous chief executive was fired for   on a flight to Jakarta. At an extraordinary general meeting on Wednesday (Jan 22), shareholders of Indonesia's flag carrier also decided to keep interim CEO Fuad Rizal as finance director and chose Mr Triawan Munaf, a former head of the country's Creative Economy Agency, as chairman. Mr Setiaputra, 55, joins from Sigfox Indonesia and was previously CEO of state-owned PT Industri Telekomunikasi Indonesia. Challenges for the new CEO, who has not worked in the airline industry before, include restoring Garuda's reputation and bringing down high leasing costs: The carrier spends more on aircraft rentals as a percentage of revenue than any of its global peers. ""The appointment of the new CEO for Garuda Indonesia could help remove one of the key uncertainties in the company,"" said Ms Jessica Pratiwi, an analyst at RHB Securities Indonesia. ""Investors and the public are expecting the new leadership to improve corporate governance."" Mr Setiaputra is Garuda's fourth CEO since Emirsyah Satar - who served the company for nearly a decade - stepped down in 2014. Satar was credited with turning the airline around and restoring its credibility, though he was later arrested for corruption. Garuda went on to report net losses in three of five years through 2018, with about a quarter of revenue being spent on aircraft rental, the highest ratio among any airlines in the world according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The new management will need a sharper focus on fleet utilization, according to Mr Gerry Soejatman, an aviation analyst and technical adviser at NeoSky Aviasi Digital. Garuda said it would cancel orders of 49 Boeing 737 Max aircraft, which have been grounded globally since March following two deadly crashes, including a PT Mentari Lion Airlines flight that plunged into the Java Sea in 2018. Garuda has not decided how to replace the order, which it booked to succeed its older 737-800 models. Boeing 737 planes account for more than a third of Garuda's fleet and have reached an average age of 8.1 years, according to data from website planespotters.net. Among other planes, the carrier also operates six Airbus A330-300 received in 1996 and 1997.","{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.921, 'pos': 0.052, 'compound': 0.7783}",0.7783

Pontian MP Ahmad Maslan was slapped with two charges, namely failure to declare RM2 million (S$663,000), which he allegedly received from Najib, when filing for taxes for the year 2013 and for making false statements to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC). He had claimed to MACC officials that he did not receive the sum from Najib. His party colleague, Johor Baru Umno division chief Shahrir Samad, was accused of not declaring RM1 million he allegedly received from Najib to the Inland Revenue Board in 2013. Both leaders were charged in different courtrooms at the Kuala Lumpur High Court at around the same time. They pleaded not guilty when the charges were read out to them under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001. The duo could be fined up to RM5 million or face a jail term not exceeding five years or both, if convicted. Judge Azman Ahmad set bail at RM500,000 with one guarantor, and ruled that Ahmad's passport be surrendered. Another judge Azura Alwi set Shahrir's bail at RM350,000 with one surety and also ruled that the former Federal Land Development Authority chairman's passport be surrendered. The next case mention for Ahmad is on Feb 21, while Shahrir's will take place on Feb 24. They were separately arrested by the MACC on Monday morning at the graft-buster's headquarters in Putrajaya and later released on bail. MACC revealed in October last year that 80 entities, including individuals, were given two weeks to pay a total of RM420 million, an amount which was classified as fines for receiving monies from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). The commission named Ahmad and Shahrir as among nine individuals who were slapped with the compounds. On Jan 6, the MACC said it would challenge a move that was filed against it on the right to issue compounds to recover funds which allegedly originated from 1MDB. It had been reported that Ahmad and Shahrir were among those challenging the notices issued by MACC.  ","{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.921, 'pos': 0.03, 'compound': -0.7627}",-0.7627

The Iranian-backed Hezbollah and allies including President Michel Aoun nominated Diab as premier last month after efforts failed to strike a deal with Hariri, Lebanon's main Sunni leader and an ally of the West and Gulf Arab states. Weeks of wrangling over portfolios among Hezbollah's allies held up an agreement until Tuesday when the heavily armed group delivered an ultimatum to its allies to make a deal or suffer the consequences, sources familiar with the talks said. The Cabinet is made up of 20 specialist ministers backed by parties. Economist Ghazi Wazni was nominated finance minister with the backing of Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.

"'Green swan' event could trigger global crisis, BIS warns",Jan 21 2020,"BASEL () - Climate change threatens to provoke ""green swan"" events that could trigger a systemic financial crisis unless authorities act against such risks, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The analysis by officials at the Basel-based institution - often described as the central bank for central banks - adapts the ""black swan"" concept devised by Nassim Nicholas Taleb to describe adverse events outside the scope of regular expectations with wide-ranging or extreme impacts. ""Green swans or 'climate black swans' present many features of typical black swans,"" said the authors, who include BIS deputy general manager Luiz Pereira da Silva. ""Traditional approaches to risk management consisting in extrapolating historical data and on assumptions of normal distributions are largely irrelevant to assess future climate-related risks."" Green swans are different from black swans because there is some certainty that climate change risks will one day materialise, which could endanger humanity more than financial crises, and they threaten even more complex and unpredictable chain reactions, the authors wrote. The paper, published just after  , adds to a growing body of central bank-related analysis calling for authorities to better prepare for finance-related risks stemming from climate change. Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau, in an introduction to the paper, argued that ""in order to navigate these troubled waters, more holistic perspectives become essential."" The analysis reiterates often-made arguments that central banks alone can't provide the needed solutions, but also acknowledges that climate change may lead such institutions into uncharted waters where traditional models will tell them little about the scope of the crisis at hand and careful decisions must be taken on how to engage. ""If they sit still and wait for other government agencies to jump into action, they could be exposed to the real risk of not being able to deliver on their mandates,"" the authors argued. Many central banks already contribute to the effort by monitoring climate-related risks through stress tests, incorporating environmental, social and governance criteria in pension funds, or working with banks on disclosing carbon-intensive exposure to assess potential financial-stability risks. Mr Villeroy says that's simply not enough however. ""The stark reality is that we are all losing the fight against climate change,"" Mr Villeroy said, advocating two solutions the European Central Bank could discuss in its upcoming strategy review: integrating climate change in all economic and forecasting models, and overhauling the collateral framework to reflect climate-related risks.","{'neg': 0.124, 'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.04, 'compound': -0.9849}",-0.9849
"Hong Kong stocks tumble on rating downgrade, virus concern",Jan 21 2020,"HONG KONG () - Hong Kong stocks led a broad sell-off in Asia after Moody's Investors Service downgraded the city's rating, stoking concern over its economic recovery, and as worry continues to build about the deadly virus spreading in China and beyond The MSCI Hong Kong Index, which comprises companies that generate much of their revenue in the city, slumped 2.2 per cent. Many property firms were among the biggest decliners, along with casino operators in nearby Macau.  In the wake of the downgrade, “investors would want to cash out before the holiday because there is so much bad news,“ said Jackson Wong, asset management director at Amber Hill Capital Ltd. “It is uncertain how the virus outbreak will develop in China during the holidays. We are holding more cash and we are avoiding travel-related stocks and some technology stocks that had already jumped a lot earlier.” Moody's Investors Service on Monday lowered Hong Kong's rating as a long-term issuer of debt by one notch, just months after   amid political protests. Moody's cited a degree of ""inertia"" characterizing the legislative and executive branches of government in the statement on Monday (Jan 20), as it lowered the rating to Aa3 from Aa2. But the ratings agency also changed the outlook to ""stable"" from ""negative.""

The economy contracted sharply in the third quarter, pushing the city into a recession, as the often-violent clashes led to a plunge in the number of tourists, hurt consumption, and disrupted business operations. The Hong Kong government strongly disagreed with Moody's assessment and was ""deeply disappointed"" by the decision to downgrade. ""Moody's rating falls way out of line with Hong Kong's sound credit fundamentals,"" a government spokesman said in a statement early on Tuesday. ""Our fiscal performance and external positions have long been amongst those of the top-rated economies and serve as a strong buffer for Hong Kong to withstand shocks."" Banks in Hong Kong are ""well-cushioned given their strong capital base, sound liquidity and healthy asset quality"", while initial public offerings and bond financing activities continue despite the unrest, the spokesman added. The move by Moody's marked the first downgrade by the agency of the city's rating since May 2017. Fitch Ratings downgraded it in September to AA from AA+ with a negative outlook. A government report showed Monday that Hong Kong's unemployment rate rose to 3.3 per cent in the three months ending December, compared with just 2.8 per cent in the months before the protests kicked off in June. The local economy is stuck in a ""vicious cycle"" whereby scenes of protest deter tourist arrivals and lower earnings and employment in the retail and hospitality sector, creating further wage cuts and job losses, said Iris Pang, a greater China economist at ING Bank. Because of Hong Kong's low debt-to-GDP ratio, the downgrade was likely more significant for corporate borrowers, she added.","{'neg': 0.1, 'neu': 0.84, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': -0.9705}",-0.9705

PM Shinzo Abe resumes bid to change Japan's Constitution,Jan 21 2020,"TOKYO • Prime Minister Shinzo Abe faces almost insurmountable obstacles to completing his . But that will not stop him from trying. The Premier opened a new session of Parliament yesterday with a fresh call to revise the country's US-imposed post-war Constitution. Mr Abe has raised the issue at almost every public speaking opportunity since the new year, saying he wants to make full use of what he expects will be his final 20 months in office. ""The Constitution shows what form the country will take,"" Mr Abe said. ""It's our responsibility as lawmakers to put forward a proposal for what kind of country we should aim to be in the future,"" he added in comments that drew hearty applause from lawmakers of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Success would help burnish Mr Abe's legacy after he became the country's longest-serving prime minister in November.   was one of the founding principles of the LDP, which argues the move is needed to give Japan's ""self-defence"" forces greater legitimacy and secure Tokyo's interests around the globe. While many in the right-leaning LDP view the Constitution imposed in 1947 as a symbol of Japan's humiliation after World War II, the document has broad political support. Previous talk of amendments, or changing laws to allow Japanese troops to fight abroad, has led to street protests - something Mr Abe may want to avoid as Tokyo prepares to host the Summer Olympics later this year. Mr Abe's challenge was not made any easier by his  , something that would have helped him push through any change. He must also overcome a pushback from within his ruling coalition. Keep up with the latest in the region with the ST Asian Insider newsletter, delivered to your inbox every weekday By signing up, you agree to our   and  ""In terms of political priorities, I don't think public interest is necessarily strong,"" Mr Natsuo Yamaguchi, who leads Mr Abe's Buddhist-backed coalition party, Komeito, told NHK on Jan 12. ""We have to look at this calmly and realistically as we move ahead."" Although a change would please Japan's sole military ally, the United States, which has been prodding Tokyo to take a more assertive security role, it could complicate Mr Abe's other diplomatic efforts. The government is preparing for a state visit this spring by President Xi Jinping of China, where suspicion of Japan's military ambitions still runs deep. South Korea, which has been feuding with Japan over a host of war-related grievances in recent months, has urged its neighbour to ""remain within the mould of the pacifist Constitution"". Taking a conciliatory tone towards Seoul in his policy speech yesterday, Mr Abe said South Korea was Japan's ""most important neighbour"" and that the two shared basic values. The comment comes after South Korean President Moon Jae-in last week proposed that the two countries work together to resolve the issue of wartime forced labourers, and called Japan ""our closest neighbour"". It also follows some fence-mending steps in recent months, including Seoul's reversal of its decision to scrap an intelligence-sharing pact with Japan, and Tokyo's partial easing of curbs on the export of high-tech materials to South Korea. Mr Abe has already outlined his proposed changes - including adding wording to the war-renouncing Article 9 that would make explicit the constitutionality of Japan's Self-Defence Forces. The country maintains almost 250,000 troops, hundreds of fighter jets and dozens of warships, although their activities are constrained by law. Japan spends about 5 trillion yen (S$61 billion) annually on defence. It has ramped up its financing each year that Mr Abe has been in office, in an effort to counter the growing capabilities of nuclear-armed neighbours such as China, Russia and North Korea, which has fired missiles over Japan. Even if Mr Abe were to cobble together the two-thirds majority needed in both Houses of Parliament to pass a change, he would still need to win a national referendum. Some surveys have shown a growing voter willingness to debate the issue, but there is no clear public consensus for a revision.","{'neg': 0.047, 'neu': 0.873, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': 0.9131}",0.9131
"At 50, WEF seeks to move beyond corporate 'speed dating'",Jan 21 2020,"PARIS • Like others approaching middle age, the World Economic Forum (WEF) turns 50 insisting it has matured, that it has moved on from hard partying and wants more meaningful relationships. The focus for this week's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, will be as much on hearing from climate change activists as on rapid-fire corporate deal-making in a succession of cocktail-fuelled soirees, organisers insisted. Guests include Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg and Mr Micah White, co-creator of the anti-finance movement Occupy Wall Street, alongside the more traditional parade of chief executives, celebrities and politicians such as US President Donald Trump. Mr White conceded that ""attending Davos will most likely be reputational suicide"". Nonetheless, he argued for a ""difficult alliance"" between activists and members of the economic and social elite. That much is required if the WEF wants to live up to its slogan of ""improving the state of the world"", a lofty progression since it began in 1971 as a cosy Alpine get-together for European businessmen under the guidance of German economist Klaus Schwab. From a symposium first devoted to bringing US-style best practices to Europe, it has evolved into ""some sort of speed dating"" for economic and political leaders, former European commissioner Pierre Mosco-vici told Agence France-Presse. Mr Schwab's attempts to broaden the agenda to include issues such as climate change and income inequality are a sincere attempt to enhance the dialogue, he said. Privately, company CEOs are gushing in their praise of Davos as an unparalleled opportunity to hobnob with their peers and forge contracts. Critics say that many of those CEOs will undercut the WEF's commitments on the environment by jetting to Switzerland on board private jets. The forum stresses its actions to counter that, such as carbon offsets. Whatever the gap between rhetoric and reality, some appreciate the potential to do good. In 2005, actress Sharon Stone strong-armed the audience of a headline conference and came up with pledges worth more than US$1 million (S$1.35 million) to buy mosquito nets for children in Africa. Greta will be hoping for the same kind of impact when she speaks to the well-heeled crowd to urge them to abandon investments in fossil fuels. Mr Mohamed El-Erian, former head of the giant investment fund Pimco, has called for a rethink of the forum so that participants go not only ""to see and be seen"" but also for a deeper discussion. Such appeals have mounted as globalisation has accelerated, forcing organisations like the WEF to look beyond their founding goals. In the years since 1971, the earth's population has more than doubled to 7.7 billion people. Average global temperatures have risen by 1 deg C, China's share of global economic output has leapt more than five-fold and the Cold War has given way to a fragile new order. From 1971, for many years, ""Davos Man"" ruled the roost, most often the head of a sizeable company. He was typically white. Today, a measure of diversity has crept in as the WEF looks to enhance representation by women and developing countries. Still, many remain unimpressed with what the WEF represents in its 50th year. ""If I went to Davos, it would be to stand behind police barriers"" to protest, not as a participant in the ""big circus"", said Mr Maxime Combes of the French activist group Attac. Warm words on any given topic in Davos do ""not lead at all to changed behaviour"", he said.","{'neg': 0.034, 'neu': 0.906, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': 0.8337}",0.8337
Tech revolution could worsen global inequality: WEF report,Jan 21 2020,"ZURICH • Global inequality is going to worsen unless governments do more to ensure that those most affected by rapid technological change are not just cast aside and forgotten, according to the  . As it prepares for its annual Davos, Switzerland, gathering of leaders this week from the worlds of business, politics and finance, the WEF said it is time to change the fact that a person's lot in life is still largely determined by his socio-economic status at birth. The result, it said, is that societies ""too often reproduce rather than reduce historic inequalities"". The WEF yesterday released the findings of its social mobility report. The Global Social Mobility Index benchmarks 82 economies, assessing their levels of mobility in 10 fields including health, education, technology and wages. The report said Europe scores well, particularly Nordic countries, with Denmark coming in first, followed by Norway, Finland, Sweden and Iceland. Calling these five countries ""the closest economies to the ideal state"", the report said they combine provision of access, quality and equity in education with provision of work opportunities and good working conditions, social protection and inclusive institutions. Japan is ranked 15th, the highest among Asian countries. Singapore is in 20th spot, the highest among South-east Asian countries. It ranks within the top 10 globally on education access, as well as education quality and equity. South Korea is ranked 25th and China 45th. The United States came in at 27th spot. The report noted that there are only a handful of countries with the right conditions to foster social mobility. Most countries underperform in four areas: fair wages, social protection, working conditions and lifelong learning. ""In most countries, individuals from certain groups have become historically disadvantaged and poor social mobility perpetuates and exacerbates such inequalities. In turn, these types of inequalities can undermine the cohesiveness of economies and societies,"" said the report. The long-running issues have fed a growing sense of unfairness - even where economic measures suggest inequality is broadly narrowing - and an erosion of trust and disenchantment with politics. ""The Fourth Industrial Revolution, and with it, continuing and future disruption to labour markets, will likely compound differences in social mobility for those countries unprepared to take advantage of new opportunities,"" the report said. It said that giving everyone the chance to fulfil their potential would not only improve personal well-being, but also bring broader benefits by boosting economic growth. ""Inequality has become entrenched and is likely to worsen amidst an era of technological change and efforts towards a green transition,"" it said. Reversing the outlook is possible but requires concerted action, political will and time. Governments must play the role of equaliser, levelling the playing field for all citizens regardless of their socio-economic background, the report added. The WEF offered a number of recommendations for governments and businesses. These include altering personal taxation and addressing wealth concentration, improving education to better equip people throughout their working lives, and more social protection for those whose industries are facing upheaval. Businesses can also promote a culture of meritocracy in hiring, providing vocational education, reskilling and upskilling as well as by paying fair wages.","{'neg': 0.033, 'neu': 0.849, 'pos': 0.118, 'compound': 0.9903}",0.9903
Helping South Korean firms go global - via Singapore,Jan 21 2020,"Keen to encourage responsible pet ownership and reduce the problem of pets being abandoned, student Choi Hyun-il started a website for pet owners to register their furry pals and be connected to an online marketplace. His start-up business, Peopet, has drawn more than 22,000 users since August 2018, and he is building a database of information about pets - such as their common illnesses - and organising events like seminars. ""Peopet went viral on social media because of the identity cards we issue to pets, which make owners feel very proud,"" Mr Choi, 28, told The Straits Times. ""Our goal is to be a one-stop solution for pets, and we hope to go global in 2020."" Expanding overseas will be smoother for Peopet and other budding technology firms when the first-ever Korea Start-up Centre (KSC) opens in Singapore in May, allowing South Korean firms to plug into the city state's vibrant start-up ecosystem. Though a small country of 5.7 million people, Singapore has a start-up ecosystem that dominates venture capital deals in Asean, capturing 49.9 per cent in the first 11 months of last year. This translates to 239 deals worth US$3.7 billion (S$5 billion), according to research portal Preqin. Singapore is home to about 3,800 technology start-ups including ride-hailing platform Grab, more than 100 incubators and accelerators, and 150 venture capital investors. Studies show that more than half of Singapore start-ups have gone global. Slated to offer workspace, networking events and services to start and grow a business, KSC will be run by South Korea's Ministry of SMEs and Start-ups (MSS) with support from Enterprise Singapore. Keep up with the latest in the region with the ST Asian Insider newsletter, delivered to your inbox every weekday By signing up, you agree to our   and  Mr Roh Yong-seok, MSS deputy general for global market policy, said South Korea's government is trying to encourage more start-ups, especially those in artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain and other key technologies, to venture overseas. The KSC will help them settle into Singapore first before ""scaling up globally to enter a third market together"", he added. ""Singapore is not just a window to South-east Asia, but also Europe and America."" Technologically advanced South Korea is a prominent start-up hub in North-east Asia, with more than 440,000 tech start-ups alone. The government has invested heavily in them, setting aside an annual budget of US$1 billion for funding, and a separate US$26 million a year to help firms go global. Five to six thousand start-ups receive government funding every year, said Mr Roh. But only about 500 have ventured overseas. There are also accelerators like D.Camp, a non-profit organisation backed by South Korean banks, which organise contests and festivals to boost the start-up ecosystem. TAPPING EXPERTISE EMATIC CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SIMON WONG Peopet's Mr Choi snagged 10 million won (S$11,600) worth of funding during D.Day, an event in Busan organised by D.Camp last November. While this adds to the 300 million won that he had already secured, he said he will need more funding to expand further. Experts said South Korea - home to 50 million - has a strong manufacturing base and a big pool of talent, but it lacks access to global investors like those in Singapore's financial hub. Strict laws also stand in the way of disruptive business models in South Korea, whereas Singapore is business-friendly and receptive to new ideas. Mr Lee Jae-hyun, team lead of California-based firm Northern Light Venture Capital, said Singapore offers good infrastructure, a strong legal system, the convenience of doing business and ample government support. ""It makes sense for Korean start-ups to set up base in Singapore and then tap (neighbouring) Indonesia and Malaysia,"" he told ST. ""There's cultural proximity and people (in Asean countries) are friendly and warm up to Koreans."" Mr Kim Hong-il, head of D.Camp, who has worked in Singapore, said South Korean start-ups have a lot of good ideas but are restricted by language, limited funding and a closed economy. ""It would be good to link Korea's manufacturing base with Singapore's financial support. Singapore may be a small country but its support for entrepreneurship is better than Korea's,"" he said. While there are over 2,100 South Korean companies with a presence in Singapore, South Korean start-ups have not been as active. This could be due to limited awareness about the opportunities in Singapore, said Enterprise Singapore's global markets director for North-east Asia and Oceania, Mr Johnny Teo. ""There is good potential for more South Korean start-ups to do more in Singapore to expand their presence in the region,"" he told ST. ""The KSC plugs the gap as it will provide the infrastructure and networks for South Korean SMEs and start-ups to set up in Singapore."" MSS will work with its Singapore counterparts to select South Korean start-ups suited to set up at the KSC, most likely those specialising in AI, financial technology, clean technology and smart mobility. The new start-up centre will also offer opportunities for Singapore SMEs and start-ups to break into the South Korean market. ""South Korea is known for its strong pool of tech start-ups that specialise in shared economy, Internet of Things, as well as deep tech (for example, fintech, medtech and foodtech) - which are synergistic with Singapore,"" said Mr Teo. ""Our companies can therefore explore co-development and commercialisation opportunities, not just for South Korea but also for other markets, including the broader North-east Asia."" Foodtech start-up Zeemart, for one, is keen to introduce its digital procurement platform to South Korean food giants such as bakery chain Paris Baguette. Zeemart chief product officer Keith Tan told ST that the firm's solution can help small food business owners save the hassle of managing finances and allow them to focus on food quality. Tourism start-up Fooyo is keen to offer its AI-powered solutions to cities such as Seoul and Busan to enhance the travel experience, while Ematic Solutions is confident that its AI-enabled solutions can help South Korean companies optimise their online marketing efforts. All three firms participated in the Asean-Republic of Korea Start-up Expo held in Busan last November, on the sidelines of the Asean-Republic of Korea Commemorative Summit.","{'neg': 0.019, 'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.164, 'compound': 0.9994}",0.9994
"Sharing data in itself not panacea to policy issues, says Chan Chun Sing",Jan 21 2020,"Sharing data is not the panacea to all policy issues, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said at an Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) conference yesterday.Tee Zhuo Having the people's trust and ensuring objective interpretations of the data are also important, he said in response to a call from People's Power Party chief Goh Meng Seng for the Government to provide more data for fruitful policy debates. ""If we go in with preconceived ideas on what the data should tell us and we have a confirmation bias, we will go and interpret it in a (certain) way,"" said Mr Chan. The issue of public access to data has been in the spotlight after Mr Chan sparred with Workers' Party chief Pritam Singh in Parliament earlier this month over how new jobs are distributed among Singaporeans and permanent residents (PRs). Referring to this issue yesterday, Mr Chan said the data shows slightly better employment figures for PRs, which some might say support the interpretation that the Government ""doesn't care about the citizens"". ""The other interpretation is, actually we have pre-selected the PRs. If the PRs are unemployed, it will be very difficult for them to get PR (status) unless they have strong family ties here,"" he said. He also cited a ""recent example"", where data was available but a graph was truncated. He was referring to a correction direction issued under the fake news law by the Manpower Ministry, which said a graphic on Singapore's population policy used by the Singapore Democratic Party online was misleading. While having more data helps, it also has to be framed objectively, he said, adding: ""If people don't trust you, you can give as much data as you want, and you will not win over the hearts or the minds of the people."" The minister also listed three wishes he has for Singapore's political system in a wide-ranging dialogue at the IPS' Singapore Perspectives conference. His first wish was to have more in-depth discussions with Singaporeans on challenges and policy issues, he said. Recalling productive closed-door sessions with his own staff and other Singaporeans, he said the question was how to scale up such sessions, which may involve issues that cannot be as freely discussed with non-Singaporeans. He clarified in response to a question from an audience member that these issues included defence and security, foreign affairs and geopolitics, and Singapore's economic strategy. ""There are many things that we discuss in public and that I think would benefit a lot from having (opinions of) foreigners,"" he said, adding that Singapore's foreign friends provide counsel and help check for ""blind spots"". His second wish was for Singaporeans to become less inward-looking and be more cognisant of the external environment. Citing the $15.2 billion in investments secured by the Economic Development Board announced last week, he said that there were some who questioned the investments and whether they were too much. ""What lies underneath this set of questions is perhaps a lack of appreciation of the external environment we are operating in. It is not as if we have a choice to pick one investment and not another investment,"" he said, adding that Singapore loses some investments to competitors. Third, Mr Chan said he hopes Singapore will continue to maintain the ethos of making decisions not just for the current generation, but for future generations as well. Few societies can leave behind something for the next generation or finance infrastructure without borrowing or taxing heavily, he noted, adding that issues like climate change, fiscal reserves and even jobs cut across generations.","{'neg': 0.059, 'neu': 0.828, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': 0.9855}",0.9855
4G leaders to offer Singaporeans more say in shaping policy: Heng Swee Keat,Jan 21 2020,"Amid challenges such as inequality and economic disruption, the fourth-generation leadership is determined to build a future of progress and prosperity for Singaporeans, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said yesterday.Lim Yan Liang Mr Heng, who is expected to take over as Singapore's next leader in the coming years, also painted a vision of how he and his colleagues intend to lead the country. Their approach hinges on going beyond working for Singaporeans to working with them in designing policies and implementing them. He also hinted that plans are afoot to give more help to lower-income Singaporeans. ""We are now studying how we can better help lower-and lower-middle-income Singaporeans, including current and future seniors, to meet their retirement needs in a sustainable way,"" said Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister. More help will also be given to workers - like those in their 40s and 50s - to upskill, with the Government putting in place the next phase of SkillsFuture, he added. ""I will provide more details in the coming Budget."" Speaking at the Institute of Policy Studies' annual Singapore Perspectives conference, Mr Heng invited ""all Singaporeans to work with us, and with each other"" to tackle the challenges facing the nation. Receive e-mail newsletter on key announcements and how they affect you. By signing up, you agree to our   and  Just as the founding leaders fostered a sense of nationhood through policies such as home ownership that gave the people a stake in Singapore, Mr Heng said the Singapore Together movement launched last year ""will be our new cornerstone of nation building"". For instance, new platforms have already engaged Singaporeans on ways to improve work-life harmony and encourage household recycling, said Mr Heng. Singaporeans are also being involved in the development of Singapore's landscape such as the Somerset Belt, the Geylang Serai cultural precinct as well as parks. ""What we see forming is a new model of partnership between the Government and Singaporeans in owning, shaping and acting on our future,"" he told an audience of students, academics and policymakers. ""In this process, government agencies are learning to develop and deliver policy solutions in a more collaborative manner."" This collaborative approach is Singapore's way forward in a world marked by differences and uncertainty, he said. He noted that many countries have seen their political consensus fracture over the past decade, brought about by changes such as technological disruption, growing inequality and ageing populations. Singapore is not immune to these divisive forces, and there were hints of this in some of the public discourse around foreigners, he added. Amid these disruptive forces, a strong sense of unity is key to keeping Singapore successful, the same way the founding political leaders beat the long odds facing the Republic in the early days, said Mr Heng. ""Our improbable success was made possible by exceptional governance - capable leaders, working together with a united people."" People had a stake in the country and there was trust between them and the Government. ""This approach must remain core to the Government's mission, especially as we grapple with longer-term issues facing us,"" he said. But in a society increasingly flooded by information and misinformation, it is critical to find ways to deepen understanding and relationships among people, he noted. ""We must reject extremist views that will fray our social fabric, and be discerning about falsehoods and irresponsible promises that cannot be fulfilled."" That is why giving Singaporeans a bigger role in shaping policy would help them appreciate the trade-offs involved and distinguish truth from falsehoods, he said. Singaporeans have also shown they want to let their actions speak for themselves: Total volunteer hours have nearly trebled in the past 10 years, from 45 million hours in 2008 to 122 million hours in 2018, he noted. At the same time, the Government will continue to exercise leadership in areas such as security and defence, and in planning for the long term, said Mr Heng.","{'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.851, 'pos': 0.118, 'compound': 0.9946}",0.9946

Finance wants competitiveness role for UK watchdogs after Brexit,Jan 23 2020,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s regulators should have a formal role after Brexit to keep the financial sector globally competitive and less prone to  “gold-plating” international norms, an industry think tank said on Thursday. The International Regulatory Strategy Group (IRSG) said new thinking and targeted reforms were required after Britain leaves the European Union on Jan. 31. UK regulators will write its own financial rules instead of applying those fashioned by Brussels. “Brexit does change the structure around regulation and we need to reflect that,” Mark Hoban, chair of the IRSG and a former UK financial services minister, told Reuters. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England are responsible for keeping markets and financial firms safe and stable. But in a report on regulation after Brexit, the IRSG called for a secondary remit of ensuring that rules do not put the financial sector at a competitive disadvantage to New York, Frankfurt or other rival centers. British regulators have resisted such calls, fearing it would increase pressure to ease rules. Their predecessors had to “have regard” to Britain’s global financial role and were tarnished by a “light-touch” reputation after the financial crisis a decade ago. “The use of the word competitiveness is often quite loaded,” said Julian Adams, regulatory and government relations director at insurer M&G, and chair of the IRSG report. “This is not code for a race to the bottom,” said Adams, also a former senior insurance regulator at the Bank of England.  The IRSG is sponsored by the City of London financial district and TheCityUK, which promotes Britain as a financial center. Britain will remain a member of international financial standard setters after Brexit, whose norms typically form the basis for national or EU laws that Britain has often “gold-plated” - or toughened up. The report calls for Britain to formally take into account international norms when writing rules to avoid exceeding them unnecessarily in a way that would harm UK competitiveness. “You make sure the global standard is as good as you want it to be and need it to be as a regulator, and then you would try and limit to the extent possible any gold-plating,” Adams said. UK rulemaking in isolation could also have implications for access to EU investors after Brexit, said Lucy Fergusson, lead author of the IRSG report and a lawyer at Linklaters. The report called for a new parliamentary committee to directly focus on financial rules. The competitiveness call is likely to get a sympathetic hearing from government, mindful that finance is Britain’s biggest tax-raising sector which may not secure good future access to the EU, its biggest export customer.

"After China trade deal, Europe and UK next on Trump's to-do list",Jan 23 2020,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to rip up international trade deals and rebalance America’s global trade relationships. Three years into his presidency, he has done just that, using a slew of tariffs, threats, and bilateral talks to shake up relations with nearly every major U.S. trading partner.  Graphic: United States top trade partners  With a Phase 1 trade deal in hand with China, and a revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) complete at home, Trump is now turning his attention to Europe, post-Brexit Britain, and India.  Here’s what’s likely to happen next:  Washington and the European Union remain at odds over aircraft subsidies, trade barriers, and plans by European countries to impose taxes on digital services. Trump this week renewed threats to impose “Section 232” tariffs of up to 25% on auto imports from the EU, even though he missed a November deadline set by U.S. law to decide on the tariffs.   The EU will respond to any additional tariffs with duties of its own, Germany’s ambassador to the United States, Emily Haber, said on Wednesday. France on Monday agreed to suspend a 3% digital tax on U.S. tech companies in exchange for Washington holding off on a threat to impose tariffs of up to 100% on a $2.4 billion list of French imports, a French diplomatic source said. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Italy and Britain will also face tariffs if they impose digital taxes.  Washington has already imposed a 25% tariff on European wines and other goods, and a 10% tariff on aircraft, and threatened to raise those tariffs and expand the list of affected products if the subsidy issue is not resolved. Trump has been promising a “massive” new trade deal with the U.K., the United States’ seventh-largest trading partner, since British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s election win in December, but a rift opened between the two countries this week.  After Mnuchin and Trump both threatened to put tariffs on imports from Britain if it proceeds with a planned digital tax, Britain’s finance minister Sajid Javid said it would go ahead with the tax in April anyway. Javid also said at Davos that a new trade deal with the EU was Britain’s “first priority” ahead of a deal with the United States.   Trump is expected to sign into law in coming weeks  legislation that will implement the new United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement. Mexico has already ratified the deal, which replaces the 26-year-old NAFTA, and Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pushing for the Canadian Parliament to ratify it as quickly as possible. His Conservative opposition wants more time to study the agreement.  The United States eliminated India’s special trade status under the Generalized System of Preferences in June, affecting some $5.6 billion worth of Indian exports to the United States, amid a dispute over India’s new digital trade restrictions.  Both governments had hoped to hammer out a limited trade deal in September, but negotiations fell apart over tariffs on U.S. farm products and approval schedules for Indian pharmaceuticals.  Discussions have heated up again ahead of Trump’s expected visit to India in February. Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in September signed a limited trade deal that cuts tariffs on U.S. farm goods, Japanese machine tools and other products, deferring a threat of higher U.S. car duties. The two countries are due to tackle the automotive issue in a second round of negotiations expected to start in April.  The United States and China are expected to start talks on thorny issues such as Chinese subsidies as part of a Phase 2 trade deal, after Washington agreed in December to roll back some tariffs in exchange for China’s pledge to buy $200 billion more in U.S. goods and services over the next two years. Trade experts are skeptical that any agreement will occur before the U.S. presidential election in November. ","{'neg': 0.067, 'neu': 0.834, 'pos': 0.099, 'compound': 0.9812}",0.9812
"Aramco IPO proceeds to fund Saudi industry, including defense: finance minister",Jan 21 2020,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will pump the proceeds from last month’s listing of oil giant Saudi Aramco into the local economy over several years, including building up the domestic defense industry amid tensions with Iran, its finance minister said on Tuesday. Mohammed al-Jadaan told Reuters there were “serious efforts” to reduce antagonism between Washington and Tehran after a top Iranian general was killed in a U.S. air strike and Iran retaliated with missile attacks against American bases in Iraq. “If you look at history, we in this region have managed to weather through worse geopolitical situations, including actual, real wars,” he said in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. “We in Saudi have to focus on the economy and reform ... We firmly believe the disputes can only be resolved by dialogue.” A string of attacks last year on tankers in Gulf waters and Saudi oil sites, including the world’s largest oil processing facility, pierced Saudi defenses and threatened to derail a reform agenda aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil. Riyadh and Washington blame the strikes on Iran, which denies involvement but has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz shipping channel in retaliation for sanctions placed on its crude exports by Western powers. The United States is sending additional military forces to Saudi Arabia, and France has deployed a radar system to bolster the kingdom’s air defenses. Even before the recent tensions, Riyadh had begun a drive to localize 50% of military spending led by Saudi Arabian Military Industries, owned by the state Public Investment Fund (PIF). With nearly $30 billion coming into PIF coffers from Aramco’s local share offering last month, new and existing local industries, including defense and technology, will get a boost in capital, Jadaan said. “We work with our military industry to develop our own military assets in the mid-term to deal with these risks, including investment by PIF,” he added. The Saudi economy, the largest in the Arab world, remains dominated by hydrocarbon revenues despite plans to diversify. It has suffered in recent years because of low oil prices and austerity measures aimed at reducing a huge budget deficit. Jadaan said he expected to see healthier oil prices in 2020 due to solid demand, reduced output and easing trade tensions. He also predicted a smaller deficit by the end of the year than announced last month, when Riyadh said it could face a deficit of nearly $50 billion this year. Yet the International Monetary Fund on Monday lowered its forecast for Saudi Arabia’s economic growth to 1.9% this year due to output cuts agreed last month with the OPEC+ group of oil producers. Saudi Arabia has said it expects growth of 2.3%. “Our focus is firmly on non-oil GDP growth, with focus on tourism, entertainment, sports, technology and financial sector,” Jadaan said. He said the presidency of the Group of 20 major economies, which Saudi Arabia assumed this year, was an important step towards resolving the region’s problems. “It is critical the world’s attention is brought to the Middle East,” said Jadaan. “If you deal with some of the regional problems, it will be a relief for the world.” ","{'neg': 0.128, 'neu': 0.781, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': -0.9643}",-0.9643

Argentine bonds fall as Buenos Aires province extends creditor deadline,Jan 22 2020,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine sovereign and provincial bonds dipped on Wednesday as the provincial government in Buenos Aires was forced to extend a deadline for creditors to agree or reject a plan to delay a $250 million bond repayment originally due on Jan. 26. The province said on Wednesday, minutes after the consent solicitation deadline had elapsed at 1pm (1600 GMT), that it would extend the cut-off for responses related to a 2021 bond until the same time on Jan. 31. The province needs to receive consent from holders of over 75% of the principal amount of debt. “To date we have received the support of a significant number of bondholders, and we continue in dialogue with institutional investors whose participation would allow us to arrive at the desired result,” Pablo Lopez, the province minister of treasury and finance, said in a statement. The payment on the 2021 bond marks the first major test for the South American country as it grapples with far more complex talks to restructure about $100 billion in public debts that the new Peronist government says it cannot currently pay. Ilya Gofshteyn, a senior emerging markets strategist at Standard Chartered Bank, said that if Buenos Aires could not get sufficient bondholder support, it likely reflected the “difficulties facing the sovereign restructuring discussions.” The provincial government said the terms of the bond gave it a grace period of 10 days for capital payments and 30 days for interest payments without triggering a default. Buenos Aires province, Argentina’s largest by far, said this month it was seeking “temporary financial relief” from holders of the 2021 bond, and requested an extension to May 1 to make the repayment due this month. Without consent, the province - and the national government - will be in something of a bind, analysts said. “The alternatives are to either reach 75% agreement for consent solicitation to postpone the payment to May 1 or otherwise risk a hard default,” Amherst Pierpont said in a note on Wednesday, adding the question would be whether the state would intervene at the last minute. “It’s a game of brinkmanship on whether either side caves in to avoid a hard default next week.” Prices for Argentina’s over-the-counter (OTC) bonds were down on average around 1.3%, while Buenos Aires bonds fell across the board, led by a 3.5 point drop in the 2021 bond. Argentina’s economy minister said on Tuesday the government was sending a debt sustainability bill to lawmakers to help bolster the country’s ability to pay. Argentina’s center-left President Alberto Fernandez has said the country needs to be given time by creditors, including the International Monetary Fund, to revive growth in order to be able to do so.

"Furious at federation, Russian star braces for prospect of second missed Olympics",Jan 23 2020,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - High jumper Maria Lasitskene, a three-time world champion, is getting a feeling of deja vu as she readies for the prospect of missing a second consecutive Olympics because of doping scandals at Russia’s athletics federation. Sidelined from the 2016 Rio Olympics because of the federation’s suspension, Lasitskene says her chances of competing at this year’s Tokyo Games are slim after a fresh scandal emerged last year at the beleaguered body. “There is absolutely no certainty, there is no understanding of what to expect,” the 27-year-old told Reuters at the Salyut Geraklion stadium in northwestern Moscow on Wednesday. “The same thing could happen again.” Russia’s athletics federation was suspended in 2015 after a report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of mass doping in the sport and had since been trudging toward reinstatement. But World Athletics, the global governing body of athletics formerly known as the IAAF, halted Russia’s reinstatement process in November last year. The decision came after the federation’s president and six other people were provisionally suspended for having provided forged documents to justify a whereabouts violation by high jumper Danil Lysenko. “Everyone was scrutinizing us from all sides. How could they allow such a thing to happen?,” Lasitskene sighed. “It’s a complete mess and disrespects all athletes.” As a result of the scandal, World Athletics has for now stopped clearing Russians to compete internationally as neutrals, sidelining Lasitskene from international meets. It has also raised the possibility of expelling the Russian athletics federation altogether.  Lasitskene blames the federation for having deepened the crisis and is ready to sue it or some of its officials if she misses her winter season, including her chance to defend her world indoor title in March in China. “If I miss the winter season, unfortunately no one will compensate me for my losses, starting with huge losses to my image,” Lasitskene said.  “I’ve been trusted for years, given a neutral status. The whole world knew that I was clean. This now affects my image, my moral state and my finances.” Lasitskene said she feared her sponsor Nike would lower its funding if she were to be sidelined from the winter season. She will also miss out on crucial meets to prepare for the unlikely prospect of competing at the Tokyo Games.  “All competitions heading into the Olympics are like a chain,” she said. “Every competition builds up to it, and it’s impossible to compensate for that in Russia.” The worsening crisis comes as Russia appeals a four-year ban from competing under its flag at major international events in all sports, including the Tokyo Olympics, as punishment for having provided WADA with doctored laboratory data.  Lasitskene said she hoped Russian athletes would win the right to compete under their flag, even though she is doubtful there will be any track and field stars from Russia in Tokyo.  “No one has ever apologised for all this time,” she said. “Because of their actions, I have lost a lot and it has affected me.” ","{'neg': 0.143, 'neu': 0.784, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': -0.9894}",-0.9894
Australia's Westpac to appoint McFarlane as chairman - AFR,Jan 22 2020,"Jan 22 (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp is set to appoint former Australia and New Zealand Banking Group chief executive John McFarlane to succeed chairman Lindsay Maxsted, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported  on Wednesday. Maxsted, who served as Westpac’s chairman for eight years, said in November he would retire in the first half of 2020 after the bank was embroiled in a money laundering scandal involving child exploitation. Financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC filed a lawsuit against Westpac in November, accusing the country’s No. 2 lender of enabling 23 million payments in breach of money laundering laws. The scandal saw Chief Executive Brian Hartzer step down after more than seven years with the company, while Maxsted said he would retire in early 2020, sooner than planned. The AFR said Westpac will announce the appointment on Thursday morning. Westpac did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Finance industry veteran McFarlane, 72, was chief executive of ANZ for 10 years until 2007, and stepped down as the chairman of British banking giant Barclays PLC last year.

Bankers ‘bombard’ Guyana with financing plans as oil boom begins: finance minister,Jan 21 2020,"GEORGETOWN (Reuters) - Bankers are “bombarding” Guyana with offers of financing backed by future oil production, the finance minister told Reuters, but the South American nation is rejecting the proposals to avoid the excessive borrowing that has plagued other oil producers. As the former British colony begins its first significant oil production this year, it is wary of avoiding the mistakes made in oil-dependent economies such as Angola, Nigeria and its economically collapsing neighbor Venezuela. Winston Jordan, an economist and career public servant, also cited Guyana’s own history of economic crisis in the 1980s for turning down overtures to finance infrastructure and development before oil money started flowing. “At the IMF meetings, I was bombarded, at the IDB meetings, I’m bombarded with people telling you how much money they can lend you,” he said in an interview on Wednesday in his Georgetown office, referring to the International Monetary Fund and Inter-American Development Bank. He declined to name the specific institutions, saying only that “quite a few banks, quite a few middlemen” offered loans of between $500 million and $2 billion. During the oil boom years, Venezuela borrowed more than $50 billion from China through loans that were repaid in oil shipments, a practice later replicated in Ecuador. The arrangements were criticized for lack of transparency. A consortium led by Exxon Mobil () has discovered more than 6 billion barrels of oil and gas off Guyana, a find that could transform the impoverished country’s agriculture- and mining-dependent economy. With fewer than 800,000 inhabitants, Guyana is seen as a test for whether oil revenue can spur sustainable development in a country lacking strong institutions.  Other petrostates have seen crude sales lead to corruption and debt-fueled spending binges, often described as the “resource curse.” Guyana in the early 1980s defaulted on foreign debt, fueling an economic crisis characterized by chronic shortages of consumer goods. Following economic austerity and debt relief, the economy began recovering in the 1990s. “I much rather that we slowly ramp up,” Jordan said. “We will avoid resource curse.” Legislation this year established that Guyana’s oil revenue will flow to a sovereign wealth fund, and withdrawals must fund specific projects rather than day-to-day expenses. Committees to oversee the fund have not been formed because the opposition and the private sector have not named representatives, Jordan said.  The opposition People’s Progressive Party has said President David Granger’s government overstepped its authority by forming the fund, given its “caretaker” status after losing a 2018 no-confidence vote. The opposition is promising a new sovereign wealth fund “insulated from political interference.” ","{'neg': 0.112, 'neu': 0.826, 'pos': 0.061, 'compound': -0.9779}",-0.9779

Boxing qualifiers set for Wuhan nixed over health fears: media,Jan 22 2020,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Qualifying boxing matches for Asia and Oceania for the 2020 Olympic Games that were set to take place in China’s Wuhan next month have been canceled due to fears over the new flu-like coronavirus, Japan’s Kyodo news agency said on Wednesday. Boxing preparations for the Games have already been upended after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in June took over the competition and suspended the international boxing federation due to issues with its finances and governance. The IOC have instead set up a task force, led by its member and International Gymnastics Federation head Morinari Watanabe, to organize the boxing events. The Kyodo report cited organizers as the source of the news. Reuters was unable to immediately contact Watanabe. The IOC did not immediately return requests for comment. The Tokyo 2020 organizing committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.  The death toll from the virus in China rose to nine on Wednesday with 440 confirmed cases, Chinese health officials said as authorities stepped up efforts to control the outbreak by discouraging public gatherings in Hubei province. The Tokyo organizing committee has previously said in response to questions on health concerns for the 2020 Olympics that, “countermeasures against infectious diseases constitute an important part of our plans to host a safe and secure Games.” It added that it would “continue to collaborate with all relevant organizations which carefully monitor any incidence of infectious diseases and we will review any countermeasures that may be necessary with all relevant organizations.” The global boxing body has been in turmoil over its finances and governance for years with the federation $16 million in debt.

Brazil's growth at mercy of hotly disputed 'expansionary austerity',Jan 21 2020,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s right-wing government has entered 2020 doubling down on one of the principal economic policies that marked its first year in office: the controversial view that aggressively slashing spending will spur and accelerate economic growth. In a paper entitled “Expansionary fiscal consolidation in Brazil” published Dec. 31, it argued cleaning up public finances will fuel private sector confidence and demand, and ultimately a boom in economic activity. According to the paper, which reflects the thinking of Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, the fiscal consolidation underway will have a near instant positive impact.  “This is based on the perception that fiscal policy has non-Keynesian effects in the current context of the Brazilian economy, in contrast with the alternative and in our view mistaken assertion that increased spending is a way of stimulating economic activity,” it said. Government spending fell in the second and third quarters of 2019, the first time in more than two years it has fallen for two straight quarters. It almost certainly fell in the fourth. On an annual comparison basis, government consumption is falling 1.4%, on course to contract at its fastest rate in almost 20 years.  (GRAPHIC: Brazil Govt Consupmption - Y/Y change: ) After trade, it is the only segment of the economy providing a negative contribution to growth. Agriculture, industry, business investment, services and consumer spending are all expanding, albeit at a far from blistering pace.  But the notion that this drag on growth in and of itself somehow boosts private sector investment and spending has been widely criticized - many would say debunked - since the financial crisis of 2007-09. Robert Skidelsky, professor emeritus of political economy at Warwick University in Britain, has derided the notion of a “confidence fairy” as no more believable than the tooth fairy, arguing that “(economic) recovery may come about despite fiscal austerity, but never because of it.” Not everyone thinks it’s make-believe. Carlos Kawall, director at Asa Bank in Sao Paulo, argues that the economy’s current 2-2.5% annualized growth is largely down to the fiscal discipline which allowed the central bank to cut interest rates to a record low 4.5%. “If the government spends more, interest rates will go back up and you will not get the economic benefits we’re currently seeing in terms of consumer credit and spending, business investment, and now growth,” Kawall said.  “This policy is working. It’s harder to grow this way, but it’s more sustainable.” Nominally, the government’s 54.22 billion reais public expenditure bill in the third quarter of 2019 was the lowest in almost seven years. As a share of GDP, Brazilian government spending is also falling, albeit more slowly. It remains high: at around 18-19% of GDP it is above the Latin American and Caribbean average, according to the World Bank, and in 2018 was higher than emerging market peers China, Russia, India and South Korea. Nearly half of its outlay in 2018 went on pensions, one of the highest in the world and the impetus for sweeping social security reform that helped drive the Bovespa stock market’s 32% rally last year, over double the MSCI emerging index. Markets have responded strongly. But the economy hasn’t, and probably won’t, according to Monica De Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. While Brazil needs to get public finances back on a more even keel, De Bolle says there is no empirical or historical evidence that ‘expansionary austerity’ delivers economic growth.  Brazil should target public sector inefficiencies to generate savings and funding for social programs to protect those most vulnerable to the effects of austerity, rather than reducing the size of the state per se. What’s more, such an aggressive squeeze is unnecessary. Unlike Argentina, or Brazil in the late 1990s, the country does not face a balance of payments crisis.  It has $360 billion in foreign currency reserves, foreign direct investment more than covers the current account deficit, and local firms are borrowing more in reais, reducing the private sector’s exposure to foreign currency debt.  “This idea of expansionary austerity should have died with the emerging market experiences of the 1990s. It failed miserably, especially in Asia. It’s a mixture of ideology and bad economics,” De Bolle said. ","{'neg': 0.101, 'neu': 0.83, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': -0.9702}",-0.9702
Breakingviews - Italian banks will yield to M&A imperative,Jan 23 2020,"MILAN (Reuters Breakingviews) - Italian banks are facing a renewed urge to merge. A decade after the euro zone crisis erupted, the country’s lenders have shed most of their bad loans, while doubling their capital ratios. The problem now is that they can’t earn decent returns. Ultra-low interest rates and attempts to limit their holdings of government bonds make the need to join forces with rivals all the more pressing. For years Italy’s bad loans were the main headache for European regulators. Now the pain is easing. A flurry of disposals has allowed Italian banks to halve the overall stock of gross bad credit on their balance sheets to 177 billion euros by June last year, from 360 billion euros at the peak of the crisis in 2015. Many large transactions, including UniCredit’s mammoth 18 billion euro FINO or “Failure is Not an Option” sale and Banco BPM’s 5 billion euro “Exodus”, had dramatic names that stressed bankers’ awareness of the urgency of the situation. After deducting provisions, net bad loans stood at 30 billion euros in November last year, or 1.7% of total loans. Meanwhile, Italian banks have boosted their capital buffers. The average common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.6% of total risk-weighted assets at the end of September, twice the level before the global financial crisis erupted in 2007. The cleanup effort has successfully reduced financial risk, but at a cost. Many Italian banks were forced to take big writedowns when they sold their sour credits, or increase provisions against future losses. The industry has collectively generated an annual return on equity of just 0.8% since 2007, according to Italy’s banking association ABI. Profitability has picked up since: the average ROE at the end of September was 8%, according to the European Central Bank. However, that’s still below the industry’s cost of capital, which senior Italian bankers estimate at more than 10%. That is one reason why listed Italian banks trade on average at half their book value. There’s little prospect of improvement. While grappling with Italy’s stagnating economy, domestic banks also face an extended period of negative official interest rates. Meanwhile, regulators seem inclined to keep raising capital requirements.  And banks have new problems. Italian lenders hold about 400 billion euros of government debt. At 10% of combined assets, this is one of the highest proportions in Europe – and more than twice the level before the financial crisis. That reinforces the “doom loop” which ties troubled banks to their cash-strapped governments. To discourage such high concentration, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz in November suggested stripping state debt of its risk-free status. Other ideas proposed by policymakers and academics include putting a cap on the amount of their own government’s debt that banks can hold. Buying relatively high-yielding Italian sovereign bonds has been a cheap way for banks to boost their interest income. But if capital charges or curbs come into place, that will dry up. Faced with uncertainty over their future earnings, Italian bank executives have all the more reason to consolidate. Italy has 490 different credit institutions, roughly one for every 123,000 inhabitants, twice as many as Spain. The action is likely to focus on domestic combinations, where overlaps can generate greater savings. Mid-sized players like Giuseppe Castagna’s Banco BPM and Victor Massiah’s UBI Banca might start the merger dance. Asset managers like Banca Generali or Azimut could also become targets. Mediobanca, which has some spare cash and is building up its wealth management business, is already on the prowl. Successful mergers face hurdles, though. Regulators are likely to demand that any merged bank completely writes down any lingering dud loans. That may require lenders to raise capital and delay any near-term promise of increased dividends. Also, rigid Italian labour laws may limit banks’ ability to reduce staff. If they delay, however, bank CEOs may have to present investors with the unappealing prospect of gradually eroding profitability. They would also miss the opportunity to take advantage of a scheme the government is offering to fund early retirement. Troubled lender Banca Carige has already used it as part of its wide-ranging restructuring. Meanwhile, the threat of regulators slapping Italian lenders with higher capital charges if they continue to hold too much state debt cannot be dismissed. Despite some recent high-profile tie-ups, such as the creation of Banco BPM, or Intesa Sanpaolo’s purchase of two troubled Veneto-based lenders in 2017,  Italian banks still have plenty of scope to consolidate. With pressure mounting, sitting still is no longer an option.Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Brexit brings jobs boost - for Germany,Jan 23 2020,"BERLIN (Reuters) - About two dozen British firms told German authorities in 2019 they plan to open offices in Germany and will create 680 new jobs, more than in the previous two years combined, the government’s business marketing arm said on Thursday. Germany Trade and Invest (GTAI) linked the increase to Britain’s departure from the European Union on January 31, and said the number of planned new jobs may rise as some firms registered plans directly with Germany’s 16 federal states. “We are witnessing a constant increase in the activity of British companies in Germany,” said GTAI chief Robert Hermann.

About a third were finance and business services companies, just under a third specialized in IT and some 40% were a mix that included engineering and consumer specialists. Britain’s parliament has approved a divorce settlement with the EU, which includes a business-as-usual transition deal covering the period after Brexit Day on Jan. 31 until the end of December. Hermann said British business leaders appear undeterred by Germany’s weakening economy, whose export-oriented manufacturing sector is in recession.

Kem Sokha was arrested in 2017 and his party banned in a crackdown by Hun Sen on opposition, civil society groups and the media in the run-up to the 2018 parliamentary election, in which the ruling party won every seat. Sokha, 66, is on trial on charges of treason, accused of having conspired with the United States to topple Hun Sen. He denies the charges, calling them politically motivated. If convicted, Sokha would face up to 30 years in prison. Some reporters were allowed to view trial proceedings on Wednesday after being barred from sessions last week. In the video, which runs for over an hour and was submitted as evidence by Sokha himself, the defendant said he had received advice and financing from unidentified Americans to support ways of fostering democracy and human rights in Cambodia. “I rented a radio station, America let me rent a radio station...to educate people at the grassroots,” Sokha said in the video, citing a station owned by local former opposition politician Mam Sonando. “I...brought him $50,000 of U.S. money for him to set up the radio, making its signal stronger (so as to) air my speeches every day from public forums,” Sokha said. He denied any intent to seek change through violence in Cambodia, which suffered bloody upheaval in which some two million people died under the brutal Maoist Khmer Rouge regime during the 1970s. “Do we want Khmer blood to flow again? The answer is no, we don’t want (that),” Sokha said in the video. “We, the National Rescue Party, absolutely do not use violence. Anyone who wants to use violence or force..., we do not do it because I regret Khmer blood, I do not want to do (that).” A spokesperson at U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Hun Sen himself is a former Khmer Rouge guerrilla who defected to the regime’s eventual conquerors, Vietnam, and he has been in power since the mid-1980s. Hun Sen has cast his crackdown on opposition as vital to preserve law and order. Sokha’s trial continues on Thursday.  ","{'neg': 0.173, 'neu': 0.73, 'pos': 0.098, 'compound': -0.9925}",-0.9925

Credit Suisse says Mozambique liable for $622 million loan at heart of bribery scandal,Jan 22 2020,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Credit Suisse () has hit back against Mozambique in a case in Britain’s High Court, arguing a government guarantee for a $622 million loan - part of a $2 billion debt scandal - is valid and that it is entitled to claim damages.  Mozambique sued the investment bank last year, alongside a number of other defendants, in a bid to cancel the guarantee and seek compensation for losses related to the debt saga, which tipped its economy into crisis.  Credit Suisse rejected Mozambique’s arguments in its defense papers and submitted a counter claim, dated Jan. 21, requesting the court declare the guarantee binding and arguing it is entitled to seek interest and damages, namely the money it says it is owed.   “The claims against CSI and CSLB are denied in their entirety,” the papers said, referring to Credit Suisse International and its London branch. “CSI and CSLB are not liable to pay any damages, compensation or indemnity.” Credit Suisse and Russia’s VTB () bank provided or helped arrange financing, granted in 2013 and 2014, for a project spanning tuna fishing, maritime security and shipyard development, which U.S. authorities now say was an elaborate front for a bribery and kickback scheme. Hundreds of millions of dollars went missing.  Mozambique is trying to claim hefty sums that the country has paid or still owes under the agreements, which also included an $850 million eurobond, now restructured, and a $535 million loan from VTB (), as well as compensation for economic losses.  A series of court cases spanning three continents has ensnared three former Credit Suisse bankers, Mozambique’s former finance minister and its former president’s son. However, Mozambique’s action against Credit Suisse is the only one to target the bank itself.  The country says Credit Suisse employees, and therefore the bank, knew that large bribes were being paid and that guarantees for the loans exceeded limits set out in law, or were wilfully blind to it.  Mozambique’s Attorney General’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  VTB earlier this month lodged its own lawsuit in Britain’s High Court suing a Mozambique state-owned company over the $535 million loan. All of the lending for the project was guaranteed by Mozambique’s government, though some of it was not disclosed. The International Monetary Fund and other donors cut off support to Mozambique when the additional borrowing came to light in 2016, triggering a currency collapse and debt default it is yet to fully recover from.

"DAVOS-BlackRock, partners eye initial $500 mln for climate fund",Jan 22 2020,"* Climate Finance Partnership plans infrastructure fund * BlackRock takes first-loss tranche of at least $100 mln * To invest at least a quarter of capital in Africa By Simon Jessop and Sinead Cruise LONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - A BlackRock-backed group aims to raise an initial $500 million for a private equity fund that will invest in climate change-linked infrastructure upgrades in emerging markets. BlackRock will provide the first $100 million of funding for the Climate Finance Partnership (CFP), which was set up in 2018 by France, Germany and the Hewlett and Grantham charitable foundations, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. The BlackRock funding will go toward a first-loss tranche that will absorb any initial losses, a safety net for other institutional investors which BlackRock expects to help it raise at least another $400 million. The CFP fund will be invested in renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy storage solutions and ultra-low and electric transport. At least a quarter of the investments would be made in Africa, with the rest in selected countries in South East Asia and Latin America, BlackRock said. The venture is part of a wide-ranging overhaul of the way BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, is responding to the issue of climate change, as part of a broader commitment to environmental, social and governance-related investing. In a recent annual letter to the thousands of companies in which BlackRock holds stakes, Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said the need to act was “particularly urgent” given many cities were not built to withstand “the new climate reality”. Climate has also been at the forefront of this year’s annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, at which news of the planned initial fund-raising is set to be announced. “We believe creative collaboration is essential to mobilizing investment into climate infrastructure in emerging markets at scale, providing our clients with further opportunity to invest in the global low-carbon transition,” Brian Deese, Global Head of Sustainable Investing at BlackRock, said in the statement. France and Germany will both invest $30 million of the initial funding, while the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental Trust have pledged $10 million and $7.5 million, respectively. The CFP members have pledged to help raise the additional seed capital for the fund. BlackRock will invest an as yet determined amount in addition to the funding for the first-loss tranche.

"France, U.S. agree to push global 'digital tax' talks forward",Jan 23 2020,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - France and the United States agreed on Thursday how to press ahead with a global rewrite of cross-border tax rules for the digital era, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said. Le Maire said he and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had set aside a bilateral dispute over France’s digital tax on big tech companies to focus on securing a broader global deal this year that would include a minimal corporate tax rate. The two hammered out a series of written proposals for the first redrafting of international tax rules since the 1920s that will be put to 137 governments when discussions start next week at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. “We had long talks this morning with the U.S. Treasury Secretary and the OECD Secretary General, and I am happy to announce to you that we have found an agreement between France and the United States, providing the basis for work on digital taxation at the OECD,” Le Maire said at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos. “It’s good news, because it reduces the risk of American sanctions and opens up the prospect of an international solution on digital taxation,” he added. Preparations led in part by France and the United States to launch the OECD talks had been eclipsed by their bilateral row with Washington threatening retaliatory tariffs against Paris’ own national tax on big tech companies that book out-sized profits on French income, despite a minimal physical presence. U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron had discussed the issue in a phone call on Sunday. OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria has been working for years on finding ways to create a level playing field on digital taxation. Those efforts are now being accelerated to see if an agreement can be reached by December. Speaking on a panel at Davos with Le Maire, Gurria said he was hopeful of securing a draft framework by July. “We have no Plan B — we just have to get it done,” he said. Other countries including Italy and Britain are also pursuing or imposing their own national digital-tax regimes. Le Maire said it was preferable to have an international framework rather than a proliferation of national digital taxes. France has said it will scrap its own tax if an international accord can be reached. “So we have to build something different and that’s exactly what we want to do during 2020.” France’s existing digital tax is based on turnover. But Le Maire admitted that was not optimal from an economic point of view, saying the OECD’s plan to tax profits was more sound. There will be intense discussion over what level of profit would be taxed and how it would be collected. After meeting Mnuchin, Le Maire said a U.S. proposal that any deal be optional for companies was no longer on the table. ","{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.853, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.988}",0.988
M&A strong though Chinese buyers lacking: Citigroup's Kalvaria,Jan 23 2020,"(Reuters) - Geopolitical uncertainties are not deterring Citigroup Inc clients from strategic deals and some unicorns’ offer “great potential”, but outbound Chinese buyers are lacking, Leon Kalvaria, chairman of the lender’s institutional clients group said.  Kalvaria also told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Thursday that Citi’s overall market share across advisory, syndicate lending, equity and debt origination rose in 2019, but  attracting and retaining talent is challenging in the business. Below are excerpts from the chat, held on the sidelines of  the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland:  Question (Q) - Is geopolitical uncertainty keeping some corporate clients, who would otherwise be looking for deals or other financing, on the sidelines?  Answer (A) - I don’t think geopolitical uncertainties are affecting clients who are looking to do strategic transactions. However, that said, obviously outbound mergers and acquisitions (M&A) from China has gone down considerably, but other cross border M&A remains reasonably strong.   Q - Many of Citigroup’s competitors are going down market to look for growth since there is more competition for the biggest deals but fewer of them. Why hasn’t Citi followed suit?   A - We are not going down market because we do not believe that’s the right phraseology. What we are doing is spending significant time on smaller emerging growth companies, which we believe, over time, will be winners within their sub-sectors. Those companies are candidates for initial public offerings, merger and acquisition (M&A) opportunities and other potential services that we can bring to bear as they grow globally.  Q - How has the era of “unicorns” changed the way Citigroup sources new clients?  A - The era of unicorns relates to the earlier question about covering smaller companies. The unicorn valuations help highlight companies with great potential for us to cover and are very helpful in the areas we should invest in from the people standpoint.  Q - In 2018, Citi’s overall market share across advisory, syndicate lending and equity and debt origination rose to 5.1%, from 4.9%. How is the effort to capture more market share progressing and what are the biggest hurdles?   A - We continue to increase market share in 2019 slowly and carefully. The hurdles remain in retaining and attracting the best talent. This is a people business and we have to ensure that we have the best. Q - How will the corporate banking landscape change, given recent consolidation in the capital markets industry. Will fewer players in equity or debt impact the other corporate banking business lines?  A - Corporate banking business will remain a broad global business. Obviously the big 3 American corporate banks continue to enjoy a very strong position in the marketplace and remain very strong. But they (face) competition from leading banks in Asia and Europe.  In terms of fixed income and equities, some players have retreated to some extent and that has given other players the opportunity to pick up market share.

Trump is breakfasting with business leaders including Apple CEO Tim Cook before one-on-one meetings with the President of the Kurdistan Regional Government and then the President of Iraq. Air Force One is expected to be wheels up before 1200 GMT. Trump’s impeachment trial resumes at 1800 GMT. Britain’s heir to the throne Prince Charles addresses Davos at 1340 GMT with a focus on the environment, while the world is desperate to hear more about the future of the British monarchy after his son Harry and daughter-in-law Megan decided to quit the family firm. The star of Davos Greta Thunberg is expected to have dinner with other young activists. The World Economic Forum has had an injection of youthful energy this year with young attendees taking center stage. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai will be talking at 0915 GMT about artificial intelligence. Pichai put Google’s name behind a EU proposal to ban facial recognition technology on Monday, citing concerns that it could be used for nefarious purposes. That was met with a cool response by Microsoft CEO Brad Smith, who is also at Davos. Smith likened the ban to using a meat cleaver to solve the problem. Iraqi president Barham Salih speaks at 1700 GMT after meeting with Trump in the morning. President Barham Salih is expected to appoint a new premier this week to replace outgoing prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, who was forced out by demonstrators who continue to clash with police. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin makes another appearance in a panel on the future of financial markets at 0930 GMT. Market watchers will be keeping an eye out for anything else Mnuchin has to say about phase 2 of the China trade deal or the European digital tax.

The Greta and Trump show - Davos highlights on Tuesday,Jan 22 2020,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) kicked off on Tuesday in the ski town of Davos.  Here are the highlights from Day 1: Greta Thunberg and U.S. President Donald Trump dominated as they both attempted to frame arguments around climate change. Speaking thousand miles away from where his impeachment trial was due to start, Trump backed a tree planting initiative and dismissed the “perennial prophets of doom” on climate change. Trump did not name Thunberg, but she was sitting in the audience and responded less than an hour later in a packed auditorium. “Our house is still on fire,” Thunberg said, repeating her warning at the WEF meeting a year ago. “Your inaction is fuelling the flames,” the 17-year-old added, in the latest to-and-fro with the 73-year-old president. Often seen as the preserve of rich, old men, this year’s Davos has been invigorated by fresh voices, energy and Doc Martens with many young activists following their role model Thunberg up the Alps. The first panel of the four-day gathering made clear the shift, with a combined age of 64, much younger than the WEF’s 81-year-old founder Klaus Schwab. Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam and “Team HK”, including its trade secretary, top officials from the stock exchange, airport authority, MTR Corp and the head of Swire Group, are on a mission to reassure after a Moody’s downgrade this week. Lam sought to convince global business and political leaders that the Asian financial hub is open for business.  Apple chief executive Tim Cook will attend a breakfast meeting with Trump on Wednesday. On Tuesday evening Trump was to dine with several CEOs in a meeting organized with the help of Trump’s adviser and daughter, Ivanka Trump, a source familiar with the situation said. Saudi finance minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told Reuters on the sidelines of Davos that the proceeds of last month’s listing of oil giant Saudi Aramco would be pumped into the local economy over several years, including building up defense systems. With nearly $30 billion coming from Aramco’s local share offering last month, new and existing local industries, including defense and technology, will get a boost, Jadaan said. David Solomon, Goldman Sachs chief executive: “If you bought a package of all the IPOs that came to market in 2019 I think you returned 34% and outperformed the broader market a little bit.

Dutch power firm TenneT sets up unit focused on EU green targets,Jan 23 2020,"Berlin (Reuters) - Dutch-German power grid company TenneT is setting up a new business unit focused on the European Union’s “Green New Deal” project to make the bloc carbon-neutral by 2050. Chief Executive Manon van Beek told Reuters the new energy systems unit would be tasked with spotting opportunities to raise efficiency and improve cross-border planning.  TenneT, owned by the Dutch state, is already the largest investor in Germany’s shift towards renewable energy. “The unit will start in the second quarter and will have around 50 employees,” van Beek said at a conference. “That also involves partnerships with gas grid operators, like the one with (Dutch peer) Gasunie,” she added. The department will be headed by a German national, Peter Hoffmann, currently senior manager system operations. TenneT’s investments in Germany are financed by grid fees that are charged to electricity consumers. That puts its activities under the scrutiny of the energy regulator, which seeks to cut customer bills. Massive costs are stretching the company’s ability to keep up with the runaway expansion of power from volatile renewable sources, such as wind and sunshine. It has published a 35-billion euros ($36 billion) ten-year investment programme for the Netherlands and Germany, including  new underground and sea cables to carry green power. Renewables have grown to account for about 40% of Germany’s power generation, with 65% being the 2030 target. “For some 2030 is a long way out, for us it’s basically tomorrow,” van Beek said. Costs to keep networks stable are another burden. Staff and equipment must be in place to cope with the intermittency of renewables supplies, as new grids are only being built slowly. TenneT in 2019 incurred 925 million euros in grid handling costs in Germany, a sum similar to 2018, van Beek said. This was made up to 555 million euros for dealing with surplus wind, 180 million for so-called redispatch measures, and the rest for readying network reserves and standby capacity. These steps are necessary because grids must be balanced and there is not yet enough storage for surpluses. “I don’t see the magnitude of those costs changing much in the coming years,” van Beek said. She added that she expected by the summer an agreement with the Dutch finance minister on how to plug a 2-3 billion euros additional equity funding gap to secure the 10-year spending plan. “We want to keep our credit rating,” she said.

EU lending arm EIB set to keep tight Turkey restrictions in place,Jan 21 2020,"LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union’s lending arm, the European Investment Bank, expects to keep its lending heavily restricted in Turkey this year, as an EU row with Ankara over oil and gas drilling off Cyprus rumbles on. The EIB was one of Turkey’s biggest sources of financing last decade, pumping almost 19 billion euros into the country, but all but turned off the taps last year when diplomatic tensions over the drilling worsened. It stopped lending to infrastructure projects or any firm with links to the Turkish government but kept open the option to lend to parts of the private sector.  The drilling row has again deteriorated. Turkey’s energy minister said on Friday a new drilling ship was about to set off for Cyprus, and EU foreign affairs commissioner Josep Borrell said on Monday sanctions were in the works. Asked about the EIB’s lending restrictions, a spokesman for the bank said it would continue to act “in line with the approach adopted by EU Member States and the EU Commission.” “Unless there is a change in direction at EU level, we will probably maintain the selective approach (to lending in Turkey) we have had in the past couple of years, at least for the foreseeable future,” he said.  The EIB’s website shows it has approved only one loan in Turkey since last July’s announcement that it was reviewing its work there.  There is also friction over the creation of a ‘buffer zone’ inside Syria, from where Turkey had feared another cross-border exodus of refugees to join the 3.5 million already in Turkey.   The EIB disbursed over 52 billion euros ($57.31 billion) last year but lent only 117 million euros in Turkey, its figures show. This compared to more than 2 billion euros lent in Turkey in all but one of the years between 2009 and 2016. Its overall Turkish exposure is about 15 billion euros. Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said in November the EU’s  sanctions resolutions over the drilling were “null and void” and that Turkey had started another set of operations south of the Karpas peninsula.

EU to add vetting of climate results to fiscal monitoring,Jan 21 2020,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission will this year begin to assess the green transition of EU states as part of its monitoring of national budgets, a top official said, in a new sign of the bloc’s commitment to meet ambitious climate goals. The commission is responsible for making sure member countries do not overspend public resources. It annually assesses whether governments’ spending, revenues and investments are reasonably balanced and do not excessively flout debt and deficit ceilings set in EU rules. Worried that environmental and other climate-related costs could worsen governments’ fiscal positions, the commission will now also check the pace of governments’ transition toward a carbon-neutral economy by 2050. “For the first time in the commission’s economic monitoring of national budgets we will have a green variable, which is very important,” EU economics commissioner Paolo Gentiloni told reporters. He said European finance ministers would discuss the matter at meetings in Brussels that were underway and would continue on Tuesday. “It’s a change of perspective. When we assess budgets we need to look at expenditures, investments, but also at the results and pace of the green transition,” he added. It is unclear how this new attention to the fiscal impact of climate policies could change the way Brussels puts pressure on states to correct their fiscal policies. The commission could adopt a more benign approach to countries’ investments in renewable energies or other measures to reduce carbon emissions. Low-growth, high-debt Italy is asking for that spending to be allowed even when a country’s deficit or debt is already above EU limits. Gentiloni, a former socialist prime minister of Italy who became EU commissioner in December, is heeding that call. But a decision on how to treat green investments has not been made yet, an EU official said. That could come as part of a review of EU fiscal rules that Brussels plans to unveil in February. France, Italy and other southern countries of the bloc are keen to soften the rules, seen by many as excessively rigid and complicated. That could spur growth and favor the green transition, supporters of the move say. But Germany has so far resisted changes, fearing fiscal leeway could unleash uncontrolled spending in some countries and cause financial crises.

EXPLAINER-Can Lebanon's new government revive the economy?,Jan 23 2020,"(Repeats with amended slug; no changes to text) By Tom Arnold BEIRUT, Jan 22 (Reuters) - After three months of political paralysis, Lebanon has finally formed a government under Prime Minister Hassan Diab. Now comes the task of saving the country from a biting financial crisis and winning over investors and foreign donors. Lebanon’s public debt burden, equivalent to around 150% of GDP, and its twin current account and fiscal deficits looked unsustainable even before anti-government protesters took to the streets three months ago. With many of the international sovereign bonds trading at less than half their face value, market observers see an increasing likelihood of Lebanon struggling to repay some of its obligations and seek a restructuring with creditors at some point. One of the first tasks of the government will be to decide whether to proceed with a central bank proposal to ask local holders of some of this year’s bonds, including a $1.2 billion issue maturing in March, to swap them for longer-dated ones to ease pressure on state finances. Any move to delay bond repayments could constitute a default in the eyes of credit rating agencies and risk pushing its credit rating further into junk territory. The Lebanese pound’s 22-year-old peg to the U.S. dollar has been strained to near breaking point by the country’s political and banking crisis. With the pound losing roughly a third of its official value on the black market as dollars have dried up, a devaluation has loomed increasingly large. Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh has previously ruled out any such move, saying the government has the means to maintain the peg. But without a revival in sagging capital flows and a recovery in Lebanon’s external balance sheet, the central bank’s ability to defend the peg will diminish. Banks have long served as a vital cog in keeping Lebanon’s economy moving. By taking deposits from Lebanon’s millions of scattered diaspora and snapping up the government’s local debt, banks helped prop up the state’s finances. But that system has broken as foreign deposits dry up in the face of a collapse in confidence in the banking system. Non-resident private sector deposits in the banking sector fell by 11.3% on an annual basis in November, while Lebanon faces a hard currency shortage - leaving Lebanese at home and abroad with restricted access to their bank funds. Some financial experts believe banks will require a deeper injection of cash than the 20% of capital they’ve been told by the central bank to raise. Lebanon is mired in recession and its recovery remains largely dependent on the government’s ability to make reforms needed to secure international financial support. Lebanon needs a $20 billion-$25 billion bailout including International Monetary Fund support to emerge from its financial crisis, according to former economy minister Nasser Saidi. But assistance appears uncertain given Diab’s support from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its allies. Diab has said his first trip abroad would be to the Arab region, particularly Gulf states. But Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have provided financial aid to Lebanon in the past, have appeared more circumspect during the latest crisis and may be even less willing to stump up with Diab in power. Instead, Lebanon may look to Qatar, accused by its Gulf neighbours of more closely aligning itself with Iran. It is unclear whether Diab will try to pursue an IMF bailout. Some observers warn the United States, the largest financial backer of those institutions, could oppose any such deal due to the government’s Hezbollah ties. The United States regards Hezbollah as a terrorist group. ","{'neg': 0.115, 'neu': 0.816, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': -0.9792}",-0.9792
Egypt's economic outlook improves in 2020-Reuters Poll,Jan 23 2020,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt’s economy is likely to grow 5.8% in the current fiscal year ending on June 30, and 5.9% in 2020/21, according to a Reuters poll - an improvement on the previous poll three months ago. The median of forecasts from 20 economists polled from Jan. 7 to 21 aligns with the 5.8%-5.9% growth forecast by the finance ministry for 2019/20 on Monday. In 2018/19, GDP grew 5.6%. In October, analysts had projected the economy would expand by only 5.5% in 2019/20 and 5.7% in 2020/21. “We expect a slight increase in household consumption accompanied by higher exports and lower imports,” Naeem Brokerage Allen Sandeep said, explaining the more optimistic outlook. Egypt’s economy has been boosted in the last three years by an upswing in tourism, strong remittances from Egyptian workers abroad and recently discovered natural gas fields coming onstream. But the growth has mainly been driven by the state sector, with the non-oil private sector having contracted every month this fiscal year apart from July, according to the IHS Markit Egypt Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI). In fact, non-oil private sector growth has expanded in only six individual months since a 2016 economic reform programme tied to a $12 billion three-year International Monetary Fund accord, according to the PMI data. Completed in November, the program was designed to reduce Egypt’s budget and current account deficits. The reforms included letting the Egyptian pound depreciate sharply, removing almost all fuel subsidies, introducing a value-added tax and raising electricity and transport prices. The analysts expected Egypt’s annual urban consumer price inflation to slow to 6.8% in 2019/20 but to rebound to 7.5% in 2020/21 and 8.0% the following year. In July 2017, months after the IMF-inspired austerity measures kicked in, inflation peaked at 33%.  Egypt reported that inflation had increased by an annual 7.1% in December after having slowed to as little as 3.1% in October.  “December 2019’s inflation print confirms our expectation that prices will continue to accelerate in months to come as favorable base effects diminish,” said Callee Davis of NKC African.  The median analyst forecast had the Egyptian pound weakening to 16.10 to the U.S. dollar by the end of June from 15.80 on Thursday. It will slide further to 16.50 by June 2021 and 17.08 by June 2022, the analysts predicted. Davis forecast that the currency’s strong appreciation over the last 12 months would begin to reverse this coming April 2020, when a $1 billion Eurobond repayment is scheduled.  The poll also suggested that the central bank would lower its key overnight lending rates, currently 13.25%, to 11.75% in 2020 and 10.75% in 2021 and 2022. Last week, the bank left its overnight interest rates unchanged after cutting them at each of its previous three meetings.

Exclusive: Giuliani told U.S. his client deserves leniency for financing Venezuela's opposition - Parnas,Jan 22 2020,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - At a lavish August gathering at a private estate in Spain, a wealthy Venezuelan businessman under criminal investigation in the United States introduced Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, to the father of Venezuela’s opposition leader, Juan Guaido. The affair was part of a campaign for leniency for the businessman, Alejandro Betancourt, who sought to demonstrate his close ties to opposition figures looking to oust Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolas Maduro - a key objective of the Trump administration. Betancourt told Giuliani he secretly helped bankroll Guaido’s efforts to take over the leadership of Venezuela, according to four people familiar with the situation, two of whom provided  details about the meeting in Spain. Betancourt hoped those bona fides would enable Giuliani, his lawyer, to persuade Trump’s Justice Department to drop its probe of Betancourt in connection with a Florida money laundering and bribery case, the people said. A month later, at a meeting in Washington, D.C., Giuliani urged Justice Department prosecutors to go easy on Betancourt, according to a person with direct knowledge of the meeting, and Lev Parnas, a former Giuliani associate, who said Giuliani told him about it soon afterward. Parnas and the other person said Giuliani told prosecutors that Betancourt had provided assistance for Guaido’s political efforts, and was therefore doing good work for the United States. This is the first time Parnas detailed his story about Betancourt, Giuliani and Venezuela. Giuliani declined to confirm meeting with U.S. prosecutors on Betancourt’s behalf and wouldn’t say whether the Venezuelan businessman is a client. “Lev Parnas has no right to be talking about that meeting,” Giuliani told Reuters in a brief phone interview. “It was a confidential meeting - if it did happen.” “Lev Parnas’s credibility is worth nothing,” Giuliani said. The Justice Department declined to comment. Betancourt and his attorney Frank Wohl did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Reuters couldn’t determine whether Betancourt did provide financing to the U.S.-backed opposition or if he was just claiming he did. Guaido and the main opposition political party, Popular Will, both denied receiving funding from Betancourt. Guaido was a member of Popular Will until he stepped back from it earlier this month. “I do not know Mr. Betancourt, there is no relationship,” Guaido told Reuters. “As such, that is not possible.” Wilmer Guaido, Guaido’s father, denied meeting Betancourt in Spain. “I only support my son like the whole family against that criminal dictatorship but I have not met anyone,” he said. Giuliani’s meeting with Betancourt at the Spanish estate, and his efforts to lobby the Justice Department on the businessman’s behalf, were previously reported by the Washington Post. Reuters is the first to report that Betancourt told Giuliani that he provided financial support for Venezuela’s opposition, and that Giuliani touted that alleged assistance to U.S. prosecutors as a reason to remove the legal cloud dogging his client. The episode speaks to the complex roles that Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, has played in Washington since Trump took office in 2017. Giuliani frequently proclaims himself a business consultant and lawyer working on behalf of private clients. Yet he also enjoys extraordinary access to the halls of power as the president’s unpaid personal attorney - work that has landed him at the center of Trump’s impeachment trial. Any attempt by a Giuliani client to avoid possible prosecution by claiming to have been backing an American foreign policy objective - the toppling of Maduro in this case - could prove embarrassing to the administration. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Parnas played a key role in Giuliani’s effort to dig up dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in Ukraine for Trump. Now under indictment for campaign finance violations, Parnas has been sharing information with Capitol Hill impeachment investigators, as well as the media, about the extent of the work he did for Giuliani. Betancourt said “he was backing Guaido financially,” Parnas told Reuters, and “was helping America with his cause.” Since January 2019, the United States and dozens of other countries have recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful president. But Maduro has remained firmly in power, much to the frustration of the Trump administration. Maduro’s government cut off paychecks for opposition lawmakers in 2016 after the opposition took control of the National Assembly. Claims that Betancourt helped finance his country’s opposition are potentially explosive in Venezuela, where the mogul forged a profitable relationship with the socialist government. Derwick Associates, his Caracas-based energy firm, obtained hundreds of millions of dollars in state contracts to build power plants under Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez, according to local media. In a statement to Reuters, the opposition Popular Will party said that “information about the supposed remittance of funds by Alejandro Betancourt to our political organization is not true.” The existence of the U.S. criminal probe of Betancourt was confirmed to Reuters by a source familiar with the matter.  The Miami Herald reported last November that the investigation is linked to a large money laundering case in Miami, and that Betancourt is an unindicted co-conspirator listed, but not named, in legal records. The 2018 charges accused eight defendants of embezzling $1.2 billion from Venezuela’s government-owned oil company PDVSA, then laundering it through schemes in Miami involving false real estate and security deals. A representative of Betancourt who declined to be identified said the magnate “didn’t do anything and he has not been charged with any wrongdoing.” He also told Reuters that the businessman had provided “very substantial” financial support to Venezuela’s opposition. PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment. At the State Department, Elliott Abrams, the U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela, told Reuters the administration is aware of the lack of transparency in the opposition’s financing.  “We’re concerned about who are all these people, and how did they make their money. And that is something we have raised with the opposition,” Abrams said. Asked whether Betancourt was one of those individuals of concern, Abrams said: “No comment on individual names.” He added that Giuliani had not been authorized to play any role in U.S. policy in Venezuela. Parnas said the August meeting at Betancourt’s estate outside Madrid, and the presence of Guaido’s father, were meant to demonstrate Betancourt’s strong ties to Guaido and his support for U.S. interests in Venezuela. It was to show Giuliani “that Betancourt is a really important person for the cause and that he is helping America,” Parnas said. The lobbying took place in Washington the month after the Spain meeting. Giuliani met with Assistant U.S. Attorney General Brian Benczkowski, a Justice Department lawyer working on the case, and some other government lawyers, according to Parnas and the person with direct knowledge of that meeting. Department of Justice spokesman Peter Carr, who handles communications for Benczkowski, said the department declined to comment.  The person said Giuliani was there with two other Betancourt lawyers, and made his pitch that the prosecutors let Betancourt off the hook for the case in Florida. Giuliani first insisted there wasn’t enough evidence to prosecute the case. He then moved to U.S. foreign policy, pointing to Betancourt’s alleged support for Guaido. “This guy’s been helping the United States,” the person with direct knowledge of the meeting said in describing Giuliani’s reasoning. Giuliani argued that Betancourt was crucial to the survival of the Venezuelan opposition, and he urged the Justice Department lawyers to talk to Guaido themselves to corroborate his claims, the person said.

Exclusive: India's HDFC Bank taps Egon Zehnder to identify Aditya Puri's successor,Jan 23 2020,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s HDFC Bank () has chosen global executive search firm Egon Zehnder to identify a successor to managing director Aditya Puri, the country’s top private lender said on Thursday. Reuters had reported earlier on Thursday that the HDFC Bank board had tapped the global head-hunting firm in a bid to end a boardroom impasse over Puri’s successor and zero in on a candidate. Four sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters that a six-member internal search committee, appointed in November last year, has been unable to reach a consensus on selecting a successor to Puri, who has been at the helm of HDFC Bank since its inception in 1994. “Egon Zehnder has been recommended by the search committee and unanimously appointed by the bank’s board,” Neeraj Jha, a spokesman for HDFC Bank, said in an email. Puri, whose term comes to an end in October this year, is also an adviser to the search committee.  “The latest decision to hire a global advisory firm has been taken after the search committee members realized that they have been struggling to come to a consensus on the final name,” said a source familiar with the internal deliberations among members of the committee.  “The deadline for Puri’s successor is nearing ... the bank will have to appoint someone who can continue to push for growth despite an economic slowdown,” the source added. According to HDFC Bank, Puri is 69 years old.  As per regulations, the bank will need to get approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), before any new appointment can be confirmed. HDFC Bank is one of three domestic lenders that the central bank has designated as “too big to fail”.   Egon Zehnder, which declined to comment on the matter, had in 2018 also helped Axis Bank (), another private lender, to find its chief executive officer.  A second source at HDFC said the differences between the top leadership over the succession has been the crucial reason for the delay in identifying a new managing director. The sources said Puri and Deepak Parekh, the chairman of India’s largest housing finance company HDFC () which owns a minority stake in the bank, have been at loggerheads over the bank’s succession plan, with both advocating their preferred candidates to secure the job. Puri’s preferred choices include HDFC Bank’s executive directors Bhavesh Zaveri, Sashidhar Jagdishan and Kaizad Bharucha, said three of the sources. Two of those sources also said Parekh has been rooting to reinstate Paresh Sukhtankar, who resigned as Puri’s deputy in 2018.  Sukhtankar, who joined the bank alongside Puri in 1994 was widely expected to be Puri’s successor. Reasons behind his departure remain unclear. Regarding questions about names in the fray and differences between Puri and Parekh, HDFC Bank’s Jha said that “information is speculative and incorrect”.  Parekh and Puri personally did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. Sources said the search committee, in a bid to defuse the tension, had also contacted top banking executives working overseas to find a candidate acceptable to Puri and Parekh. The board members held preliminary discussions with Indian-origin bankers Piyush Gupta, CEO of DBS Group (), and Ajay Banga, CEO of Mastercard Inc (), about the job, two of the sources said.  The outcome of these discussions was unclear. A spokesman at DBS Group told Reuters in an email that “Piyush is happy at DBS and has no plans to leave”. Seth Eisen, senior vice president of communications at Mastercard, said Banga has not had any conversation with HDFC Bank regarding the position. Analysts tracking the bank said Puri has run it with an iron hand, preventing it from accruing a high level of bad loans at a time when most of its peers were struggling.  “The new successor needs to have a vision to be able to spot opportunities and constantly stay ahead of the curve which is what Puri has been doing,” said Suresh Ganapathy, head of financial services research at Macquarie. Puri, the highest paid banker in India with remuneration of 136.7 million rupees ($1.92 million) excluding stock options, had been seeking another term as managing director, two of the sources said. However, the central bank has been firm that chief executives of private banks must retire at the age of 70. ","{'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.904, 'pos': 0.065, 'compound': 0.9493}",0.9493
Explainer: Can Lebanon's new government revive the economy?,Jan 23 2020,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - After three months of political paralysis, Lebanon has finally formed a government under Prime Minister Hassan Diab. Now comes the task of saving the country from a biting financial crisis and winning over investors and foreign donors. Lebanon’s public debt burden, equivalent to around 150% of GDP, and its twin current account and fiscal deficits looked unsustainable even before anti-government protesters took to the streets three months ago.  With many of the international sovereign bonds trading at less than half their face value, market observers see an increasing likelihood of Lebanon struggling to repay some of its obligations and seek a restructuring with creditors at some point. One of the first tasks of the government will be to decide whether to proceed with a central bank proposal to ask local holders of some of this year’s bonds, including a $1.2 billion issue maturing in March, to swap them for longer-dated ones to ease pressure on state finances. Any move to delay bond repayments could constitute a default in the eyes of credit rating agencies and risk pushing its credit rating further into junk territory.  The Lebanese pound’s 22-year-old peg to the U.S. dollar has been strained to near breaking point by the country’s political and banking crisis. With the pound losing roughly a third of its official value on the black market as dollars have dried up, a devaluation has loomed increasingly large. Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh has previously ruled out any such move, saying the government has the means to maintain the peg. But without a revival in sagging capital flows and a recovery in Lebanon’s external balance sheet, the central bank’s ability to defend the peg will diminish. Banks have long served as a vital cog in keeping Lebanon’s economy moving. By taking deposits from Lebanon’s millions of scattered diaspora and snapping up the government’s local debt, banks helped prop up the state’s finances. But that system has broken as foreign deposits dry up in the face of a collapse in confidence in the banking system. Non-resident private sector deposits in the banking sector fell by 11.3% on an annual basis in November, while Lebanon faces a hard currency shortage - leaving Lebanese at home and abroad with restricted access to their bank funds. Some financial experts believe banks will require a deeper injection of cash than the 20% of capital they’ve been told by the central bank to raise. Lebanon is mired in recession and its recovery remains largely dependent on the government’s ability to make reforms needed to secure international financial support. Lebanon needs a $20 billion-$25 billion bailout including International Monetary Fund support to emerge from its financial crisis, according to former economy minister Nasser Saidi. But assistance appears uncertain given Diab’s support from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its allies. Diab has said his first trip abroad would be to the Arab region, particularly Gulf states. But Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have provided financial aid to Lebanon in the past, have appeared more circumspect during the latest crisis and may be even less willing to stump up with Diab in power. Instead, Lebanon may look to Qatar, accused by its Gulf neighbors of more closely aligning itself with Iran.  It is unclear whether Diab will try to pursue an IMF bailout. Some observers warn the United States, the largest financial backer of those institutions, could oppose any such deal due to the government’s Hezbollah ties. The United States regards Hezbollah as a terrorist group. ","{'neg': 0.114, 'neu': 0.816, 'pos': 0.07, 'compound': -0.9764}",-0.9764
Door-knocking neighbors help avert home seizures in Detroit,Jan 21 2020,"WASHINGTON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Delores Orr was going door-to-door helping her Detroit neighbors deal with the effects of one of the nation’s worst tax foreclosure crises, she was shocked at how many people didn’t know their homes were in danger or what to do about it. As it turned out, that included her. Orr, 72, was working with the Neighbor to Neighbor program when it launched in 2017, joining a group of 450 people who went around their communities to alert homeowners and renters whose property taxes were in arrears. When, as part of the canvassing, she was given a list of properties at risk of foreclosure, she saw her own address among them. “I said, wait a minute, that’s my house!” exclaimed the lifelong Detroit resident. The home she and her brother had inherited from their mother, Orr discovered, had come with $3,000 in back taxes they didn’t know about. “You would never believe how many people don’t know that their taxes were behind,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. For years following the 2008-2009 financial crisis, Detroit had been ravaged by property tax foreclosures, automatically triggered if someone misses their property tax payments for three years in a row. Between 2011 and 2015, a quarter of properties in the city were subject to foreclosure for unpaid property taxes, according to a 2018 study by the Chicago-Kent College of Law and Oakland University.   But foreclosures have fallen by more than 90% since their peak in 2015, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan announced on Jan. 8, pointing to Neighbor to Neighbor as a major player in turning that tide.  While the government was taking its own steps to alert and offer support to residents who were behind on their taxes, the process was confusing and time-consuming, noted community leaders. The biggest innovation in the fight against foreclosures, they said, was simply sending people door-to-door, talking with those at risk. “It’s a way of life of being a Detroiter, to hear somebody is losing their house to foreclosure,” said Ray Solomon, general manager for the city’s Department of Neighborhoods. “This is a problem that’s all hands on deck,” he said in a phone interview. FACE-TO-FACE Still reeling from the decline of the auto industry, Detroit has one of the highest property taxes in the country, which a 2016 study from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a U.S. think tank, found was linked to low property values.  With that has come significant tax delinquency. Citing county figures, Laura Grannemann, vice president of strategic investments with the Quicken Loans Community Fund, which runs Neighbor to Neighbor, noted that Detroit has seen 150,000 tax foreclosures over the past 15 years. That is “an extraordinary drain on homeownership,” she said. In Detroit, as in many cities, programs already existed to shield the most vulnerable from losing their homes to unpaid taxes. But many say the various forms of government support were not widely discussed and were complicated to apply for. “It wasn’t largely advertised, so you had to be in the know,” said Tracy Smith, a program manager with the Central Detroit Christian Community Development Corporation, a non-profit and Neighbor to Neighbor partner. And those who did find out often were already facing foreclosure, meaning they had already missed two or three years of tax payments and likely owed significant interest on that amount, she added over the phone. According to Grannemann, the idea behind Neighbor to Neighbor was both simple and desperate: make face-to-face contact with owners or tenants of all Detroit properties with delinquent taxes, well in advance of that dangerous third year. “We realized no one had gone door-to-door and asked people what their experience was,” she said. Armed with delinquency information from the public record, canvassers such as Orr spoke to residents about tax exemptions and other potential resources. Grannemann explained that the first Neighbor to Neighbor census saw people comb the streets for four months between 2017 and 2018, eventually contacting residents at all 60,000 properties that were chronically behind on their taxes.  The program did the same last year and is planning another census for this spring, she added. In its first census, Neighbor to Neighbor found that about 75% of the residents contacted that year qualified for exemptions, meaning they should not have been paying property taxes in the first place. Renters were the most vulnerable, the program found, with almost three-quarters of those contacted not knowing that the owners of the homes they were renting had not been paying taxes — and that they were at risk of eviction. Since the program started, Neighbor to Neighbor has been working with the city to enable renters in that situation to pay off the properties’ back taxes and even purchase the home themselves. In 2018, more than 500 renters ended up buying their homes through this initiative, Grannemann said. That year alone, the program helped more than 4,300 families avoid foreclosure, according to the latest data available. The program organizers also worked with local officials to streamline the applications processes for tax exemptions. Official data revealed that more than 7,600 Detroit residents took advantage of tax exemptions last year, up 30% from the previous year. Working with the program is helping the city get ahead of the foreclosure crisis, said Chelsea Neblett, a manager with the city’s Financial Empowerment Center, which gives free financial counseling to residents. “For a long time we were reactionary, assisting people in immediate danger,” she said by phone, noting that the city is also coming up with its own solutions for vulnerable residents. Neighbor to Neighbor is “allowing us to become more proactive.” Property taxes are rising in cities across the country and tax delinquency disproportionately affects minority households, said Alanna McCargo, vice president of housing finance policy at the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank. Efforts to resolve the problem should be a “top priority, so that foreclosure doesn’t happen,” she said in emailed comments. Grannemann of the Quicken Loans Community Fund said other cities are taking notice of the Neighbor to Neighbor program, and she and her colleagues have been in contact with local officials elsewhere to try out similar strategies. For Orr, meanwhile, the discovery that she might lose her house prompted her to panic. But through her work with Neighbor to Neighbor, she learned that she qualified for a full tax exemption going forward. She is now almost finished paying off the back taxes, and her daughter found out in December that she is likewise exempt. “It allowed me to breathe,” Orr said.

From Communist-era roots to cash cows: Poland's gaming industry takes on the world,Jan 23 2020,"WARSAW/PRAGUE (Reuters) - The drab exteriors of a pair of 1970s buildings in an industrial Warsaw neighborhood belie the hive of high-tech activity inside where developers, screenplay writers and others at leading video game maker CD Projekt hustle to create the next global hit.  Poland — Eastern Europe’s biggest economy — has quietly developed into a leading video game exporter thanks to low labor costs, a young educated workforce and a thriving gaming tradition rooted in the Communist era. After CD Projekt’s top-selling Witcher series put the country on the map, foreign investors are keenly searching for promising game developers in a fast-growing market. “People are starting to take notice of Poland,” said Borys Musielak, founding partner at U.S.-Polish venture capital firm SMOK Ventures, which is in talks with two Asian investors to fund local gaming companies and in January made its first such investment alongside a Finnish partner. “There have been mainly angel investors and some private equity but now global venture capital groups are looking into the region.” Poland’s booming video game and esports market was worth $664 million in 2019 — up from $400 million in 2014 — and is projected to climb to nearly $850 million over the next four years, according to data from PwC. The success of CD Projekt’s medieval fantasy world Witcher has been a key driver. Based on a series of best-selling Polish books and the basis for a Netflix show that premiered in December, the games have sold more than 40 million copies worldwide. The release later this year of the company’s first person futuristic adventure game “Cyberpunk 2077” is likely to sharpen focus on a sector in which eight companies listed on the main market of the Polish stock exchange between 2015 and 2019. On the NewConnect market — the bourse’s exchange for smaller companies — 21 debuted during the same period. “Historically, a lot of those companies chose the stock exchange to finance themselves because there were not many ways to raise capital,” said Mariusz Gasiewski, head of mobile gaming and apps at Google in Poland. “Now it is getting easier as more interest comes from abroad.” The combined value of the listed gaming companies leapt 82% to more than 32 billion zlotys ($8.36 billion) last year, led by CD Projekt, 11 bit studios, PlayWay and Ten Square Games, according to exchange data. Moreover, CD Projekt’s roughly 27 billion zloty valuation is rapidly catching up with that of Poland’s biggest company, refiner PKN Orlen, at 36 billion zlotys.   KNOW-HOW At CD Projekt — whose headquarters feature Silicon Valley perks such as a gym, film studio and open plan offices — the company has parlayed Poles’ love of video games into a global brand. “We have been working intensively on increasing the knowledge of CD Projekt among foreign investors,” the company’s  president and one of its founders Adam Kicinski told Reuters. “We are meeting with funds from around the world focusing on western markets, especially in the United States.” Bigger funding rounds and the tapping of international investors will help Polish companies compete with industry leaders from countries such as China, Japan and the U.S.. “Due to their know-how and appropriate budgets, foreign investors help those companies go from the stage where they create very good games to the absolute top,” said Stanislaw Just, a former board member of the Polish Games Association who recently started his own company. Flying Wild Hog, a smaller developer known for the Shadow Warrior series, was acquired by London-based Supernova Capital in 2019, while Artificer, which is working on its debut game, was bought by Dutch-based Good Shepherd Entertainment. Poland’s love of video games stems from the Communist era when students flocked to street markets to swap pirated games, building up a flourishing community. “For the previous generation, Rock & Roll was a ticket to the world we all dreamed of, then came the games and we all played to touch what was happening in the West,” said Grzegorz Miechowski, president of 11 bit studios, whose most popular title “Frostpunk” depicts a dystopian 19th Century England.  Nearly half of Poland’s 38 million population identify as gamers, while there are around 400 active gaming companies — dwarfing an estimated dozen in Germany — with some 100 Polish titles hitting the global market each year. The country hosts a popular international video game festival as well as one of the largest esports events in the world - the Intel Extreme Masters, which last year drew a record 232 million viewers worldwide. Miechowski also pointed to Poland’s education system which  churns out computer science savvy graduates eager to work in game development.  The government has taken notice too, doling out around 300 million zlotys through a European Union funded program — the fourth round of which is underway — to award developers early stage grants to help gaming projects get off the ground.

"Facing economic crisis, Lebanon's government weighs options",Jan 22 2020,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon’s Hezbollah-backed government will be walking a political tightrope as it looks to secure urgent foreign funding to ward off financial collapse, and it may look to the International Monetary Fund for assistance. Prime Minister Hassan Diab’s cabinet is also facing increasingly violent protests against a political elite that has led Lebanon into its worst crisis since the 1975-90 civil war. Formed by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its allies, the cabinet faces an economic crisis at a time when Gulf Arab states, who along with Washington label Hezbollah a terrorist group, appear no longer willing to bail out Lebanon.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a statement on the new government, did not refer to Hezbollah, but emphasized the need for reform and fighting corruption. “Only a government that is capable of and committed to undertaking real and tangible reforms will restore investor confidence and unlock international assistance for Lebanon,” Pompeo said.  President Michel Aoun tasked the government at its first meeting on Wednesday with restoring international confidence, which could unlock funding and ease a liquidity crunch that hit the Lebanese pound, fueled inflation and forced bank controls. A senior politician, Alain Aoun, told Reuters on Wednesday that an IMF program is an option for Lebanon depending on terms that should be bearable for the country and not trigger social unrest. On Wednesday, some protesters unhappy with the new cabinet breached a small security barricade near parliament in downtown Beirut and set on fire a tent for security forces, who responded with tear gas and water cannon. The skirmishes extended to a nearby luxury shopping district. A civil defense worker told local media some people suffered slight injuries. Last weekend, hundreds were injured in similar clashes. Lebanon had been without effective government since Saad al-Hariri, the country’s main Sunni Muslim leader and a traditional ally of the West and Gulf states, resigned as premier in October. Diab’s cabinet was formed on Tuesday by Hezbollah and allies, including the Free Patriotic Movement founded by Aoun, without the participation of major Lebanese political parties that enjoy Western support. Lebanon sovereign dollar-bonds moved higher by as much as 1 cent on Wednesday with the formation of a government.  Lebanon, burdened with a public debt equivalent to about 150% of GDP, won pledges exceeding $11 billion at an international conference in 2018 conditional on reforms that it has so far failed to implement.  “Your mission is delicate,” President Aoun’s office cited him as telling the cabinet. “It is necessary to work to tackle the economic situation, restore the confidence of the international community in Lebanese institutions and reassure the Lebanese about their future.” Diab has said his first trip abroad would be to the Gulf region - but he will have his work cut out to reassure U.S.-allied rulers there who are concerned about Hezbollah’s rising influence in Beirut.     Lebanon’s banking association said on Wednesday it expected the cabinet to put forward a clear economic and financial program, offering the banks’ support. A push by Lebanon to rein in a parallel market for dollars hit a snag on Wednesday when currency dealers largely refused to sell at a lower price agreed by the union of exchange dealers with the central bank. Highlighting challenges ahead, Finance Minister Ghazi Wazni told local media it was unlikely the Lebanese pound exchange rate to the U.S. dollar would “return to what it was” on the parallel market. Wazni had also described forthcoming foreign currency sovereign debt maturities as “a fireball”. Lebanon should restructure its Eurobonds, including a $1.2 billion Eurobond maturing in March, and secure a multi-billion-dollar IMF bailout, its former labor minister Camille Abousleiman told Reuters. “I don’t see the logic of the system leaking $500 to $600 million out of Lebanon on the March payment when an actual restructuring of the Eurobonds is next to inevitable.” ","{'neg': 0.103, 'neu': 0.782, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.9194}",0.9194
Foreigners net sellers of Japanese stocks for third straight week,Jan 23 2020,"Jan 23 (Reuters) - Foreign investors continued to sell Japanese equities for a third straight week in the week ended Jan. 17, even after the United States and China signed a trade deal to defuse their 18-month tariff war. Cross-border investors sold a net 281.69 billion yen ($2.57 billion) of Japanese stocks, including cash equities and futures, data from Japanese stock exchanges showed. They sold a net 356.8 billion yen in the derivatives markets, but purchased 75.1 billion yen in cash markets, according to the data.

France uses Davos to pursue global 'digital tax' goal,Jan 23 2020,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire is optimistic of reaching a deal on a global tax on digital companies, despite an initial failure to agree one with the United States. “We are moving in the right direction,” Le Maire told Reuters TV at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos on Thursday, adding that he thought France was close to striking an agreement with the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed the issue in a phone call on Sunday, with both sides sounding positive afterwards, in contrast to the threats the U.S. has made to impose tariffs on exports of champagne and other luxury goods in retaliation for a French digital tax. But Paris and Washington failed to agree on Wednesday on how to push forward on a deal that involves a rewriting of decades-old cross-border tax rules. They did, however, agree to set aside their squabbling as they work on the global initiative. This is being led by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a Paris-based club of wealthier economies.  OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria has been working for years on finding ways to create a level playing field on digital taxation, but those efforts are now being accelerated to see if an agreement can be reached by December. Speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum with Le Maire, Gurria said he was hopeful of having a framework that would apply to more than 130 countries drafted by July. “We have no Plan B — we just have to get it done,” he said. Le Maire has thrust France front and center of the digital taxation debate, despite the fact several countries, including Italy and Britain, are already pursuing or imposing their own national digital-tax regimes. “It would be far better to have an international framework for everybody,” Le Maire said on Thursday, adding that otherwise the world would end up with a cacophony of national systems that would compound the problem. “So we have to build something different and that’s exactly what we want to do during 2020, by building on the extremely good work being done (at the OECD).” France’s existing digital tax is based on turnover. But Le Maire admitted that was not optimal from an economic point of view, saying the OECD’s plan to tax profits was more sound. There will be intense discussion over what level of profit would be taxed and how it would be collected. “Everything is on the table,” Le Maire said. “We just have to decide if we want to avoid a loophole in the international taxation system or have many national solutions that would be detrimental to all of us.  “We just can’t go on any longer with a taxation system in which the richest companies, those that are making the biggest profits, are paying the least tax.” ","{'neg': 0.037, 'neu': 0.835, 'pos': 0.129, 'compound': 0.9904}",0.9904

French Finance minister sees global railway consolidation in 'coming years',Jan 23 2020,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday a consolidation in the global railway industry would occur in the “coming years”, amid speculation French company Alstom and Canada’s Bombardier () would combine their rail businesses. “Alstom is a very strong company, healthy and that’s why we have to think about the future of Alstom. But we are all aware that there will be a move in the direction of consolidation in the railway industry in the coming years”, Le Maire told Reuters TV at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos. Alstom shares hit a two-year high Wednesday following a report of a potential deal with Bombardier. Trainmakers have explored various combinations in recent years, with the idea of creating larger industry champions to head off competition from Chinese firms. Last year the European Union blocked a deal between Alstom and Germany’s Siemens () to merge their rail assets, highlighting some of the antitrust hurdles the sector faces. “I deeply regret that the merger between Siemens and Alstom did not go to the end because it was really a great purpose for all of us, for the European industry”, Le Maire said.

German energy shift will be like 'open-heart surgery': economy minister,Jan 21 2020,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s transition to a fossil-fuel free energy mix will be like undergoing “open-heart surgery” as the car, steel and renewable industries will need to work hard to stay competitive, its economy minister said on Tuesday. The German government has spurred Europe’s largest economy to shift to volatile renewable energy sources like wind and solar power in the wake of its decision to end nuclear power by 2022 and exit coal-fuelled power sources by 2038. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said Germany could in the meantime use natural gas as a transition fuel, tap into intra-European Union power sharing, and develop a green hydrogen-based economy that will offer energy storage and enable industry to work sustainably. “We have to keep fighting for our competitiveness,” Altmaier told an annual energy summit of government and industry leaders hosted by newspaper Handelsblatt. Germany’s efforts to wean itself off nuclear energy and coal could be an export model going forward, he said. “Climate protection and competitiveness are not a contradiction,” he said. The national hydrogen strategy will take shape shortly and may be presented within seven to eight weeks, he said, adding that this was especially important for steelmakers whose enormous CO2 emissions needed to come down in a cost-efficient way. “It is important that we have an idea of how the energy shift can be implemented, regardless of the economic situation,” he said. “It is like an open-heart surgery.” German energy customers have to pay roughly 25 billion euros  ($28 billion) in green energy surcharges a year to fund the expansion of wind and solar, drawing criticism from industry figures. Johannes Teyssen, chief executive of German energy firm E.ON, called on the government to cut the 25 billion euro bill that retail power clients and small enterprises have to pay each year for Germany’s renewable expansion. “Close the chapter on ill-fated green energy financing here and now. Take the surcharge burden off citizens and companies,” Teyssen said at the summit. Last week, Germany pledged 40 billion euros to pay for an early shutdown of coal-fired power generation. Altmaier defended a brand new exit plan for phasing out domestic brown coal mining and an exit from hard coal burning, both of which are expected to come by 2038 at the latest after environmentalists said Germany should abandon coal sooner. An exit from imported hard coal is being planned, which would aim to mostly stop using this energy source by the end of the decade. Altmaier said that a departure from coal could be accelerated, referring to arranged checks on the scheme in 2026 and 2029. Reiner Blaschek, who heads the German flat steel business of ArcelorMittal, the world’s top steelmaker, said the company was testing processes to cut carbon emissions at its blast furnaces in various European countries including France, Belgium and Germany. This entailed green hydrogen uses instead of traditional, natural-gas based processes, gas-capture, and using fermented bacteria to produce green ethanol, he said, adding there were still enormous challenges. It was clear that to turn heavy manufacturing electric, huge volumes of green power were needed, for example to feed them in electrolysis capacity to produce hydrogen as a primary energy input.

Germany to ensure coal exit doesn't undermine EU's CO2 trading system: draft,Jan 21 2020,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany wants to ensure that its plan to cancel emissions certificates issued for coal power stations that are due to be shuttered doesn’t undermine the EU’s emissions trading system, the government said in a draft law seen by Reuters on Tuesday. It plans to achieve this by making use of the EU’s Market Stability Reserve, a mechanism that went into effect last year with the aim to take back excess permits from the market.              The government proposal also stipulates that the German finance and economy ministries will work with at least two independent appraisers to determine how many certificates placed in the EU reserve should be cancelled. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government wants to shut all of Germany’s coal-fired power plants by 2038 at the latest as part of measures to help it achieve a target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to 55% of their 1990 level by 2030. The draft says Germany would inform the EU about the scale of permissions in the emission permits reserve it wishes to cancel in the calendar year after the power plants had been shut down. Germany will then issue fewer carbon certificates to ensure its coal exit doesn’t exacerbate a surplus of emissions permits that has built up in the EU, leading to lower carbon prices and weaker incentives to cut emissions. The draft also says that Germany will force the closure of power plants fired by hard coal starting in 2027 if utilities do not take up compensation tenders, a U-turn that appears to be designed to pressure utilities to accept compensation. The government said in a draft last year it would not force hard coal power plants to close over the next seven years and that it would use a mixture of subsidies and tenders to encourage operators to close polluting plants. The government proposal said tenders for compensation would be assessed between 2024 and 2026 and forced closures would ensue if utilities operating hard coal plants failed to apply.

"Global deal over digital tax eludes France, U.S. in Davos talks",Jan 23 2020,"DAVOS (Reuters) - France and the United States failed on Wednesday to agree how to push forward a global rewrite of decades-old cross-border tax rules though they agreed to set aside a bilateral row on digital taxation, France’s finance minister said on Wednesday. Governments from nearly 140 countries aim to give their backing to pursue what would be the biggest overhaul of international tax rules since the 1920s at the end of the month at the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. But preparations led in part by France and the United States have been eclipsed by a bilateral dispute between the two with Washington threatening retaliatory tariffs against Paris’ own national tax on big tech companies that book out-sized profits on French income despite minimal physical presence. The United States has further complicated the backdrop for a global deal by proposing last month that the future rules should be optional for companies. Calling a truce until the end of the year, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he had agreed with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Davos that France would not require companies to pay its digital tax this year and that Mnuchin had agreed to suspend the tariff threat in the mean time. Le Maire added: “The U.S. and France committed themselves to work on a global international solution on digital taxation and international taxation.” “But we still need to have a clear understanding of what will be the working basis at the OECD and we want this basis to be solid, credible and fair.” He said that the future tax rules could not be credible if they were optional for companies and said he would meet again with Mnuchin on Thursday to discuss the issue.

Greece expects tourism growth this year despite bumpy 2019: minister,Jan 23 2020,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Tourism, which accounts for about a quarter of Greece’s gross domestic product, will grow in 2020 despite the blow dealt to the sector last year by the collapse of British travel giant Thomas Cook, Tourism Minister Harry Theocharis said on Thursday.    Greece is emerging from a decade-long debt crisis and relying on its resorts, beaches and ancient monuments to attract strong visitor numbers if it is to fully recover. Tourism  employs roughly one in five people. Revenues in 2019 grew an estimated 12-15 % from about 16 billion euros in 2018 on the back of a 4% to 5% rise in arrivals, Theocharis told Reuters in an interview. About 33 million tourists visited Greece in 2018, the year the country exited its third international bailout.  The collapse of Thomas Cook in September left thousands of holidaymakers stranded at island resorts and dealt a significant blow to Greek hoteliers and businesses. The impact was initially estimated at 500 million euros  ($555 million) and was seen spilling over to 2020, an immediate worry for the conservative government that took office in July.  But the sector has found new contracts and replaced the lost slots, Theocharis said, adding, “Despite the ups and downs, the surprises and the hurdles, 2019 rewarded us with a positive result”. “We are in a position to envision a new year with optimism that Thomas Cook has not left its mark,” he said. “We expect 2020 will be better than 2019.” Greece’s target for 2020 and the years to come is an annual one-digit rise in arrivals and a two-digit increase in revenue, said Theocharis, who headed revenue collection at the country’s finance ministry at the peak of the crisis in 2013-14.  The government has been mulling changes to the sector ranging from further regulating the homesharing market to opening up the industry to sea diving tourism, which is currently restricted because of the many archaeological ruins in Greek waters. The sector is still vulnerable to risks outside the government’s control such as a recession in Europe or turmoil in the Middle East, Theocharis said. Climate change is a long-term challenge, he said, and Greece is studying its estimated impact. “Greece has a strong brand and can win a big share of the market as long as economic and other conditions allow it.”  ","{'neg': 0.098, 'neu': 0.81, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': -0.5859}",-0.5859
Hungarian banks renew call for tax easing as instant payment launch nears,Jan 22 2020,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian banks say they have spent up to $133 million on a new instant-payments system and won’t pass on the cost to customers, but are seeking to recoup part of it by asking the government to ease a financial transaction tax. Under the new system, due to launch on March 2 after several months of delays, domestic bank transfers worth up to 10 million forints ($33,050) will be settled within five seconds, seven days a week, as the banks respond to increased competition from fintech providers. Andras Becsei, chairman of the Hungarian Banking Association, said the project - at a total cost of 30-40 billion forints - was the biggest investment the lenders had ever made. “To make instant payments a success, it is important for local lenders not to be at a competitive disadvantage to foreign service providers,” he said, reiterating the banks’ call for a tax on financial transactions to be repealed. Levente Kovacs, secretary general of the association, said banks had struck a gentlemen’s agreement with the central bank that customers would not face increased charges to cover the cost of the new system.  But the association - including OTP Bank OTPB.BU and foreign players such as Austria’s Raiffeisen (), Belgium’s KBC Groep () and Italy’s UniCredit () - said the government should reduce the annual tax by 10 billion forints ($33 million) to take account of their extra costs. The financial transaction tax is expected to raise 226 billion forints this year. The finance ministry did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.   The association said the sector’s net profit rose by 10% to 560 billion forints in the first nine months of 2019 as lending expanded by 20%.

Mexico goes ghost as its oil hedge bill spirals,Jan 23 2020,"MEXICO CITY/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mexico is playing a risky game of hide and seek with the oil market. To frustrate speculators and contain an annual bill of more than $1 billion, Mexico is going to new lengths to mask its attempts to insure its revenue from oil sales against falling prices - no mean feat for a hedging program known as Wall Street’s biggest oil trade.  Getting the hedge right is crucial for Mexico as it offers stability at a time the government is planning to boost social welfare and security spending, the economy is stagnating and the country’s credit-worthiness is under intense scrutiny. Once an enigmatic agreement between a handful of finance industry officials and Wall Street banks, the hedge is now the most anticipated deal in the oil futures market, making it harder, and more costly, for Mexico to arrange. For its 2020 hedge, however, Mexico has adopted a different strategy than in previous years, according to a Wall Street source with direct knowledge of the deal. This time, an estimated two-thirds of the options Mexico bought in financial markets were indexed to the international Brent crude benchmark, shifting away from the Maya oil Mexico mainly produces, according to the source. By using such a heavily traded contract as Brent, Mexico should have been able to cut costs by getting lower quotes for its trades and to place bets more unobtrusively to avoid prices shifting ahead of its moves, market sources said.     But critics say the strategy creates new risks. By using international oil contracts based on a different kind of oil, the structure of the hedge may not fully reflect Mexico’s export mix dominated by Maya, which is typically cheaper than Brent. “I would expect a divergence of prices over the long term. This pressure on Maya could move prices down faster than its hedge. This would cause a loss on the physical sale of Maya and minimal-to-possibly no benefit of the hedge,” said Ryan Dusek, director at consulting firm Opportune LLP https://opportune.com based in Houston, who added that the trade could end up being “worthless.” The Mexican finance ministry declined to comment on the structure of the hedge. The Wall Street source said the proportion of Maya crude hedged for 2020 was significantly lower than in previous years.  For the 2009 deal, for example, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley hedged 305 million barrels of crude using Maya and only 25 million with Brent, data obtained by Reuters through a freedom of information request showed. The Wall Street source said for 2020, Mexico had bought put options on Brent on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) at $54-$56 a barrel and hedged Maya at $42.  Brent LCOc1 is trading at around $63 a barrel while Maya’s official selling price for deliveries to the U.S. Gulf Coast is about $55, according to S&P Global Platts pricing data. The options give Mexico the right to sell oil at the predetermined price, so if the actual market price is lower, the options pay out and make up the difference - acting effectively as an insurance policy. But if the price of Maya, a heavy sour crude, falls faster than Brent, a light sweet crude - or Maya drops and Brent rises - Mexico could miss out on oil revenues without the hedge kicking in, analysts and market sources said. Mexico has had to contend with the potential divergence in Maya and Brent crude prices before but the risk is now greater as demand for heavy crudes globally is expected to slump. Reuters was unable to determine whether Mexico has taken additional steps to bridge any gaps between Maya and Brent. Mere rumors of Mexico’s “Hacienda hedge,” which gets its name from the country’s finance ministry, can shift prices ahead of its anticipated deals and the government fears participants push up premiums when they suspect Mexico is about to trade. “Banks have become much better at accumulating information about it,” said Victor Gomez, a former Mexican finance ministry official involved in the hedge until 2018. In part due to this, the hedge’s cost has increased 10-fold in peso terms since 2001, even though the number of barrels hedged has barely changed, the data obtained from the freedom of information request showed. Mexico spent the equivalent of $212 million to hedge 200 million barrels in 2001 but in 2016, hedging 212 million barrels cost $956 million. In 2017, Mexico stopped disclosing the number of barrels it has hedged.  Now, for the first time in at least 19 years, finance ministry officials have declined to reveal how much they’re spending to protect 2020 revenue, saying the information would give speculators insight into their strategy and raise costs. “What we don’t want is that they identify the moments that Mexico goes to the market, because that raises the costs of the premium,” Gabriel Yorio, one of the main architects of the hedge under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office a year ago, told reporters this month. The cost of the hedge has also risen because the peso has declined versus the U.S. dollar and because options have become more expensive since many commodity-oriented funds, which were natural counterparties to the deal, have closed. Officials have also declined to say how much of the 1.73 million barrels a day it produces they’re protecting, nor to what extent they’re using put options or a budget stabilization fund to guarantee government revenue. All they have disclosed is that the 2020 hedge guarantees an average price for Maya of $49 a barrel. (Graphic: Mexico oil hedge - ) Since 2001, Mexico has received three payouts up until the end of last year: in 2009, 2015 and 2016, the data showed. Nevertheless, those three payments were so large the finance ministry could argue it was still ahead - at least before including the cost of the 2020 program. Mexico has also taken other steps to cover its tracks. In response to further questions in Reuters’ records request, Mexico’s transparency institute said additional information about the hedge had been sealed for five years. It cited the finance ministry as saying revealing details could increase costs, affect Mexico’s monetary policy and financial stability and create systemic financial risk. “This is part of Mexico’s strategy to leave banks and oil majors in the dark about what they are buying and how much they are paying,” said Gomez. Asked about specifics at a news conference on Jan. 9, Mexican official Yorio highlighted the importance of the overhaul of the crude oil pricing formulas that underpin Mexico’s oil exports. Last year, Mexico changed the pricing formula for Maya sales to the U.S. Gulf Coast to be based 65% on U.S. West Texas Intermediate in Houston - a light sweet crude which is the most traded U.S. Gulf Coast grade - and 35% on Brent futures. Before, it had been derived from West Texas Sour, Dated Brent and other grades that have become less traded markets. The formula also previously included fuel oil rich in sulphur, which has been hit by new rules requiring ships to use cleaner fuel. Mexican officials involved in the hedge in the past said the government may be considering increasing its use of the stabilization fund to guarantee oil prices as a supplement to financial instruments. From the mid-2010s, Mexico started to lock in part of its target oil price with the fund to contain the costs of the options it buys from banks and major oil companies. For example, Mexico locked in a price of $79 for its 2015 hedge, with $76.40 guaranteed by options and the remaining $2.60 backed by the fund. In 2017, the last time the ministry released such information, $4 of its $42 hedge was covered by the fund.  Gomez and Julio Ruiz, another former official involved in the hedge until 2018, said Mexico was expected to expand this strategy in the coming years but cautioned it would struggle to keep enough money in the fund to hedge oil exports fully.  “They would have to accumulate a larger amount of resources in this fund,” Gomez said. Nevertheless, those changes would do little to ease the concerns of some who believe Mexico spends too much on the hedge, said Ruiz, adding that guaranteeing oil revenue was still necessary given the pressures on Mexico and state-owned Pemex, the world’s most heavily indebted oil company. “In congress, many will say they don’t agree with how this money is spent, and that it shouldn’t be spent on the oil hedging program,” Ruiz said.  “But Mexico’s finances would become a lot more volatile without it.” ","{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.894, 'pos': 0.052, 'compound': 0.2154}",0.2154
Incoming Bank of England chief to face questions over investment firm collapse,Jan 23 2020,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England governor-designate Andrew Bailey will be interviewed about his supervision of collapsed investment firm London Capital & Finance as head of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), an independent inquiry said on Thursday. LCF collapsed in January 2019, leaving 11,600 bondholders nursing losses of up to 237 million pounds  ($312 million). It was selling “mini-bonds” that raise cash for small firms.  The bonds were not regulated by the FCA, which Bailey heads, but LCF itself and marketing material were. Elizabeth Gloster, a barrister selected to head the inquiry, said the process of gathering documents for her investigation was nearing completion and the next stage was to interview officials at the FCA. Gloster told a meeting of over 100 bondholders that Bailey has been chief executive of the watchdog for almost all of the period that LCF was authorised. Bailey is due to take up his new post as governor of the Bank of England in March. Bailey has already assured her he will be available, Gloster added, declining to say when the interview would take place. Her report is due to be delivered in July.   The FCA will be required to set out key findings, lessons learned and any actions being taken, she added. The FCA declined to comment.  Britain’s Serious Fraud Office is also investigating the collapse of LCF. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme said this month it planned to compensate only 159 bondholders who the body believed ‘were given misleading advice by LCF’.  Gloster said her remit does not cover whether bondholders should be compensated but her conclusions will inform the  government about whether compensation should be paid. “I am personally very conscious of the huge personal and financial impact on many of the LCF investors as a result of the collapse,” Gloster said. “We received very sad letters and emails from a very large number of bondholders, some of which make very distressing reading.”  ","{'neg': 0.083, 'neu': 0.89, 'pos': 0.027, 'compound': -0.9629}",-0.9629
India likely to fund some $28 billion of 2020/21 expenditure via off-budget borrowings: sources,Jan 23 2020,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is likely to fund roughly $28 billion of its expenditure outlay in its budget for fiscal 2020/21 via off-budget borrowings, three government sources said, as it seeks to revive a sagging economy while keeping its fiscal deficit in check. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is under pressure to increase spending on rural welfare schemes and infrastructure to boost growth that has fallen for six straight quarters.  Off-budget borrowings are a means by which the government keeps its fiscal deficit in check by making quasi-government entities borrow on its behalf, to partly fund its expenditure plan for the year. This would mark a roughly 13.8% increase in so-called off-budget borrowings from an estimated 1.75 trillion rupees ($24.6 billion) in the ongoing fiscal year, said the three sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter and asked not to be identified as the discussions are private.  “We’re facing a serious economic crisis,” said one of the sources, adding there was no alternative but to raise spending on infrastructure and welfare schemes to boost consumer demand and create jobs. “You should not be surprised if the real deficit touches 4.5% of GDP,” he said, adding the “official” deficit could be kept between 3.5% and 4% of GDP.  He said the government had realized it needed to take all possible steps to support growth “after initial denial of the economic slowdown”.  A spokesman for the finance ministry declined to comment, citing the silent period ahead of the budget speech on Feb. 1. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) this month cut India’s growth forecast to 4.8% for the ongoing fiscal year - its lowest level in 11 years. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who will deliver the budget speech, is widely expected to announce stimulus measures for small businesses and non-banking finance companies as a cut in corporate tax rates and rate cuts by the central bank have failed to revive growth. The fiscal deficit for the current fiscal year was likely to touch 3.7% or 3.8% of GDP after the slowdown dented revenue collections, the second government official said.  In the 2020/21 budget, Sitharaman could announce plans to spend over 105 trillion rupees ($1.48 trillion) on infrastructure in the next five years and expand annual spending on railways, roads, renewable energy, water and health sector by up to 20%, said the first official.    “Inflation is not an issue for now,” he said, adding that India needed 5-6% inflation to improve agricultural and corporate earnings.  The government could increase the target of raising revenue through privatization of state companies to 1.5 trillion rupees for next fiscal year, the second official said.  India’s committed spending, excluding capital spending, could be targeted at near 27 trillion rupees ($379.91 billion) for the next fiscal year, compared to the budgeted 24.5 trillion rupees in the current fiscal year, while about 4 trillion rupees could be allocated to capital spending, the first official said.  Modi’s party has also urged him to announce steps to revive real estate and other sectors. “We are no more in a denial mode,” Gopal Krishan Agarwal, the head of BJP’s Economic Affairs Cell, told Reuters. “You will see measures in the budget to boost investments and growth.” ","{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.826, 'pos': 0.101, 'compound': 0.9477}",0.9477
"Indian shares rebound after sharp fall, banks gain",Jan 23 2020,"BENGALURU, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Indian shares rebounded on Thursday after a sharp pullback this week, driven by bargain-hunting and well-received earnings reports from Axis Bank and Larsen & Toubro (L&T). The NSE Nifty 50 index, which has slid 2% this week amid concerns over economic growth and poor corporate earnings, was up 0.49% at 12,165.50 by 0429 GMT. The S&P BSE Sensex was higher by 0.56% at 41,345.25. Meanwhile, other Asian markets wilted as investors fretted over the spread of a new flu-like virus in China just as millions prepared to travel for the Lunar New Year. Banking shares led the rebound in Indian markets. The Nifty banking index, down 2.81% this week through Wednesday, was higher by 0.64%, while the Nifty PSU bank index that tracks state-run lenders rose 1.07%. “There is value-buying at lower levels due to the recent correction,” said A.K. Prabhakar, head of research at IDBI Capital in Mumbai. “A few stocks have corrected more than the market, and they offer attractive entry points.” Poorly received earnings from top Indian companies this week dented risk appetite, but investors took heart from Axis Bank’s better-than-expected net interest margins and construction firm L&T sticking to its revenue growth outlook despite macroeconmic challenges. Axis Bank was up 2.9%, while L&T rose 2.6%. Both stocks were among the top gainers on the Nifty 50. The government’s move last year to cut corporate taxes is also helping companies report healthier profits. But some economists say those actions may not be enough to stimulate growth, particularly as inflation touched a 40-month high in November. Analysts have said Indian markets will likely remain volatile until the government presents the federal budget on Feb. 1, when it may also unveil more measures to lift growth. Meanwhile, shares in bankrupt Dewan Housing Finance Corp Ltd , once one of the country’s largest shadow banks, were down about 1% after the company reported a 67-billion rupee ($943 million) loss for the September quarter.

Italian PM Conte pulls out of Davos trip amid political turmoil,Jan 23 2020,"ROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte canceled a planned trip to the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos on Thursday, a day after the head of the co-governing 5 Star Movement resigned, piling pressure on his divided coalition. The prime minister’s office gave no detailed reason for the cancellation of the trip but said Conte would be remaining in Rome to work on “urgent issues”. Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, who has been in government since the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement won 33% of the national vote in the 2018 election, quit on Wednesday following a wave of defections that had threatened the stability of the government. His resignation had added to growing political uncertainty in Italy ahead of local elections at the weekend where the right-wing opposition League party is hoping for big gains to add weight to its demands for new national elections. Italian government bonds have remained steady and on Thursday, Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri said the ruling coalition remained strongly committed to government stability and that the 5-Star Movement had assured its support. “The party’s already said it was committed to the stability of the government. So nothing will change,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. Di Maio, who remains in office as foreign minister, has been replaced as caretaker by the head of 5-Star’s internal rules committee Vito Crimi, until a permanent successor is chosen at a party conference in the next few months. The party has been hit by a series of high profile defections from its parliamentary party, losing more than 30 lawmakers since 2018, amid deep disagreements on policies including its partnership with the centre-left Democratic Party.

"Italy readies pension reform, may end early retirement scheme ahead of schedule",Jan 23 2020,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy is preparing to reform its pension system again to make it more flexible for those who want to leave work early, officials say, and the changes may include ending ahead of time a costly but underused 2018 plan that lowered the minimum retirement age. With a steadily growing army of retirees, pensions in Italy are a national obsession and one of the most frequently debated topics on television talk shows. Under the 2018 “quota 100” plan, people can draw a pension if they have paid in 38 years of contributions as long as they are 62 years old - the sum of the two figures giving the “100” of the plan’s name. The plan was budgeted to cost almost 20 billion euros ($22.2 billion) over three years until 2021, when it is due to expire. But some in the government are pushing to drop it at the end of this year to save money. With one of the world’s oldest populations, Italy spends more than 16% of national output on pensions, more than any other developed country except Greece, data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development shows.  This makes it harder for Rome to reduce its debt, which is the second highest in the European Union and drains resources from other areas. For example, Italy is near the bottom of the OECD’s 35-nation league table for education spending. “Instead of waiting for the natural end of quota 100 at the end of 2021, it would be better to have a replacement solution ready to come into force next January,” Treasury undersecretary Pier Paolo Baretta of the ruling Democratic Party told Reuters. As things stand, when quota 100 expires, retirement rules are set to automatically revert to those imposed in a highly unpopular 2011 reform that raised the retirement age to 67. The government wants to avoid this by introducing a new system that is less generous than quota 100 but less severe than the 2011 regime, imposed by former premier Mario Monti at the height of the euro zone debt crisis. One option being considered is to let people retire at 64 but on a reduced pension compared with what they would get if they stayed at work a few years longer, said a government source who asked not to be named. “Pension reform is one of our top priorities,” said Labour Minister Nunzia Catalfo of the co-ruling 5-Star Movement. “We will try to find a way to help workers retire earlier, especially those with physically tough jobs,” she told Reuters. The new reform will be the sixth significant overhaul in recent decades. Three of the previous ones raised the retirement age, while two of them, including quota 100, reduced it. Ending quota 100 a year early would yield significant savings, but the new system will be more expensive than going back to the 2011 reform. The quota 100 option has proved less popular than expected, which has helped public finances. Pasquale Tridico, head of the state pensions agency INPS, told Reuters he estimated savings of 2.6 billion euros in 2020 and at least 2 billion in 2021. Most of this money has already been earmarked for other spending measures in the budget passed by parliament last month, a Treasury official said. Successive governments have tinkered with the system ever since the mid-1990s, when a hugely generous pension regime still allowed millions of people to retire in their 40s and 50s under what were known as “baby pensions.” Those are a thing of the past, but Italian pensioners have still fared better than workers during two decades of economic stagnation. Average pensions grew twice as much as wages between 2000 and 2015, data from national statistics bureau ISTAT shows. ","{'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.859, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': 0.9834}",0.9834

Lebanon forms government with backing of Hezbollah and allies,Jan 21 2020,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon formed a new government on Tuesday under Prime Minister Hassan Diab after the Shi’ite group Hezbollah and its allies agreed on a cabinet that must urgently address an economic crisis.        The heavily indebted state has been without effective government since Saad al-Hariri quit as premier in October, prompted by protests against politicians who have collectively led Lebanon into the worst crisis since the 1975-90 war. New Finance Minister Ghazi Wazni said Lebanon needed foreign aid to save it from an unprecedented situation that had forced people to “beg for dollars” at the banks and fear for their deposits. He also described forthcoming foreign currency sovereign debt maturities as “a fireball”. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah and allies including President Michel Aoun nominated Diab as premier last month after efforts failed to strike a deal with Hariri, Lebanon’s main Sunni leader and a traditional ally of the West and Gulf Arab states. Weeks of wrangling over portfolios among Hezbollah’s allies held up an agreement until Tuesday, when the heavily armed group delivered an ultimatum to its allies to make a deal or suffer the consequences, sources familiar with the talks said. The cabinet is made up of 20 specialist ministers backed by parties. Wazni, an economist who had served as an adviser to parliament’s finance and budget committee, was nominated with the backing of Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. Nassif Hitti, a former ambassador to the Arab League, was named foreign minister with the backing of Aoun’s Free Patriotic Movement. Diab described his government as a technocratic “rescue team” that would work to achieve protesters’ goals. His first trip abroad would be to the Arab region, particularly the Gulf. But analysts said Hezbollah’s role meant Diab might have trouble winning foreign support. Protesters took to the streets of Beirut as the government was announced. Police fired water canons at stone-throwing demonstrators near parliament who tried to dismantle newly erected barricades. “This government doesn’t reflect us,” said protester Rabih Al-Zein.  The absence of a government had left Lebanon rudderless as ordinary people suffered in the crisis. A liquidity crunch has led banks to restrict access to cash and the Lebanese pound to slump. Jobs have been lost and inflation has soared. Over the last week, hundreds have been injured in clashes between the security forces and demonstrators. Hezbollah is designated as a terrorist group by the United States, and Sunni-led Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Arab states that have provided Lebanon with financial aid in the past have for years been deeply concerned by its rising influence in Beirut.     “It will certainly not be easy for a government of this type to convince the outside world to help Lebanon,” said Nabil Boumonsef, deputy editor-in-chief of the An-Nahar newspaper.     Hariri and his Future Movement have stayed out of the government, along with the staunchly anti-Hezbollah Christian Lebanese Forces party and the Progressive Socialist Party of Druze leader Walid Jumblatt. “Any government is better than a vacuum because what is coming is more difficult,” Jumblatt wrote on Twitter. Mohanad Hage Ali, a fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, said the new government of “one color” could further polarize Lebanese politics. Hariri’s absence meant that old Sunni-Shi’ite tensions might be reactivated. One of the government’s first tasks will be to decide its approach to looming sovereign bond repayments, including a $1.2 billion Eurobond maturing in March. Wazni, speaking to al-Jadeed TV, said the government needed “a clear position” on the maturing Eurobonds.  Lebanon’s union of exchange dealers said on Tuesday it had decided to set the exchange rate at a maximum of 2,000 Lebanese pounds to the U.S. dollar in agreement with the central bank governor. The pound has been officially pegged at 1,507.50 to the dollar for more than two decades. Diab expressed hope that the currency would strengthen.

"Lebanon should restructure Eurobonds, seek IMF help: ex-minister",Jan 22 2020,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon should restructure its Eurobonds, including a $1.2 billion issue maturing in March, and secure a multi-billion dollar IMF bailout to stave off economic meltdown, its former labor minister said. The country is deep in financial crisis and struggling with one of the world’s largest debt piles relative to GDP, and markets are focused on whether a new government formed on Tuesday will meet the March payment. “I don’t see the logic of the system leaking $500 to $600 million out of Lebanon on the March payment when an actual restructuring of the Eurobonds is next to inevitable,” Camille Abousleiman told Reuters in an interview. “That money would be better spent on other things, such as food and medicine.”  Abousleiman, who drafted the legal framework for Lebanon’s bonds from the mid-1990s onwards, spoke on Tuesday while still caretaker labor minister. He is not part of the new government. Lebanon has never defaulted on its international debt but with its longer-dated bonds trading at less than half their face value, the market is already pricing in prospects of a default or restructuring.  The central bank mulled a proposal to ask local holders of some of this year’s bonds to swap them for longer-dated ones to ease pressure on state finances. Former caretaker finance minister Ali Hassan Khalil asked it to hold off on that plan until the new government was formed.  “The size of the debt is too large relative to the size of the economy,” said Abousleiman, who said any restructuring of the debt could include an extension of the maturity or reduction in the interest rate, not necessarily the principal. Lebanon’s gross public debt is around $89.5 billion, 38% of it in foreign currency.  Finance Minister Ghazi Wazni on Tuesday said the new government must decide on its approach to the Eurobond due in March and also needed foreign support to help ease economic and financial strains. Abousleiman said it was “inevitable” the new government would look to secure IMF support as there was no other way to get the “large liquidity” Lebanon needed. A deal of around $4 billion to $5 billion might ease the deficit, reassure bondholders and encourage other prospective international donors, while also giving momentum to economic and social reforms, he said. “This needs to be accompanied by a serious plan to combat corruption and return ill-gotten gains,” he said, referencing one of the root causes of widespread civil unrest.

"Lebanon to seek up to $5bln in soft loans, prime minister rallies support",Jan 23 2020,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon’s new government must reassure international donors it is serious about reforms to tackle a financial crisis as it looks initially to secure up to $5 billion in soft loans for basic goods, its finance minister said on Thursday. The government that took office on Tuesday faces an emergency in which banks have imposed controls, the Lebanese pound has weakened and protesters have turned to violence which a senior U.N. official described as “politically manipulated”. “The entire international community has its eye on what this government will do,” Finance Minister Ghazi Wazni said in televised comments. “What is its programme, what are the reform steps, is it ready for support or no?” Lebanon is looking to secure $4 billion to $5 billion in soft loans from international donors to finance purchases of wheat, fuel and medicines, The Daily Star newspaper had earlier quoted the minister as saying.  “This injection will cover the country’s needs for one year,” said Wazni. Bank restrictions on access to cash, inflation and job losses have hit people hard. Increasingly violent though more limited protests have replaced jubilant demonstrations against a political elite blamed for driving Lebanon towards collapse. Interior minister Mohammed Fahmi said the state would not tolerate attacks on security forces who he said would protect people’s rights, including freedom of expression. On Wednesday, protesters broke stone slabs off buildings in a luxury commercial district of Beirut to hurl at barricades guarded by security forces blocking paths to parliament.  “This looks more like a political manipulation to provoke the security forces, to undermine civil peace, to fan up sectarian strife,” Jan Kubis, U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon, wrote on Twitter, mentioning attacks on security forces and vandalism of state institutions and private property. The new government was set up with backing from the powerful Iran-backed group Hezbollah and its political allies. Major political parties that have Western backing, including that of former premier Saad al-Hariri, are not part of the cabinet. Analysts say the influence of Hezbollah over the cabinet may complicate its attempt to secure foreign funding, particularly from Gulf Arab states that have provided aid in the past but see Hezbollah as a threat. Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc urged the government to hasten its rescue programme. The cabinet has formed a committee to draft a policy statement to be presented to parliament. Prime Minister Hassan Diab met several foreign ambassadors as the heavily indebted government looks to rally support. It must decide how to deal with maturing Eurobonds, including a $1.2 billion bond due in March. Diab’s office said British Ambassador Chris Rampling conveyed Britain’s readiness to support Lebanon but that the government “must show its commitment to reform that Lebanon needs urgently”. The European Union’s ambassador to Lebanon, Ralph Tarraf, said he had agreed with Diab on the need for Lebanon to “focus on economic files, address the crisis and institute structural reforms”, two local media outlets reported. Foreign governments and institutions have demanded Lebanon enact long-delayed reforms to curb state waste and corruption before any new financial support is released. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday only a government “capable and committed to undertaking real and tangible reforms will restore investor confidence and unlock international assistance.” Lebanon won pledges exceeding $11 billion for a programme of infrastructure investment at a 2018 international conference, conditional on such reforms.

Macron and Trump declare truce in digital tax dispute,Jan 21 2020,"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday he had a “great discussion” with U.S. President Donald Trump over a digital tax planned by Paris and said the two countries would work together to avoid a rise in tariffs. The two leaders agreed to the truce after Paris offered to suspend down payments for this year’s digital tax and Washington promised to keep negotiating toward a solution rather than acting on a tariff threat, French sources said.  Specifically, Macron and Trump agreed to hold off on a potential tariff war until the end of 2020, a French diplomatic source said, and to push ahead with broader negotiations at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to rewrite the rules of international taxation during that period. “They agreed to give a chance to negotiations until the end of the year,” the source said. “During that time period, there won’t be successive tariffs.” France decided in July to apply a 3% levy on revenue from digital services earned in France by companies with revenues of more than 25 million euros ($28 million) in France and 750 million euros worldwide.  Washington threatened to impose trade tariffs on French Champagne, handbags and other goods in response. It complained the tax unfairly targeted U.S. internet companies, a claim Paris dismissed. French authorities have repeatedly said any international agreement on digital taxation reached within the OECD would immediately supersede the French tax. But concerned that the United States would snub the OECD negotiations and proceed with tariffs on French goods, France has offered to suspend until the end of the year down payments on its digital tax that would have been due in April. “What we’re proposing is to give ourselves time and to show our goodwill, to postpone the remaining payments to December,” a French Finance Ministry source said. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are due to negotiate the details in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, the source added. The White House said on Monday both Trump and Macron agreed it was important to complete the negotiations successfully. Nearly 140 countries are to meet at the OECD at the end of the month to give their backing for the biggest rewrite of international tax rules since the 1920s, to bring them up to date for the digital era.

"UPDATE 2-Malaysia's c.bank cuts rates in surprise move, warns risks remain",Jan 22 2020,"* Malaysia’s c.bank makes surprise 25 bps cut * C.bank says rate cut ‘pre-emptive measure’ to improve growth * Cut likely one-and-done for the year - UOB (Adds more details, analyst comments) By Joseph Sipalan KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Malaysia’s central bank surprised markets by cutting its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, calling it a pre-emptive move to ensure the country’s improving growth trend continues. Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) said it expects growth to gradually improve with support from private spending, better external demand and a modest recovery in overall investment activity but warned downside risks to growth remained. “These include uncertainty from various trade negotiations, geopolitical risks, weaker-than-expected growth of major trade partners, heightened volatility in financial markets, and domestic factors that include weakness in commodity-related sectors and delays in the implementation of projects,” it said in a statement. The central bank cut its overnight policy rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 2.75%, the lowest since March 2011. Nearly all economists in a Reuters poll had expected BNM to keep the rate unchanged. The central bank last cut its policy rate in May by 25 basis points, in a bid to boost growth amid concerns over flagging global demand. Julia Goh, a Malaysia-based economist with UOB Bank, said the rate cut was earlier than expected, but will help extend the stimulus effects from the May cut and provide more support for growth over the rest of the year. “It’s probably one-and-done for now. Going forward, whether they would consider another rate cut really depends on the growth outlook and whether any risks start to emerge,” Goh said. Exports in November fell for a fourth month, contracting 5.5% from a year earlier, and recent palm oil curbs by India in retaliation against Malaysia’s Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad’s criticism of Indian domestic policies, could maintain the downward pressure on shipments. However, the government expects thawing trade tensions between the United States and China to aid growth for export-reliant Malaysia. “Any improvement in global trade volume will increase demand for Malaysian exports, and directly boost Malaysian GDP growth,” Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said in a separate statement on Wednesday. Lim maintained the government’s forecast of 4.8% growth in 2020, a slight uptick from the 4.7% pace it expects to set for the previous year.

McDermott to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection,Jan 21 2020,"(Reuters) - U.S. oilfield services provider McDermott International Inc MDR.N said on Tuesday it would file for prepackaged bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, as it looks to cut debt that ballooned following a major acquisition in 2018. The restructuring will be financed by a debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing of $2.81 billion, the company said. As part of the deal, McDermott has also entered a stalking-horse agreement to sell its Lummus Technology unit for $2.73 billion. DIP financing packages allow bankrupt companies to remain in business and fund operations as bankruptcy case proceeds. Texas-based McDermott’s total debt stood at $9.86 billion as of Nov. 4, 2019. “As a result of the transaction, we are eliminating over $4.6 billion in debt from our balance sheet and we will emerge with robust liquidity and significant financing to execute on customer projects in our backlog,” Chief Executive Officer of McDermott David Dickson said in a note.  McDermott’s shares were down 15% in premarket trade. Bloomberg reported on Friday the company was preparing to file for bankruptcy.. McDermott has been reeling under heavy debt since it combined its offshore engineering and construction business with Chicago Bridge & Iron Co (CB&I) in an all-stock deal valued at around $6 billion including nearly $4 billion in debt. The company’s total liabilities jumped to $7.86 billion at the end of June 2018 after it acquired CB&I, from $1.36 billion in the previous quarter. McDermott last year raised another $1.7 billion to support its operations and concurrently withdrew its full-year forecast.

"Michigan, Tesla settle suit over direct vehicle sales",Jan 23 2020,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla Inc and the state of Michigan confirmed Wednesday they have resolved the company’s 2016 lawsuit challenging the state’s refusal to allow the company to sell vehicles directly to consumers. The Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office said a resolution filed in U.S. District Court recognizes “that any Michigan resident may lawfully buy a Tesla and have it serviced in Michigan.” The stipulation also says Tesla may “operate under existing Michigan law; sell cars to Michigan customers as long as the sales contract indicates the sale took place in a state other than Michigan; and, indirectly own service and repair facilities in Michigan through a subsidiary, Tesla Michigan.” Reuters and other outlets reported the expected settlement on Tuesday. Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not sell its vehicles through a network of independent dealers. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk reacted to the settlement on Twitter writing: “Yay!” Tesla has filed a number of legal challenges over the years to state laws that prohibit or heavily restrict the ability of automakers to sell vehicles directly to consumers. The stipulation says Tesla may operate galleries in Michigan to “educate customers and facilitate transactions out-of-state.” Tesla may conduct demonstration drives, discuss prices, service, financing, leasing, and trade-ins with potential customers and facilitate “ordering and purchase of a vehicle for which legal title transfers out-of-state.” Tesla agreed to drop its suit and Michigan officials agreed to “take no enforcement action against Tesla or any Tesla  subsidiary” as long as it abided by the terms of the court papers.

Midwest utility Evergy stands by business plan as Elliott challenges,Jan 22 2020,"BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. midwestern utility Evergy Inc () affirmed on Tuesday its faith in its business plan after activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp urged the firm to improve its performance or consider a merger with another power company. Shares in Kansas City, Missouri-headquartered Evergy earlier hit a lifetime high after Elliott disclosed its demands and that it had an economic interest of 11.3 million shares - making it Evergy’s fourth-largest shareholder, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The stock closed 2% higher, giving the company a market cap of around $15.7 billion. Elliott said in its statement that some $5 billion of value could be added to Evergy if the company stopped its share buyback program, cut operations and maintenance costs, and deployed more cash into developing its infrastructure network, including building more renewable power generation. Evergy got 40% of its power from coal-fired plants in 2018, with renewables contributing 25% of its generation mix, according to an Evergy presentation dated November 2019. Alternatively, the firm should merge itself with another utility that could improve Evergy’s performance, Elliott added. Acknowledging that it had been talking to Elliott since October, Evergy said in a separate statement that, while it was open to evaluating opportunities, “we are confident in our ability to deliver long-term growth and shareholder value creation through the execution of our strategic plan.” It added that its current plan offered the best returns within the regulatory framework it agreed with watchdogs in Kansas and Missouri when it became Evergy in 2018, following the merging of Great Plains Energy and Westar Energy. Evergy’s creation followed a two-year regulatory battle: first announced in 2016 as Great Plains buying Westar, the transaction was restructured as a merger-of-equals after the Kansas Corporation Commission objected to how a Great Plains purchase would impact the combined company’s finances and customer bills. In a note, Wells Fargo analysts said while Evergy was an attractive target, the previous merger experience made it cautious toward getting regulatory sign-off on a new deal.  Any opportunities to invest in modernization and more renewables were restricted by Evergy’s plan with regulators, the bank added. Activist investor Elliott has targeted a number of utilities in recent years: its last campaign focused on Sempra Energy (), with a settlement involving board seats and a review of Sempra’s assets between the California-based utility and Elliott agreed in September 2018. Elliott is also a creditor in the ongoing bankruptcy of California utility PG&E Corp (). ","{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.178, 'compound': 0.996}",0.996
"Most new housing designs in England are 'substandard', audit finds",Jan 21 2020,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Three quarters of new housing developments in England are so badly designed they should never have been built, according to an independent audit released on Tuesday. Britain has seen a building boom in recent years spurred by government policies designed to address a housing shortage that has pushed up prices and contributed to homelessness. The national audit, conducted by University College London (UCL), reviewed more than 140 housing developments built across England since 2007 and found one in five should have been refused planning permission. Another 54% should have had ‘significant improvements’ to their designs with flaws ranging from poor access to roads to lack of waste storage facilities, parking or high quality green spaces, the report said. “It’s really a national tragedy,” said the report’s author Matthew Carmona, a professor at UCL’s Bartlett School of Planning. “The pressure to build is in a sense absolutely right, we need more homes, but we need more homes of a good quality that people can thrive in and communities can grow in,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.   The number of new homes built in England topped 170,000 in the year to June, according to government data, an 11-year high, boosted by a ‘Help to Buy’ scheme that offers buyers of newly built homes a government equity loan.     The scheme, targeted at new-build properties, is designed to help buyers with a small deposit get access to mortgage financing.    Andrew Whitaker, planning director at the Home Builders Federation, a representative body, said the overwhelming majority of new home buyers were “happy with their new home and the wider environment around it”.     The UCL audit found poor communities were 10 times more likely to get badly designed homes - even when a better design was affordable. The quality of Britain’s social housing has been under intense scrutiny since a fire killed 71 people at London’s Grenfell Tower in 2017. An inquiry last year found that combustible material on the building’s exterior had contributed to the scale of the tragedy. Britain has experienced a shortage of social housing since the 1980s, when the government allowed tenants to buy their homes at rock-bottom prices without replacing the stock. Since then, years of underbuilding, rising rents and cuts to social-housing benefits have exacerbated the problem. “There is no excuse for shoddy design,” a spokeswoman for Britain’s ministry of housing told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by email. “We also expect developers to make sure new homes are well designed, and our new national design guide sets out how beautiful places can be achieved in practice, ensuring slap-dash proposals don’t get built.” ","{'neg': 0.103, 'neu': 0.821, 'pos': 0.076, 'compound': -0.923}",-0.923

UPDATE 2-New blow for Ted Baker as accounting scandal doubles in size,Jan 22 2020,"* Inventory overstatement now estimated at 58 mln stg * Prior estimate was 20-25 mln stg * Latest in a series of setbacks for the company * Shares fall as much as 10% (Adds shares, background, analyst comment) By Yadarisa Shabong Jan 22 (Reuters) - An accounting scandal at Ted Baker is more than twice as big as initially estimated, the British fashion retailer said on Wednesday, adding to a stream of bad news over the past year and sending its shares down as much as 10%. The company, known for suits, shirts and dresses with quirky details, said the value of stock on its balance sheet was overstated by 58 million pounds ($76 million) as at Jan. 26, 2019, more than double its preliminary estimate of up to 25 million pounds. Ted Baker, which has not revealed the reasons for the overstatement, said a review by business consultants Deloitte had largely been completed and it planned to update the market further at its preliminary results, expected in late March. The overstatement was disclosed in December, weeks after the company appointed Rachel Osborne as its new finance head. She was named acting chief executive officer later that month after the surprise exit of Lindsay Page. It is the latest in a string of setbacks in the last year, including profit warnings, a decision to suspend dividend payments, and management changes after misconduct allegations against founder and top shareholder Ray Kelvin, which he denies. Ted Baker shares have lost more than 80% of their value since December 2018, when the allegations about Kelvin’s habit of hugging colleagues were first made. At 0904 GMT, the shares were down 7.2% at 296 pence, off an earlier low of 286.4 pence. The accounting scandal comes as Britain’s store groups struggle with subdued consumer spending and a switch to more shopping online. Ted Baker reiterated there would be no cash impact from adjustments to the value of prior year inventories. The company in December appointed law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer to undertake an independent review of the overstatement  alongside Deloitte.

"No alternative to grounded Boeing 737 MAX, Aercap CEO says",Jan 23 2020,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - There is no alternative to the grounded 737 MAX and it would be “absolutely stupid” for Boeing () to launch a replacement before the next wave of technology a decade from now, the head of one of the world’s top aircraft lessors said on Wednesday. Aengus Kelly, chief executive of Aercap (), which has committed to a fleet of 100 MAX jets, told Reuters in an interview he had spoken to all of the biggest MAX operators in the world and said they still viewed it as a very good plane.  Kelly was speaking after Boeing on Tuesday warned of further delays in returning its grounded 737 MAX airliner to service, with the plane not likely to be cleared by U.S. regulators until the middle of the year. He said that some of his customers may cancel leases, but that the majority would not and some are keen to order more.  “For people to say this is the end of the MAX, that is absolutely incorrect. These people don’t have much insight,” Kelly said. He said, however, it was still impossible to say when the MAX might fly again. “We saw another delay from Boeing last night – I don’t think they know,” he said. “Is July the last delay? Who knows?” Asked if the MAX might be replaced in the coming years, a move that might undermine the jet’s value, Kelly said it would be absolutely stupid for Boeing to launch a replacement plane before technology allows an additional 15% reduction in fuel burn, something he believes will not happen before 2030.  Kelly said all of the main aviation banks were still willing to lend money against the MAX, but added if that changed, the plane’s valuation would be hit.  “Are the lessors and the banks willing to still finance the MAX and buy the MAX? The answer to that right now is yes. And if that is the case that puts a floor on the value of the aircraft,” he said. He acknowledged banks may insist on lower loan-to-value ratios on loans issued against the MAX than against rival Airbus planes.  Kelly said he would expect Boeing to compensate it if it is forced to take back leases and lease the plane to new airlines. Any costs due to the grounding or any fall in the planes value would also feed into talks on compensation, he said.  “We would expect Boeing shareholders to absorb that pain because its their fault not our shareholders,” he said.

He has also overseen the Russian oil industry’s tax reforms, needed to sustain oil production in the country, where oilfields are becoming increasingly depleted. Novak also played a leading role in securing closer bonds with OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and helped clinch the production cuts deal in 2016. The agreement, in its recent iteration, expires at the end of March and some market participants have been jittery over who will be in charge of the vast Russian oil sector at a time of uncertainties on the global market and rising tensions in the Middle East.

Pakistan defends Chinese investment after U.S. official's criticism,Jan 23 2020,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan on Thursday rejected criticism of the $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), after a visiting U.S. official was quoted expressing apprehension over the plan.  While Pakistan has continuously defended Chinese investment, it has also attempted to mend relations with the United States. Prime Minister Imran Khan and U.S. President Donald Trump have held at least three one-on-one meetings over the last six months, the latest on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday. U.S. officials have repeatedly criticized CPEC, under which Beijing has pledged about $60 billion for infrastructure in Pakistan, central to China’s wider Belt and Road initiative to develop land and sea trade routes in Asia and beyond. Washington says the project is not sufficiently transparent and will saddle Pakistan with the burden of expensive Chinese loans. Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported that Alice Wells, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, had made similar remarks at a closed-door think tank event in Pakistan on Tuesday. Asked about the U.S. official’s comments, Pakistan’s foreign office spokeswoman, Aisha Farooqui, said CPEC was a transformational project for Pakistan, and completing it was the  government’s highest priority. “To claim that CPEC is always in the form of loans and other forms of financing often non-concessional with sovereign guarantees is not based on facts,” Farooqui said during her weekly briefing. Before coming to power, Khan had also questioned the transparency of CPEC projects and expressed concern over Pakistan’s rising debt burden. Since winning the 2018 election, he has tended to avoid such remarks, although some ministers in his cabinet have spoken of the need to renegotiate some deals. The Chinese Embassy in Islamabad, in a statement on Wednesday, said: “The U.S. is obsessed with the story it [has] made for CPEC.”  “If the U.S. truly cares about the development and prosperity of Pakistan and this region, it should bring cash and funds, promote win-win cooperation on the basis of mutual respect, fairness and justice, rather than act as a world policeman, spreading rumors and provoking China-Pakistan relations.” ","{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.865, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': -0.25}",-0.25

Portugal investigates firms co-owned by dos Santos; Angola may seek arrest warrant,Jan 23 2020,"LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal’s market watchdog has launched inquiries into various firms where Angolan billionaire Isabel dos Santos holds stakes, after Angola’s chief prosecutor said she could face an international arrest warrant if she fails to cooperate in a fraud investigation. Angola has named dos Santos, the daughter of former President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, as a suspect over alleged mismanagement and misappropriation of funds while she was chairwoman of state oil firm Sonangol in 2016-2017.  In a statement sent to Reuters, Santos denied any wrongdoing and said she would “seek to clarify our position in relation to the latest accusations”. “I have always operated within the law and all my commercial transactions have been approved by lawyers, banks, auditors and regulators,” she said.  In Portugal, Angola’s former colonial power, dos Santos holds significant stakes in several important firms.  Gabriela Figueiredo Dias, the head of Portugal’s market regulator CMVM, said it had launched inquiries earlier this week into two of those companies, oil company Galp Energia and telecoms firm NOS, and into unspecified auditing firms. Galp declined to comment and a NOS spokesman said the company had no comment so far. Angola’s chief prosecutor was quoted by Portugal’s Lusa news agency as saying late on Wednesday, before traveling to Lisbon on Thursday, that his office sought dos Santos and other suspects “to voluntarily come to face justice”. Failing that, his office would resort to legal instruments at its disposal, one being an international warrant. Portuguese newspaper Expresso said several people linked to dos Santos were also named as formal suspects, including Nuno Ribeiro da Cunha, director of private banking at small Portuguese lender Eurobic and manager of Sonangol’s account at the bank. Police said on Thursday Ribeiro da Cunha was found dead at the garage of his house in Lisbon on Wednesday night, after apparently committing suicide by hanging. He had tried to commit suicide earlier this month, police said.      No one at Eurobic was immediately available for comment.  Eurobic, in which dos Santos has owned a large stake, said on Wednesday she had decided to sell the stake.   The CMVM regulator said it wanted to find out if there is any relevant information that Galp and NOS should have provided to CMVM but did not.  Figueiredo Dias said hundreds of thousands of files about dos Santos, dubbed the “Luanda Leaks” and released on Sunday, were of “enormous importance” for the market regulator. The documents were obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and released by several news organizations.     The media reports focused on alleged financial schemes used by dos Santos to build her business empire, including transfers between Angola and Dubai. Dos Santos, who has been living abroad, said on Sunday that allegations made against her were “completely unfounded”. The scandal has led to several resignations, including Mario Leite da Silva, who resigned as chairman of Banco Fomento Angola on Monday, according to a letter seen by Reuters.  Silva, who could not immediately be reached for comment, also stepped down from his position as non-executive board member at Portuguese telecoms company NOS, where dos Santos holds a significant stake.  Two other non-executive board members at NOS resigned on Thursday, the company said in a statement.  Separately, auditors PwC said the firm had “taken action to terminate any ongoing work for entities controlled by members of the dos Santos family” following what it said were “very serious and concerning allegations”, and had begun an inquiry. Dos Santos has said allegations against her are politically motivated.  Authorities in Angola froze dos Santos’ assets there in late December. Asked about dos Santos’ case at the World Economic Forum, Angolan Finance Minister Vera Daves told Reuters “we need to send signs to society that we are committed to tackle corruption” and to manage public money and firms well. President Joao Lourenco, who succeeded dos Santos’s father in 2017, has cracked down on the role of his predecessor’s children, firing dos Santos from her job chairing Sonangol and her brother from the sovereign wealth fund.

"Power cuts cost South Africa up to $8.3 bln in 2019, research shows",Jan 22 2020,"JOHANNESBURG, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Power cuts by state utility Eskom cost the South African economy up to 120 billion rand ($8.3 billion) last year and will probably persist for the next two to three years, research by the country’s national science council showed. The power cuts are one of the biggest challenges facing President Cyril Ramaphosa as he tries to revive investor confidence in Africa’s most industrialised economy. Ramaphosa has promised to break up Eskom to make it more efficient and granted it a series of mammoth bailouts to stabilise its finances, but its coal-fired power plants keep breaking down after years of mismanagement. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) urged the government to move swiftly to ease regulations governing “self-generation” of electricity by companies and households as a way to minimise power cuts in 2020. Other government initiatives, such as giving independent power producers the go-ahead to build new plants, could only help reduce the scale of power cuts from 2021 if procurement processes are expedited or from 2022 under normal circumstances, the CSIR research showed. Ramaphosa promised in a speech to business leaders this month that he would embrace efforts by businesses and households to generate their own electricity, but his government is yet to follow through with the necessary regulatory reforms. The CSIR said the government should publish determinations to procure more power as soon as the first quarter of this year and talk to existing renewable energy producers about squeezing more electricity from their plants.

"Powered by SUVs, Hyundai turns in best quarter since early 2017",Jan 22 2020,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co () turned in its best quarterly operating profit in over two years and said it was on track for higher profit margins in 2020, powered by more sales of sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) such as the Palisade and Kona. The better-than-expected operating earnings, which fueled a rise in shares, indicates measures by Hyundai Motor Group heir-apparent Euisun Chung to revamp the image of the automaker known for its sedan-heavy lineup were beginning to pay off. So while overall vehicle sales for the South Korean company held mostly steady on year over October-December, its bottom line benefited as high-margin SUVs accounted for more of the sales mix - 42% versus 37% a year earlier. Hyundai said it would meet its target for a 5% operating profit margin this year, versus 3.5% in 2019, by selling even more SUVs and launching fully redesigned versions of some of its best-selling models, the Elantra sedan and the Tucson SUV. “We understand that achieving this year’s operating profit margin of 5% is more important than ever,” Kim Sang-hyun, head of finance and accounting division, said on an earnings call. “The company views this year as the first to fully establish a virtuous sales cycle by optimizing supplies, profits and strengthening brand competitiveness,” Kim said.  “We will do our best to secure a sustainable revenue base in a difficult business environment.”  Sales for Hyundai and affiliate Kia Motors () hit a seven-year low in 2019 as business in China slumped, missing their target for a fifth time, but they have forecast better numbers for this year. Hyundai expects SUVs to account for about 43% of its sales in 2020, helped by the launch of a new premium Genesis brand SUV in the second half, in addition to the GV80 launched  last week.  “The market has been skeptical of the 5% profit margin target, but the target seems to be achievable thanks to new Genesis models,” said Lee Jae-il, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities.  While Hyundai is seeing a recovery in U.S. sales, thanks to demand for new SUVs and a favorable currency exchange rate, its business in China continues to suffer amid a broader slowdown in the world’s biggest auto market. Its passenger car sales in China fell 4.8% on year in 2019. Hyundai, however, expects its wholesale vehicle sales in China to reach 730,000 this year from 650,000 vehicles in 2019. It also said it was looking for the best time to launch its premium Genesis brand in China and Europe. For October-December, Hyundai’s operating profit was 1.24 trillion won ($1 billion), highest since the second quarter of 2017.

"BlackRock, partners eye initial $500 million for climate fund",Jan 22 2020,"LONDON (Reuters) - A BlackRock-backed () group aims to raise an initial $500 million for a private equity fund that will invest in climate change-linked infrastructure upgrades in emerging markets. The group will provide the first $100 million of funding for the Climate Finance Partnership (CFP), which was set up in 2018 along with France, Germany and the Hewlett and Grantham charitable foundations, it said in a statement on Wednesday. The funding will go toward a first-loss tranche that will absorb any initial losses, a safety net for other institutional investors that BlackRock expects to help it raise at least another $400 million.  The CFP fund will be invested in renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy storage solutions and ultra-low and electric transport. At least a quarter of the investments would be made in Africa, with the rest in selected countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America, BlackRock said. The venture is part of a wide-ranging overhaul of the way BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, is responding to the issue of climate change, as part of a broader commitment to environmental, social and governance-related investing. Climate has also been at the forefront of this year’s annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, at which news of the planned initial fund-raising was announced. Finding novel ways to encourage accelerated investments has been a theme at Davos, and on Wednesday a separate $500 million United Nations-backed initiative also announced a plan to help achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, ‘SDG500’. The money raised will target businesses in the agriculture, finance, energy, education and healthcare sectors across many of the regions worst-hit by climate change. As with the CFP fund, the coalition of private and public sector organizations will also provide a first-loss layer for those investing in the project, which will provide exposure to six funds managed by asset manager Bamboo Partners.  In a recent annual letter to the thousands of companies in which BlackRock holds stakes, Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said the need to act on climate was “particularly urgent” given many cities were not built to withstand “the new climate reality”. France and Germany will both invest $30 million of the initial funding, while the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental Trust have pledged $10 million and $7.5 million, respectively. The CFP members have pledged to help raise the additional seed capital for the fund. BlackRock will also provide an as yet undetermined amount.

"Russia gets new government in what Putin calls ""major renewal""",Jan 22 2020,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin approved a new government on Tuesday which he described as a break with the past, bringing in some fresh faces but retaining many senior ministers.  The new government included a new economy minister and a new first deputy prime minister, but the finance, foreign, defense, energy and agriculture ministers all kept their jobs. The new team was formed less than a week after Putin unveiled a sweeping shake-up of the political system, which led to the resignation of his ally Dmitry Medvedev as prime minister along with the entire government. Putin went on to pick 53-year-old former tax chief Mikhail Mishustin, who has almost no political profile, as his new prime minister.  Putin’s wider shake-up, which envisages changing the constitution, is widely seen as preparing the ground for 2024, when Putin, now 67, is obliged to leave the presidency after occupying the Kremlin or the prime minister’s job continuously since 1999. Critics have long said Putin, a former KGB officer, wants to stay on in some capacity after his term ends so that he can wield power over the world’s largest nation and one of its two biggest nuclear powers. Tuesday’s new appointments could be intended to reboot the government’s flagging image and shift attention to Putin’s drive to lift falling real incomes and drive ahead with big national infrastructure projects which he hopes will catapult his country into a new economic league. “The most important task is to increase the welfare of our citizens and strengthen our statehood and the position of our country in the world. All these are absolutely attainable goals,” Putin told the new government. “We have achieved a very balanced government. We have enough people who worked in the previous government, as well as a major renewal.”      Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, Energy Minister Alexander Novak, Agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushev, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov all kept their jobs. Putin named Andrei Belousov, his economy advisor since 2013, as first deputy prime minister, replacing Anton Siluanov who had held the role since May 2018. Belousov, 60, in 2018 proposed making big metals and mining companies pay a windfall tax, sending their share prices lower, although that proposal was subsequently watered down.     Belousov also made headlines last year when he confirmed his friendship with businessman Artem Avetisyan, whose legal battle with private equity fund Baring Vostok has rattled the business community.     Putin approved 40-year-old Maxim Reshetnikov, a former regional governor, as the new economy minister, replacing Maxim Oreshkin who spent just over three years in the role. Reshetnikov has previously worked in the Moscow mayor’s office. Putin also replaced the minister of telecommunications. He named Maksut Shadaev, until now a vice president of state telecoms operator Rostelecom, to the role.  Abbas Gallyamov, a former government speech writer, said Putin had removed three people strongly disliked in certain parts of society - the ministers for culture and education, and a deputy prime minister who oversaw sport at the height of a doping scandal. “Previously the Kremlin said it would appoint who it wanted and didn’t care if people didn’t like their choice,” Gallyamov wrote on social media. “Now the logic has changed and the authorities do not want to irritate society.” But he said keeping on some political heavyweights, signalled there was little change in direction, adding: “Putin is clearly showing that substantive changes to the regime’s ideology are not planned.”  ","{'neg': 0.045, 'neu': 0.858, 'pos': 0.096, 'compound': 0.9835}",0.9835
UPDATE 3-Saudi Arabia raises $5 bln as bond investors brush off Gulf jitters,Jan 21 2020,"(Updates with size, details) By Davide Barbuscia DUBAI, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has raised $5 billion in bonds after receiving around $20 billion in orders, a sign that an escalation in  geopolitical tensions in the Gulf has not deterred investors looking for high returns amid low global rates. The kingdom has issued bonds with maturities of seven, 12 and 35 years, a document by one of the banks leading the deal showed, as part of plans to raise $32 billion worth of debt this year as it seeks new financing channels in an era of lower oil prices. The bond sale is the first by a Gulf government this year and follows a rise in geopolitical tensions in the region after Iran and the United States, Saudi Arabia’s ally, traded military strikes earlier this month. Riyadh raised $1.25 billion in seven-year bonds offering 85 basis points over U.S. Treasuries, $1 billion in 12-year notes with a spread of 110 basis points over the benchmark, and $2.75 billion in 35-year bonds, the kingdom’s longest international bonds ever, with a 3.84% yield. Saudi Arabia’s dollar bonds, among the most liquid in the region, have been relatively resilient after an attack on the facilities of state-owned oil giant Aramco last year and a U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani this month. The spreads on offer looked “cheap” when the bond sale began on Tuesday, particularly for the longer dated tranches, said Zeina Rizk, fixed income executive director at Dubai’s Arqaam Capital. “There is definitely a risk premium linked to geopolitical risk, but markets didn’t sell off as much as you would have expected them to after the Aramco attack or after Soleimani’s strike. Initial price guidance is cheap but it will obviously tighten,” she said. Alberto Bigolin, executive director and head of MENA fixed income at Tellimer, said the initial premium was erased completely during the sale process. “Both the action on the Saudi sovereign curve in the past weeks and the pricing of the new issuance confirm that the demand for Saudi risk is there, despite the heightened geopolitical risk and the recent tensions in the Gulf.” Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Standard Chartered worked as joint global coordinators and lead managers, while BNP Paribas, HSBC, JPMorgan and NCB Capital have been hired as passive lead managers. Of Saudi Arabia’s total planned debt issuance this year, almost $12 billion will be used to refinance existing local debt and will also be raised locally, a finance ministry official told Reuters last month.

"Saudis ask U.S. to remove Sudan from terrorism list, TV reports",Jan 22 2020,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has asked the United States to remove Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, Saudi state TV said on Wednesday, citing Minister of State for African Affairs Ahmed bin Abdul Aziz Qattan. The U.S. government added Sudan to its list of state sponsors of terrorism in 1993 over allegations that then-President Omar al-Bashir’s Islamist government was supporting terrorist groups. The designation makes Sudan technically ineligible for debt relief and financing from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Congress needs to approve a removal.  Bashir was toppled by the military last year. A civilian transitional government, formed in August, agreed with the United States that it could start engaging with international institutions while still on the list. Saudi Arabia supported the overthrow of Bashir, in what analysts believed reflected its coordinated efforts with the United Arab Emirates to curtail the regional influence of the Muslim Brotherhood, who backed his regime.

Sberbank CEO could resign if shareholder change modifies strategy: RIA,Jan 23 2020,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - German Gref, the chief executive of Russia’s Sberbank (), could leave his post if a possible shareholder change at the bank results in a switch in its strategy, the RIA news agency quoted him as saying on Thursday. The Russian government has been in talks with the central bank to buy the latter’s 50% plus one share stake in Sberbank, the country’s largest lender. “When I came to this position, I came with a certain approach,” said Gref, who has served as the bank’s CEO since 2007.  “If this approach changes, I don’t see my place in the company.” Gref said he hoped a shareholder change would not modify the bank’s strategy. “We strongly believe that the strategy is the right one,” he was quoted as saying. “We have had interesting discussions with the government regarding the use of our platform for digital services. We are very interested (in this), I hope we will move in that direction,” Gref added.  Management of Sberbank remains on track to recommend a dividend payment of 50% of net income for 2019, but the payment will be subject to final approval by board of directors and shareholders, Gref said. Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev said on Wednesday that the mechanism behind the central bank’s potential exit from Sberbank’s shareholder structure was being discussed and that a final decision had yet to be made.  If the government did in fact take over the central bank’s shares, Sberbank would come under the control of Russia’s federal government property agency, he said. Despite his concern about a switch in strategy, Gref told state television on Thursday he was more optimistic about the prospect of a change in shareholder. “I would say that I feel more positively than negatively about this,” he said, speaking from the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Shareholder in Russia's Alrosa proposes selling up to $1 billion of diamonds to Gokhran: Ifax,Jan 21 2020,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The government of Russia’s Yakutia region, a major shareholder in diamond producer Alrosa, has proposed that precious metals and gems repository Gokhran buy $0.5-$1 billion of the firm’s rough diamonds this year, Interfax news agency reported. The proposal was made to President Vladimir Putin and Russia’s finance ministry, which is responsible for Gokhran within the government, Interfax quoted Aysen Nikolaev, the head of Yakutia region, as saying on Tuesday. Diamond miners are battling falling demand, as well as competition from diamonds manufactured in laboratories.  Alrosa is the world’s largest producer of rough diamonds in carat terms. Together with Anglo American’s De Beers unit, it produces about half of the world’s rough diamonds. The company said in a statement to Reuters that such a sale would only be undertaken if the market situation deteriorates significantly. The company remains profitable and fully able to meet its social obligations, it said.  “Based on the results of the Christmas retail season, we see signs of a revival of demand in the main market and a decrease in midstream stocks,” Alrosa added. Nikolaev, also first deputy chairman of Alrosa’s board of directors, said in an interview with Interfax that “there are different options - from $500 million to $1 billion”. “Any option suits us,” he added. “Perhaps, it makes sense (for Alrosa) not to sell them for several years before demand recovers, but to sell them to Gokhran, as was done in the late 2000s,” Nikolaev said. Gokhran bought diamonds worth $1 billion from Alrosa, which is 33% held by Yakutia and its regions, during years of weak demand caused by the global financial crisis in 2008-2009. If approved by the finance ministry and the government, the proposal would require a sharp increase in Gokhran’s current 2020 budget for purchases, as it is limited to 10.5 billion roubles ($170 million). The Yakutia region, Alrosa’s management and the finance ministry have agreed to review the idea in detail after Alrosa’s first-half sales, Nikolaev said.

UPDATE 1-South Africa appoints new board at state nuclear firm,Jan 21 2020,"(Adds detail, context) JOHANNESBURG, Jan 21 (Reuters) - South Africa’s energy minister Gwede Mantashe has appointed seven board members at state nuclear firm Necsa, Mantashe’s ministry said on Tuesday. Necsa is one of the world’s largest producers of medical radioisotopes and promotes research and development in nuclear energy. It has been mired in a financial and operational crisis, like other South African state-run firms including power utility Eskom, but is much less of a burden on the country’s stretched public finances due to its smaller size. The appointments follow the resignation last week of Necsa’s remaining board members. Local media have cited disagreements with Mantashe over how to revive the company as the cause of the resignations, although his ministry has not given a reason for them. Eskom’s former chief nuclear officer David Nicholls will chair the new Necsa board. ","{'neg': 0.101, 'neu': 0.835, 'pos': 0.064, 'compound': -0.824}",-0.824
"South African Airways should be saved, says ruling ANC",Jan 22 2020,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Heavily-indebted South African Airways (SAA) should be retained as a national airline but needs substantial restructuring, a top official in the governing African National Congress (ANC) party said on Wednesday. SAA is running out of cash after the government failed to provide 2 billion rand ($138 million) of emergency funding it promised when the airline entered a form of bankruptcy protection last month. Government officials say they still want to give SAA the promised funds, but Finance Minister Tito Mboweni is insisting the transfer be done in a way that avoids increasing the country’s budget deficit. Time is running out for potential options that include the sale of state assets. “SAA should be retained as a national airline, which will require substantial restructuring. The Cabinet should take the operational decisions needed to achieve this,” ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule told reporters. Magashule, one of the ANC’s top six officials, was among those who attended a four-day meeting of ANC leaders to debate the economy and struggling state firms that ended on Monday.  SAA is among several South African state entities, including power company Eskom, that are mired in financial crisis after nearly a decade of mismanagement. State companies’ financial problems are seen as one of the biggest threats to Africa’s most industrialized economy and have helped to push the country’s credit rating to the brink of junk status. On Tuesday, SAA said it had canceled more than 20 domestic flights between its Johannesburg hub and Cape Town and Durban this week, and 10 international flights to and from Munich, to save dwindling cash reserves. The airline has not made a profit since 2011 and has received more than 20 billion rand in bailouts over the last three years. Last year the government’s patience ran out. Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan allowed SAA to enter “business rescue,” a bankruptcy protection process that shields the airline from creditors’ demands while an independent adviser takes over. Since then, SAA has burned through 2 billion rand of funds from lenders. Finance Minister Mboweni told state broadcaster SABC in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos that officials from his ministry were “working feverishly” to secure the extra 2 billion rand SAA urgently needs. “It’s very important that happens in a fiscally-neutral way because we don’t have an appropriations bill that can find an additional 2 billion rand,” he said. “We will try to support SAA as much as we can.” ","{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.832, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': 0.3358}",0.3358
Spain's ACS withdraws from Inga 3 hydro project in Congo,Jan 22 2020,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s ACS is withdrawing from the multi-billion-dollar Inga 3 hydroelectric project in Democratic Republic of Congo, the company said on Tuesday, dealing a further setback to plans to develop Africa’s largest hydro plant.  A consortium led by Actividades de Construccion y Servicios signed a preliminary agreement with one led by China Three Gorges [CYTGP.UL] in 2018 to jointly develop the 11,000 megawatt project. However, the two sides had been unable to agree on how to proceed to construction. An ACS spokesman told Reuters: “The ACS group will not participate in the execution of the project.” He provided no explanation for the decision to withdraw.  The head of the government agency overseeing development of Inga 3, part of a planned series of dams along the Congo River that could eventually produce more than 40,000 MW, said Congo was awaiting formal notification of ACS’s withdrawal.  It said however that the project would proceed. “Let’s wait and see. The important thing for me is that Inga has become a reality, and is attracting interest from many developers,” Bruno Kapandji told Reuters. The long-mooted project has been plagued by financing issues. In 2016 the World Bank suspended tens of millions of dollars in funding, criticizing Inga 3’s “strategic direction” after the government assigned the portfolio to the president’s office. Elisabeth Caesens, director of Brussels-based advocacy group Resource Matters, said ACS had been on the fence for while and did not want to commit extra money to such a risky investment. “While ACS added weight to the ProInga consortium, it was not its driving force,” Caesens said.  “We can expect the remaining Spanish company and the Chinese majors with which it has been asked to form a joint consortium to actively look for a more enthusiastic partner to integrate the team.”  Resource Matters said in a report in October that Spanish company AEE Power was the more active player in the ProInga consortium with ACS.   In December, Congo President Felix Tshisekedi floated the idea of reverting to earlier plans to build Inga 3 with a 4,800-MW capacity, and gradually expand later. Disagreements over the sequencing of the project and ownership stakes led to a breakdown in cooperation between the Chinese and Spanish consortia late last year. Much of the output from Inga 3, which was expected to take eight years to build, has been earmarked for South Africa, with the rest going toward Congo’s mining sector and population.

The sale, which is set to close in the third quarter of 2020, will generate net capital gains of 351 million euros for Sabadell and boost its common equity tier 1 ratio (CET-1) by 43 basis points, according to the statement. The unit has assets under management of around 21.8 billion euros, excluding third-party funds. The deal will be financed through the existing cash of the French asset management company, the statement added. Amundi, Europe’s biggest asset manager, has been present in Spain since 2002 through its Amundi Iberia subsidiary. The units of Sabadell Asset Management and Amundi Iberia will remain separate legal entities, the companies said, citing the need to preserve their operations of investment funds and pension plans. Amundi has grown through sizeable deals in the past, including the purchase of UniCredit’s asset management unit Pioneer Investments, which it bought for 3.6 billion euros in 2016. Commenting on the deal, brokerage Jefferies said the price was lower than expected. “We note the price is materially less than the 700 million euros that was posited back in October,” Jefferies said in a note.

Swedish refiner Nynas proposes restructuring to escape U.S. sanctions,Jan 21 2020,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish oil refiner Nynas, which is owned by Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA and Finland’s Neste Oil, said on Tuesday it planned to reorganize its business in an attempt to disentangle itself from U.S. sanctions imposed on Venezuela. Nynas said the proposed changes to its ownership structure, backed by both PDVSA and Neste Oil, were filed with the United States’ Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on January 17. The refiner, which was placed in the hands of a court-appointed administrator late last year, added that it would only proceed with the changes if and when OFAC confirmed that the move would mean Nynas no longer being subject to its sanctions. “The sanctions against PDVSA and Venezuela have had a considerable negative impact on Nynas’ operations. It is therefore necessary to immediately make changes to the ownership structure,” the company said in a 17-page document.  The reorganization is vital for the Swedish refiner, which said in December that the sanctions had cut it off from bank funding and left it unable to pay its debts. Nynas said on Tuesday that relief from the sanctions would allow it to trade in U.S. dollars and access credit again.  The United States in October introduced changes to a license that had previously allowed Nynas to import Venezuelan oil despite sanctions imposed on its owner PDVSA, sparking a crisis at the refiner which employs about 1,000 people in Sweden, Germany and Britain. Nynas said in the document it had engaged Carnegie Investment Bank AB to secure short-term bridge financing of 1.5 billion Swedish crowns ($158 million) and attract new investors. The company, which specializes in products for asphalt production, said it now needs to purchase oil as its current stock runs out in March. Nynas added that it does not expect to be able to buy Venezuelan oil even if OFAC approves the changes, meaning it will need to find new suppliers and adapt its equipment.  Nynas said the restructuring plan does not include any job cuts. ","{'neg': 0.052, 'neu': 0.868, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': 0.8481}",0.8481

The company opened its first store in Glasgow in 1988 with quirky details on suits, shirts and dresses helping it to stand out from retail rivals and grow to its 560 stores and concessions globally. Ted Baker has, however, seen its fortunes turn for the worse after allegations against former chief executive and founder Ray Kelvin relating to his habit of hugging business colleagues surfaced in 2018. Kelvin denies any improper conduct. Following is a timeline of challenges the retailer has faced since then: Ted Baker says it will investigate claims against Kelvin relating to his habit of hugging business colleagues. Kelvin takes a voluntary leave of absence while allegations about his conduct were being investigated. Kelvin resigns as chief executive, seeking to allow the fashion brand he founded to move on from misconduct allegations. Ted Baker reports its first drop in annual profit since the 2008 financial crisis, highlighting tough conditions on Britain’s high streets. Ted Baker names company veteran Lindsay Page as its boss, also introducing changes to workplace standards. The company warns that underlying profit for the year will fall short of analysts’ estimates after an “extremely difficult” start to 2019. Media reports say Kelvin would support a private equity buyout months after he quit over allegations of misconduct. Ted Baker appoints Debenhams veteran Rachel Osborne as its new finance chief. Ted Baker issues its second profit warning in four months on the back of what it calls the worst business conditions in decades. Ted Baker says it may have overstated inventory by as much as 25 million pounds. Ted Baker’s CEO Lindsay Page and Chairman David Bernstein, make a sudden exit as it issues another profit warning and suspends its dividend. An accounting scandal at Ted Baker is more than twice as big as initially estimated, the British fashion retailer said. Ted Baker said non-executive director Jennifer Roebuck will become chief customer officer, a newly created role, and that the search for a permanent chief executive officer and chairman was still in progress.

Tanzanian home affairs minister fired over $453 million contract,Jan 23 2020,"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzanian President John Magufuli fired his home affairs minister Kangi Lugola on Thursday, accusing him of mismanaging a 408 million euro ($453 million) fire department contract. Magufuli, who faces re-election for a second five-year term this year, has cultivated the image of a hard-nosed leader who swiftly fires ministers and officials who do not toe his line.

Lugola said he accepted the president’s decision to relieve him of his cabinet post. “The president is the one who appointed me in the cabinet of ministers and he is the one who has relieved me from the cabinet,” he told reporters. “I will continue to support him and his government with due respect.” Other officials named in the deal, including the commissioner general of the fire department, had no immediate comment.

"Tax avoidance, evasion costs EU 170 billion euros a year, says Poland",Jan 22 2020,"WARSAW (Reuters) - European Union member states lose 170 billion euros ($188.38 billion) a year due to tax avoidance and evasion, a Polish state think-tank said in a report due to be discussed later on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos. The report, from the Polish Economic Institute, also proposed that the European Commission should have powers to sanction as “EU tax havens” countries that benefited from what it called artificial profit-shifting by companies.  “Losses resulting from the use of international transactions for tax fraud and tax avoidance reduce EU Member States’ revenues by around 170 billion euros annually,” Piotr Arak, the director of the Polish Economic Institute, said in a statement. “The Union should take integrated measures to seal the tax system in order to have an additional source of financing for the new budget, to be constructed without the United Kingdom, a major payer,” the institute said. The report is to be discussed on Wednesday evening in Davos, with speakers including Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. The broader issue of tax has been high on the agenda at Davos, with a battle brewing between the United States and Europe over how the world’s biggest technology firms are taxed. Out of 170 billion euros the EU loses every year 60 billion euros comes from artificial profit-shifting by multinational companies -  moving earnings from a higher tax jurisdiction to a country with a lower tax rate - 46 billion euros due to moving wealth by rich individuals, and 64 billion euros due to cross-border VAT fraud, the institute said. The countries worst-hit by losses due to artificial profit shifting were: Germany (18 billion euros), Britain (14 billion), and France (11 billion), it said. “Some EU Member States benefit from the artificial profit shifting process and should be called EU tax havens,” the report added. “These are: the Netherlands, Ireland, Belgium, Luxemburg, Malta and Cyprus.” Overall tax losses for EU countries over seven years add up to 1,190 billion euros, or a quarter more than the whole EU budget for 2014-2020 which amounts to 960 billion euros, the institute said. The Polish Economic Institute’s remit is to supply the government with analysis to support its development plans for the country. Since 2015 Poland has been ruled by the Law and Justice (PiS) party and remains at loggerheads with the EU over judiciary reforms, rule of law, environment and migration policy.

Thai monetary policy should be accommodative for some time: central bank,Jan 22 2020,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand’s central bank said monetary policy should remain accommodative for some time to support economic growth and help inflation return to target.  The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) expects headline inflation - projected at 0.8% this year - to get back to the 1%-3% target range in the second half of 2021, the central bank said in an open letter to the finance minister dated Jan. 9. The breach of the target would be driven by supply-side pressures that would remain low, since a gradual global economic recovery continues to weigh on global energy prices, it said. “Looking ahead, the MPC views accommodative monetary policy should be maintained for some time so that overall financial conditions remain conducive to economic growth,” it said.  That “will facilitate the return of headline inflation to target, and at the same time takes into consideration financial stability risks,” the central bank said. (GRAPHIC: Thailand's Policy rate, GDP and CPI - ) The MPC stands ready to use various tools, ranging from the policy interest rate to microprudential and macroprudential measures, to achieve the monetary policy objectives most effectively, it added. The central bank left the benchmark interest rate THCBIR=ECI unchanged at a record low of 1.25% in December, after cutting it twice earlier in the year to support flagging growth and curb a strengthening baht . It will next review monetary policy on Feb. 5 The MPC has closely monitored the impact of exchange rates on the export sector given heightened external risks, the central bank said. Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy is heavily reliant on exports, which have been hit by global trade tensions.

Thailand plans new tax incentives to boost investment,Jan 23 2020,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand’s finance ministry will submit to the cabinet on Tuesday a package of tax incentives to encourage investment, a deputy prime minister said on Thursday, as the government looks to revive a flagging economy. The Thai economy has lagged most of its peers for years, with exports weak and investment sluggish. The government estimated growth of 2.6% in 2019, a five-year low. The finance ministry has been asked to consider more generous tax incentives to attract domestic and foreign investment this year, Somkid Jatusripitak told reporters.     “Currently, we offer a tax deduction of 1.5 times on investment. But the new package will offer more, plus many other measures, Somkid said. “This will definitely increase investment even more”. Finance Minister Uttama Savanayana told reporters that the ministry planned to offer a tax deduction of 2.5 times on investment, and there would be tax exemptions on imports of machinery. Both measures, to be introduced during January-December, are expected to draw investment of more than 100 billion baht ($3.29 billion), he added. “It’s the first time that we will offer this high 2.5 times (tax deduction),” he said. “Both measures will cost the government about 9 billion in lost revenue. But it’s worth it”. Uttama said the government would also offer soft loans for businesses. Somkid said the Board of Investment was also planning additional measures to support investment. Last year, Thailand offered a relocation package to draw foreign companies seeking to move production because of Sino-U.S. trade tensions. Somkid said the government would also accelerate large transport projects, the auction of 5G spectrum and offer  investment by state companies to help improve business activity. On trade, the government is working on membership in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), Somkid said. A fund will be provided to help business that may be affected by the deal, he said. Membership could be a boon for Thailand as competition heats up in electronics, seafood and agriculture from rival export and manufacturing economies, such as Malaysia and Vietnam.

Thailand's $105 billion budget faces further delay,Jan 22 2020,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand’s 3.2 trillion baht ($105.40 billion) budget for the current fiscal year, aimed at reviving a flagging economy, faces further delay as lawmakers seek a court ruling on the validity of the parliament vote to approve it. Parliament passed the draft bill, which was expected to be effective in early February, this month, delayed from Oct. 1, when the fiscal year began. The House of Representatives will now ask the Constitution Court to rule whether the vote was valid following the discovery that a lawmaker’s voting card was used when the lawmaker was not present. “We will send this matter to the court tomorrow,” an official at the lower house told Reuters. The proposed budget foresees a 7% rise in overall spending to 3.2 trillion baht for the current fiscal year. It sets a deficit of 469 billion baht, up 4.2% from the 2019 fiscal year. On Wednesday, Finance Minister Uttama Savanayana told reporters that any further delay in the budget should not affect investor confidence. “If the budget is further delayed, the finance ministry’s agencies will consider measures and other options,” he said. “Seeking a bill to borrow for investment is one option.” Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy has lagged most regional peers for years. The central bank forecast economic growth of 2.8% this year, slightly picking up from an estimated 2.5% in 2019, a five-year low.

"Trump administration won't turn over auto import probe report, defying Congress",Jan 22 2020,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is snubbing Congress by refusing to turn over a report detailing an investigation into national security risks potentially posed by imported vehicles and auto parts, citing pending international negotiations and executive branch deliberations. Congress inserted a provision in a spending bill last month demanding the White House turn over the long-secret government report that U.S. President Donald Trump used to declare in May 2019 that some unnamed imported autos pose risks to national security. Trump opted not to impose any immediate tariffs on imported cars or auto parts because of the alleged security threat and then ordered another six-month review on a decision on tariffs of up to 25%. The delay was to allow for more time for trade talks with the European Union and Japan. A person briefed on the matter said Trump had relied on a Justice Department opinion to order Commerce not to turn over the report under a Section 232 investigation. The Commerce Department said in a statement it was “not releasing the 232 autos report because releasing it now would interfere with the President’s ability to protect confidential executive branch communications and could interfere with ongoing negotiations.” Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican, blasted the decision saying “by refusing to make public the statutorily-required report on automobile tariffs, the Department of Commerce is willfully violating federal law.” Toomey said he was “evaluating the potential for corrective action to compel the rightful release of this report.” On Tuesday, Trump said he was still considering imposing tariffs and mentioned imported European vehicles in particular, without singling out any brands. “We expect to be able to make a deal with Europe. And if they don’t make a deal, we’ll certainly give that very strong consideration,” Trump said. “But if we’re unable to make a deal, we will have to do something.” The Justice Department opinion, seen by Reuters before it was and made public on Tuesday, said Trump was justified in “withholding the report until the resolution of diplomatic negotiations” and any subsequent action. It said he could “rely on the constitutional doctrine of executive privilege to decline to release the report.” A spokesman for Senator Chuck Grassley, the Republican who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said the Justice Department memo “doesn’t seem to have much merit on its face. The law as passed by Congress is clear.” The White House declined comment. Some U.S. lawmakers want to restrict presidential authority to invoke the tariffs on national security grounds. In May, Trump said he agreed with the undisclosed report’s finding that found some imported cars and trucks were  “weakening our internal economy” and threatened to harm U.S. national security. But automakers have warned tariffs would cost hundreds of thousands of auto jobs, dramatically raise prices on vehicles and threaten industry spending on self-driving cars. An ad hoc group called “Here for America” representing major German and Asian automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG () and Nissan Motor Co, said “there is no compelling reason not to disclose this report to the public, or to restrict trade in an industry that supports the jobs of millions of Americans.” It previously called the national security designation “absurd.” ","{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.099, 'compound': 0.8975}",0.8975
Trump laments missing Davos star Greta's speech,Jan 22 2020,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump called climate activists like Greta Thunberg “prophets of doom” at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday. By Wednesday he was lamenting not having watched the teenage activist’s speech. The gentler tone, along with a promise to join a plan to plant one trillion trees, hinted at a different approach from the U.S. president, who in the past has dismissed climate change as “fake news” and told Thunberg she needs “anger management”. Either way, the first two days of the annual Davos gathering were dominated by the back-and-forth between the 73-year-old former businessman and the 17-year-old campaigner, with corporate leaders caught in the middle, concerned that as well as words, there was a need for concrete decisions. Thunberg doubled down at Davos. “Our house is still on fire,” the Swede said, decrying the “empty words and promises” of leaders and their message that children — millions of whom have joined Thunberg’s Friday protests around the world — should not worry. “Your inaction is fuelling the flames,” she said. On Wednesday, she met Britain’s Prince Charles, 71, a life-long environmentalist who tries to keep out of politics. “Everything I have tried to do, and urge, over the past fifty years has been done with our children and grandchildren in mind,” Charles said shortly before sitting down with Thunberg. He said he did not want to be accused by his descendants of doing nothing “except prevaricate and deny the problem”. “Now, of course, they are accusing us of exactly that.” Trump and the British heir to the throne did not cross paths, but as he left the mountain resort, Trump told reporters he would have liked to have heard Thunberg speak. Business leaders suggested Trump had been listening. Asked if he had convinced Trump to join the trillion trees initiative, Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff paused and smiled before telling Reuters “many people” were involved. And Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of German giant Siemens, told Reuters he had advised Trump to listen to young activists. “We have to sit together and involve them in dialogue,” he said he had told the U.S. president. Asked by reporters if he still thought climate change was a hoax, Trump responded: “No, not at all.”  But he said Thunberg should shift her attention away from the United States to focus on other, more polluted countries. “You have another continent where the fumes are rising at levels that you can’t believe ... I think Greta ought to focus on those places,” he said. Other leaders sought to draw a middle ground between Trump and Thunberg. French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said the Europeans were leading with a different approach. “There exists a third way between Donald Trump and Greta Thunberg,” he told reporters.  “There’s no need to fall into extremes, between those who say either that there is no problem with global warming or those who lament that nothing has been done to combat it, because it’s not true – there are things that have been done.” Mark Carney, the outgoing head of the Bank of England who will shortly become a United Nations’ envoy for climate policy, praised Thunberg for raising awareness of climate change. “There are those who will be out front in the transition and those who lag. And that’s different than a binary green-good, everything else brown-bad,” he said. “There should be fifty shades of green, if not more.”  ","{'neg': 0.065, 'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': 0.4809}",0.4809
"Trump's parting gifts, the Piano Man, Greta meets a prince - Davos Wednesday highlights",Jan 23 2020,"(Reuters) - The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) rolled on into Wednesday in the Swiss ski resort of Davos.  Here are the highlights from Day 2: A day after dismissing climate activists as “prophets of doom,” U.S. president Donald Trump said he would have loved to have seen Greta Thunberg speak at Davos. Their battle over climate change has dominated the first two days, with business leaders caught in the middle, concerned that as well as the words, there was a need for concrete decisions and action.  A confident Carrie Lam insisted she was staying on as the Chinese-ruled city’s leader and dismissed calls to step down. At times laughing and smiling, Beijing-backed Lam said that she had to stay on to tackle an economic crisis and the coronavirus, which has killed 17 people in mainland China. Prince Charles shook hands with Thunberg after telling attendees it was time for everyone in a leadership role to take action “at revolutionary levels and pace” and listen to young people when it comes to climate change.  “Everything I have tried to do, and urge, over the past fifty years has been done with our children and grandchildren in mind, because I did not want to be accused by them of doing nothing except prevaricate and deny the problem,” said Charles, who met Thunberg after his speech. “Now of course, they are accusing us of exactly that.” For 25 years he had the ear of world leaders, CEOs and even rock stars at Davos, but the Swiss ski resort’s most-listened to man has moved on. Barry Colson, a 56-year-old piano player who lives in Halifax, Canada, led a nightly songfest for WEF attendees as the musician-in-residence at the upstairs bar of the Hotel Europe. Now, he has opened up his own shop about 450 meters away. Calling a truce until the end of the year, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he had agreed with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that France would not require companies to pay its digital tax this year and that Mnuchin had agreed to suspend the tariff threat in the mean time. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy: The world cannot be united only in Facebook, when people re-post Greta Thunberg’ speech, or photos of horrible fires in Australia, or photos of a downed, unfortunately, Ukrainian plane in Iran.

Turkish bank probe casts wide net over trading: sources,Jan 22 2020,"ANKARA/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish competition officials made surprise visits to several private, state and foreign banks late on Friday to analyze computers as they opened a wide-ranging probe of trading in the financial sector, according to three bankers.  Turkey’s Competition Authority told Reuters on Tuesday it was conducting “preliminary research” into banks, as it regularly does in all sectors, adding it could not say more about the effort until the process is completed.  Turkish media reported on Friday that the competition authority, which is part of the Ministry of Trade, was investigating possible violations in foreign-exchange, deposit, credit and brokerage services.  Two Turkish broadcasters have said that more than 20 banks are involved. Bankers said it was unclear exactly what the competition officials were investigating.  One banker said officials fanned out across Istanbul and simultaneously entered the lenders late on Friday afternoon. They sat down at trading desks to analyze computers, and requested more transaction information that is due this week, the person said. “The investigation that started on Friday was a surprise to us,” said a second banker, who also requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject.  The competition authority was not working with the BDDK banking regulator, which usually does such audits and would have access to some of the information being sought, the second banker said.  “This is why it raises question marks since we don’t exactly know what they are looking for,” the person said. “All operations by banks are being investigated.” The government has clamped down on financial markets with a series of new rules and regulations since a currency crisis in 2018 knocked nearly 30% off the value of the Turkish lira.  The changes - including curbs on foreign-exchange and reserve requirements meant to boost lending - were meant to stabilize the currency and kick-start a recovery from recession.  In 2013, the competition authority fined 12 banks a total of 1.1 billion lira ($620 million at that time) for collusion on interest rates. In 2017, it probed 13 banks over corporate loans. A senior banker said the latest investigation was routine, while Finance Minister Berat Albayrak was quoted as saying on Monday he had heard about the investigation from the sector. “There is nothing to be concerned about,” Albayrak was quoted as telling local reporters.

U.S. existing home sales surge to near two-year high,Jan 22 2020,"WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. home sales jumped to their highest level in nearly two years in December, the latest indication that lower mortgage rates are helping the housing market to regain its footing after hitting a soft patch in 2018. The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday that existing home sales increased 3.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million units last month, the highest level since February 2018. November’s sales pace was unrevised at 5.35 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales would increase 1.3% to a rate of 5.43 million units in December. Last month, existing home sales rose in the Northeast, West and the populous South. But sales fell in the Midwest. Existing home sales, which make up about 90% of U.S. home sales, surged 10.0% on a year-on-year basis in December. For all of 2019, sales were unchanged at 5.34 million units. The report came on the heels of government data last week showing homebuilding surged to a 13-year high in December. The housing market is being supported by cheaper mortgage rates after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times last year. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to an average of 3.65% from its peak of 4.94% in November 2018, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. But the sector, which accounts for about 3.1% of gross domestic product, remains constrained by a lack of homes, especially in the lower-price segment of the market, because of land and labor shortages. There were a record-low 1.40 million previously owned homes on the market in December, down 14.6% from November and 8.5% from a year ago.

U.S. home sales surge to near two-year high; supply at record low,Jan 22 2020,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales jumped to their highest level in nearly two years in December, the latest indication that lower mortgage rates are helping the housing market to regain its footing after hitting a soft patch in 2018, though record low inventory could be an obstacle to continued strong gains. The report from the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday followed on the heels of government data last week showing homebuilding raced to a 13-year high in December. Renewed housing market momentum could soften some of the hit on the economy from manufacturing as the thaw in U.S.-China trade tensions is offset by Boeing’s () suspension this month of production of its troubled 737 MAX plane. “The previous weak link, housing, is coming back, but the current laggard, manufacturing, is slowing further,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. Existing home sales increased 3.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million units last month, the highest level since February 2018, boosted by a surge in sales of multi-family housing units and gains in single-family home dwellings. November’s sales pace was unrevised at 5.35 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales would increase 1.3% to a rate of 5.43 million units in December. Last month, existing home sales rose in the Northeast, West and the populous South. But sales fell in the Midwest. Existing home sales, which make up about 90% of U.S. home sales, surged 10.0% on a year-on-year basis in December. For all of 2019, sales were unchanged at 5.34 million units.

Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, also cheered by an upbeat forecast from IBM () and China’s efforts to contain a new flu-like virus outbreak. The dollar .DXY was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. The housing market is being supported by cheaper mortgage rates after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times last year. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to an average of 3.65% from its peak of 4.94% in November 2018, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.  But the sector, which accounts for about 3.1% of gross domestic product, remains constrained by a lack of homes,  especially in the lower-priced segment of the market, because of land and labor shortages.  The supply squeeze and resulting reacceleration in house price inflation could slow home sales this year. According to the NAR, there was a 14% drop from a year earlier in sales of houses priced $100,000 and below.  “Still, with rising incomes, more households being formed, and low mortgage rates, demand for housing should remain robust to keep home sales activity at an elevated level – although likely little changed from 2019,” said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.  December’s increase in existing homes sales likely means more in brokers’ commissions, which suggests that housing probably contributed to GDP growth again in the fourth quarter. Residential investment rebounded in the third quarter after contracting for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the 2007-2009 recession. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP to rise at a 1.8% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the July-September period. The government will publish its snapshot of fourth-quarter GDP next Thursday. There were a record-low 1.40 million previously owned homes on the market in December, down 14.6% from November and 8.5% from a year ago. As a result, the median existing house price soared 7.8% from a year ago, the most since January 2016, to $274,500 in December. House prices increased 4.8% in 2019. The NAR report likely exaggerates the pace of house price appreciation because of sampling methodology.  In a separate report on Wednesday, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) said its house price index rose a seasonally adjusted 4.9% in November from a year ago, slowing from an increase of 5.2% in October.  According to JPMorgan economist Daniel Silver, the FHFA measure is considered one of the more reliable house price measures “that control for changes in the mix of sales.” The NAR report showed that at December’s sales pace, it would take a record few 3.0 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.7 months in November.  A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. Last month, houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 41 days, up from 38 days in November, but down from 46 days a year ago. Forty-three percent of homes sold in December were on the market for less than a month.  First-time buyers accounted for 31% of sales last month, slightly down from 32% in November and a year ago. They accounted for 33% of all transactions in 2019. ","{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.885, 'pos': 0.067, 'compound': 0.9676}",0.9676
UK Treasury asks banks for ideas to boost 'left-behind' Northern towns,Jan 21 2020,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s finance ministry has canvassed banks for ideas to boost the country’s “left-behind” northern towns and cities, weeks after the governing Conservatives won an election promising to boost the regions outside London. The call comes as figures show lending by banks to small and medium sized businesses has shrunk rapidly in the north of England. Treasury officials have requested policy ideas for fuelling growth in the north of England in meetings with banks and finance industry trade bodies including since the new year, banking industry sources told Reuters. Policy ideas drawn up by finance firms include developing better technical skills locally, setting up regional specialist hubs and moving financial regulators from London to give start-ups better support in meeting requirements when setting up. Banks have attracted criticism for doing too little to support Britain’s regional economies, including slashing their branch networks in small towns and rural areas. Outstanding lending to small firms in the northwest and northeast of England fell by 15% and 8% respectively between the end of 2014 and June last year, according to data from trade body UK Finance, compared to a 2% increase in London. The regional lending trends were first reported by the Times newspaper.     A spokesman for the Treasury confirmed officials had asked finance firms how they could play a role in boosting the regions. “The financial services sector is vital to our economy, which is why we are working closely with firms to ensure that together we promote growth, create jobs and boost investment across the whole of the UK,” the spokesman added. The request comes ahead of finance minister Sajid Javid presenting the government’s budget in March. Javid has said injecting cash into the regions will be a priority. “We’ve been asked what do people in financial services need. It’s very northern-specific and very northern-focussed,” a banking source said. “There’s a recognition from officials that it can’t all be about delivering shiny new infrastructure projects.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party won a big majority last month, winning scores of seats in the north of England, traditional heartlands of the opposition Labour Party. Since then Johnson has pledged to ‘level up’ the regions to repay his new backers’ support, although opposition politicians have expressed scepticism and blame the Conservatives’ previous austerity policies for harming the regions. Finance jobs are heavily skewed toward London, although several other cities each employ more than 30,000 people in the sector, including Glasgow and Edinburgh in Scotland, and Leeds and Manchester in northern England. Britain has struggled for decades to find ways of fuelling regional growth outside London. The government already spends more than it generates in taxes in every part of Britain apart from London, the South-east and the East, according to Reuters analysis of public spending data. Miles Celic, CEO of TheCityUK, a finance industry trade group, said: “Ensuring the industry’s future as a national asset will require a concerted effort. This includes more regionally focused policies and initiatives.” ","{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.82, 'pos': 0.152, 'compound': 0.996}",0.996
"UK government borrows less than expected in December, but corporate tax take weakens",Jan 22 2020,"LONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Britain’s government borrowed less than expected in December but there were signs the economy’s weakness was hurting corporate tax receipts, while a pay rise for health workers pushed up spending. Borrowing excluding public sector-owned banks in December alone fell slightly compared with a year earlier to 4.765 billion pounds, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to borrowing of 5.3 billion pounds. Despite the better-than-expected figure for December, borrowing in the first nine months of the financial year stood at 54.6 billion pounds, 7.9% higher than it was for April-December 2018. The data showed corporate tax receipts for the financial year to date, April to December, were 3.4% lower than at the same point a year ago, the sharpest annual drop since the same period of the 2012/13 financial year. On the expenditure side, other current spending was up 5.0% in the financial year to date compared with the same period in 2018/19, a record increase that reflects a pay rise for health workers authorized by former prime minister Theresa May. After nearly a decade of austerity when the budget deficit fell from 10% of national income to under 2%, Britain’s Conservative government began last year to loosen the purse-strings, spending more on health care and public-sector pay. Finance minister Sajid Javid has announced the biggest increase in day-to-day spending in 15 years for the next financial year and has promised to use public investment to help voters in under-performing regions who gave Prime Minister Boris Johnson a thumping election win last month. Javid will deliver Britain’s first post-Brexit budget plan on March 11. Despite his promises of more funding, especially for infrastructure, Javid has set himself a rule of eliminating the deficit in day-to-day spending within three years which will restrict how much more he can spend on public services. The ONS said public-sector net debt totaled 80.8% of GDP in December, excluding public-sector banks, or 73.0% once the effect of a temporary Bank of England lending scheme was stripped out.

United States cautions Britain over Huawei,Jan 23 2020,"DAVOS/LONDON (Reuters) - The United States cautioned Britain ahead of a decision by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on what role Huawei will have in 5G telecommunications networks that Washington still had significant concerns about the Chinese telecoms behemoth. In the first big test of Brexit Britain’s foreign policy, Johnson has so far resisted intense pressure from President Donald Trump’s administration to block Huawei, which the United States fears could compromise British secrets. Huawei, the world’s biggest producer of telecoms equipment, denies it is a vehicle for Chinese intelligence and says the United States wants to ban it because no U.S. company can offer the same range of 5G technology at a competitive price. After a public disagreement between U.S. and British ministers in Davos over taxes on digital services, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that he would be meeting with British finance minister on Saturday on Huawei. “Let me just say again, it’s a complicated issue,” Mnuchin said. “We’ve made very clear that it relates to all of the critical areas that we have significant concerns. But again, there’s ongoing discussion on these issues.” Britain is expected to make a final call on how to deploy Huawei equipment in its 5G networks later this month. In what some have compared to the Cold War arms race, the United States is worried that 5G dominance would give any global competitor such as China an advantage Washington is not ready to accept. That puts Johnson on the spot with the United Kingdom’s closest security ally just as he seeks to negotiate post-Brexit trade deals with both the European Union and the United States - and juggle conflicting EU and U.S. policy on Iran.  Britain wants a trade deal with the United States but will still impose a digital service tax on the revenue of companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, business minister Andrea Leadsom said on Thursday. Leadsom said that Britain will soon decide what role Huawei will have but there are only a limited number of alternative providers, business minister Andrea Leadsom said on Thursday. “Well there are other providers but they are limited, ideally there would be more providers of infrastructure similar to the work that Huawei does but the UK is looking very carefully at this issue and we will be making a final decision soon,” Leadsom told Sky.     “It is an ongoing process and there are all sorts of factors to take into consideration, as you say, like the availability of other providers, like the work that Huawei has already done in the United Kingdom, so these discussions are ongoing,” she said. “I share the concerns of many citizens about protecting our national security interest,” Leadsom said.

Venezuela's Guaido will seek to return to Caracas after European tour,Jan 23 2020,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who defied a travel ban to seek support in Europe for new elections in his country, said on Wednesday he would attempt to return to Caracas but expected it to be dangerous. Speaking in the European Parliament in Brussels, Guaido also called on the EU to increase pressure on the government of President Nicolas Maduro through more sanctions, saying that while he believed in diplomacy, mediation had so far failed. “Yes I took a risk to leave ... my return will be risky,” he told a news conference following talks with EU lawmakers.     “It is sadistic what he (Maduro) is doing. He is torturing people, he is arresting people. Eighty percent of people in Venezuela can’t get proper water supplies. There is no electricity.” Comparing Venezuela’s plight to Syria and Yemen, Guaido said Maduro’s attempts to prevent him from being re-elected as the head of the opposition earlier this month had made him more determined to see the president unseated from power. He said several of his assistants in Caracas had been arrested in his absence. Guaido went on Tuesday to London, where he met British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, then to Brussels and will go to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.  “We need to put pressure on the dictatorship obviously. Sanctions will do that. We need to try to do everything possible to do that,” he said, adding that he was “hoping for a miracle.” EU countries, which recognize Guaido as interim president of Venezuela, have imposed economic sanctions on 25 Venezuelans close to Maduro, but have opted for a softer approach compared to the United States, seeking to help mediate talks toward new elections with Norway and Latin American countries. Guaido also appealed to EU governments to prohibit the trade of Venezuelan gold, a source of income for Maduro as oil production collapses, saying it was “blood gold” financing oppression.

UPDATE 1-Warren calls on big U.S. banks to disclose preparation for climate risk,Jan 22 2020,"(Adds link to Warren’s letter) By Ann Saphir and Lindsay Dunsmuir SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a contender for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination, is asking the biggest U.S. banks for details on their assessments of and preparations for risks related to global warming. “To protect themselves and the economy from climate-driven catastrophes, large financial institutions must act quickly to address risks,” Warren, a frequent critic of big banks, said in letters sent on Tuesday to top executives at Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, State Street and Wells Fargo. “I write to ask for more information about the risks caused by the climate crisis on the financial industry and your institution’s practices, including what steps, if any, your institution is taking to adapt to mitigate these risks,” she said in the letters warren-big-bank-letters.pdf, provided to Reuters. She asked for detailed written responses by Feb. 7. Over the past year a surge in natural disasters caused or exacerbated by warming temperatures, including bushfires in Australia, have driven climate change up the political agenda around the world and sparked protests demanding action. The threat has caught the attention of financial regulators concerned with how rising seas and other consequences of the build-up of human-generated greenhouse gases could impact financial stability by, for instance, eroding the value of homes against which banks have lent hundreds of billions of dollars. Regulators are also focused on assessing the potential impact of political responses to climate change on bank profitability and even viability, even as the world’s largest banks are increasingly targeted by activists for providing funding to fossil-fuel intensive industries, a major contributor to global warming. Led by the Bank of England, dozens of central banks have called for better disclosure of risks related to climate change and have begun mapping out approaches to banking sector supervision that take such risks into account. At its first-ever conference on climate change and economics last November, the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled it too may look at how to incorporate climate change risk into its assessments of financial stability. A panel convened by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission has begun its own effort to examine climate threats to the financial system. But overall, U.S. financial regulators lag their peers abroad. The current Republican U.S. administration has played down research on the risks of global warming and rolled back regulations designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions. On Tuesday, at the World Economic Forum in Davos where environmental issues have taken center stage, President Donald Trump dismissed those worried by climate change as “perennial prophets of doom.” Warren is among a group of leading Democrats vying for the party’s nomination to take on Trump in the November contest for U.S. president, but trails former Vice President Joe Biden and fellow U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in most opinion polls. All three are in favor of more government action to reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to limit impacts on the U.S. economy. Warren last year was a co-signer of a bill that would direct the Fed to “stress test” banks’ resilience to climate-related financial risks. In her letter, Warren asked the banks for details on how the proposed legislation would affect their operations as well as investments in oil companies, and whether they would support such a law. She also asked whether they formally assess climate-related risks and what changes they may have made in response. “As climate change continues to affect our economy, it is critical to understand your bank’s adaptation and mitigation strategies,” Warren wrote. Many large U.S. banks, including those receiving Warren’s letter, acknowledge that climate change poses a business risk and some make some disclosures about their own climate-related risks in line with recommendations from the international Financial Stability Board. Reuters asked each bank for comment on Warren’s letter after normal business hours. A JPMorgan spokesman said the bank was reviewing the letter. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman pointed to the environmental sustainability section of its website, which touts its financing of clean technology and environmental education.

Whatever the weather: Southern Africa tries new hunger fixes,Jan 22 2020,"JOHANNESBURG (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From drone-mapping in Mozambique to community radio weather programmes in Zambia, aid agencies are innovating to help millions of people in drought-ravaged southern Africa prepare for climate threats and produce enough food on a warming planet.  Across the region, a record 45 million people face growing levels of hunger due to repeated drought, widespread floods, lost harvests and an economic crisis in Zimbabwe, the World Food Programme (WFP) said last week. A business-as-usual approach to providing aid will no longer do, humanitarian officials said. “We cannot see food insecurity through an emergency lens alone,” said Michael Charles, head of the southern African office for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). “We will always be chasing shadows if we don’t take a step back, go back to the drawing board, and work as a collective on long-term solutions with more impact,” he added. Failing to do so would be “devastating”, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Over the past year, much of the central and western parts of southern Africa have experienced their lowest rainfall since 1981, according to the United Nations.  Lola Castro, WFP’s director for the region, told journalists last week a “silent catastrophe” was playing out. The humanitarian innovation required to address it includes the use of new technology like drones but also simple solutions that deploy limited resources effectively, said Bettina Koelle, a researcher with the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre. “Aid groups need to engage in constant dialogue with those most affected by climate shocks to understand what it is they need,” she said. “There are no quick fixes.”    Jesse Mason, an atmospheric scientist with WFP, and his team use long-term meteorological forecasts to predict weather patterns up to six months ahead and to finance humanitarian responses upfront.  Bringing these projections to government, donors and farmers can stop “the vicious cycle” of responding to climate shocks and redirect energy to better preparation, Mason said. Zambia’s government, meanwhile, has partnered with the United Nations Development Programme on a seven-year project aimed at safeguarding farmers’ incomes against climate threats. Using community radio broadcasts in local languages, forecasts are announced every hour to reflect erratic weather patterns, and tips provided on “climate-smart” agriculture. So far 170,000 small-scale farmers across 16 districts have been involved in the project, some via extension officers on motorcycles who bring new information directly to them.  In Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi, insurance schemes for 140,000 rural households have been rolled out by the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Co-operation (CTA), which is backed by African, Caribbean, Pacific and European states. Farmers sign up via their mobile phones, with low rainfall measurements triggering payouts they can use to purchase new seeds to replace crops destroyed by drought. “People are tired of hearing about climate problems,” said Oluyede Ajayi, a senior programme coordinator for the CTA.  “We need solutions - especially farmers whose families, livestock and livelihoods depend on them.”  The unpredictability of climate change makes data and information from the ground even more valuable, said Koelle. WFP has used drones to map vulnerable parts of Mozambique and Madagascar ahead of the upcoming cyclone season so they know where people are and how to get aid in, said Castro. “Drones will be used for the first time to help in search and rescue operations, to identify people stuck in trees so helicopters can come and pick them up,” she added.  This is much cheaper than using helicopters for the initial search, she noted.  U.N. children’s agency UNICEF has said drones hold great promise for delivering medical supplies to rural areas and responding to disasters like earthquakes and floods, with their potential being explored from Namibia to Kazakhstan. WFP is also working with farmers to improve post-harvest storage facilities, providing people with food vouchers to spend locally rather than bringing in supplies, and encouraging people to switch to more drought-resistant crops. Innovations are also being tested in other parts of Africa. Global aid group Action Against Hunger, for example, has created a “Pastoral Early Warning System” that uses satellite data to track drought and anticipate risks by measuring plant growth and surface water in the semi-arid Sahel, which skirts the Sahara desert. Koelle highlighted the need to consider where the limits to adaptation might lie. Where they are crossed, it might be necessary to put in place social welfare programmes, such as cash transfers for women-headed households, to ease suffering. Protecting people’s consumer choices is another important part of climate resilience, said the IFRC’s Charles.  Ensuring farmers have good links to markets to sell their harvests will help maintain their livelihoods and give them “choices about how they want to use their money”, he added.  “This gives people dignity and space to thrive, and to break out of the cycle of food insecurity”, he explained. For now, as southern Africa approaches the “lean” season - the period between planting and harvesting - aid groups are bracing for a tough few months. “We need to learn from what has happened already,” said Charles. “No single entity can fight climate change - we need resilience as a collective to get through this.” (This story refiles to fix acronym in para 29) ","{'neg': 0.078, 'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': 0.9742}",0.9742
Wirecard to beef up management; Braun to stay: new chairman,Jan 23 2020,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The new chairman of Wirecard said the German payments company needed to strengthen its top management as it fights allegations of fraud and false accounting, while giving Chief Executive Markus Braun a vote of confidence. Braun’s contract expiring at the end of this year will definitely be extended, Thomas Eichelmann told Manager Magazine in an interview published on Wednesday. Braun, 50, has had a difficult 12 months in which the Financial Times has alleged that Wirecard’s Singapore office committed fraud and its finance team conspired to inflate revenue and profit at its subsidiaries in Dubai and Ireland. Outside auditor KPMG was hired last autumn to investigate all the FT’s allegations and is expected to report back by the end of the first quarter. Wirecard itself denies wrongdoing. Eichelmann, a former chief financial officer of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange elected chairman in December, said Wirecard needed to beef up both its management and supervisory boards by two members each to ease the burden on Braun. “A management board member for personnel would make sense in my opinion, as would one for international marketing,” Eichelmann told Manager Magazine. “We could do with more capacity and competence in the supervisory board too.”Austrian Braun has run Wirecard since 2002 and owns a 7% stake in it that is worth 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion).

Women lose ground in German finance supervisory boards,Jan 22 2020,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Women’s representation on supervisory boards in Germany’s finance sector slipped in 2019, lagging other industries in gender balance, according to a study on Wednesday. Women held 22.8% of supervisory board seats at banks and 22.2% of those at insurance companies, down from 23.2% and 22.5% respectively the year before, according to the study by the German Institute for Economic Research, or DIW. The decline contrasts with other industries, where women had an overall 28.2% share of seats, an improvement on the previous year’s 26.9, DIW said. “It is striking that the financial sector is lagging behind,” Katharina Wrohlich, one of the authors, said in the report. Female representation on management boards rose slightly to 9.8% among banks and 11% among insurers, up from 8.7% and 9.6% respectively. Women hold 10.4% of management board seats in non-financial industries. DIW said that a reason for the discrepancy is that people in the financial sector, more so than in other industries, are disproportionately rewarded for working extremely long and inflexible hours, something that benefits men. In general across various industries, Germany fares better than the European Union average, according to DIW, but is well behind countries like France and Sweden. Some German companies have set targets to improve female representation. The online retailer Zalando (), for example, in October announced that by 2023 women should make up at least 40% of top positions, including on its supervisory and management board.

World financial intelligence group re-admits Vatican after suspension,Jan 23 2020,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican has been fully re-admitted to the Egmont Group of world financial intelligence units after a suspension two months ago sparked by an investigation into the purchase of luxury London real estate. Carmelo Barbagallo, president of the Vatican’s Financial Information Authority (AIF), said on Thursday the AIF would “resume its collaboration with foreign financial intelligence units in full transparency and in the spirit of active cooperation”. The Egmont Group’s president, Mariano Federici, had notified the AIF that it had been re-admitted to the use of Egmont’s secure communications network, Barbagallo said in a statement.  Egmont is a Toronto-based informal organization with about 165 members. Its secure network allows members to share information about crimes such as money laundering, tax fraud and terrorism financing. Egmont’s acceptance of the Vatican six years ago was seen as a major step forward in cleaning up the Vatican’s negative image following years of scandals, particularly involving its bank.  The suspension on Nov. 13 was a major setback for the Vatican, which risked again being seen as a pariah by the international financial community. On Oct. 1, Vatican police entered the offices of the AIF and of the Secretariat of State - the administrative heart of the Catholic Church - as part of their investigation of an investment the Secretariat had made in London real estate. The officers, operating under a search warrant secured by the Vatican’s own prosecutor, seized documents, computers and cellphones during the raids. The raid prompted concerns in the international financial community about the AIF’s ability to keep confidential documents secure and led to the suspension from Egmont. The suspension was lifted after the signing of a memorandum of understanding with Vatican prosecutors, the AIF statement said. Barbagallo, 63, a respected senior Bank of Italy official, was appointed by Pope Francis in November to succeed Swiss lawyer and anti-money laundering expert Rene Bruelhart. Bruelhart had headed the AIF for five years and the pope decided not to renew his mandate. Five Vatican employees were suspended after the Oct. 1 raids, including AIF director Tommaso di Ruzza. Domenico Giani, Vatican security chief and the pope’s bodyguard, resigned later over the leak of a document related to the investigation.

Xerox nominates new HP board after buyout rebuffs,Jan 23 2020,"(Reuters) - Xerox Holdings Corp said on Thursday it plans to nominate 11 independent candidates to HP Inc’s board, seeking to take control of the personal computer maker after several rejections of its $33.5 billion buyout offer. The U.S. printer maker made the cash-and-stock offer to HP, a company more than three times its size, in November. HP’s board rejected the offer saying it significantly undervalued the company. “HP shareholders have told us they believe our acquisition proposal will bring tremendous value, which is why we lined up $24 billion in binding financing commitments and a slate of highly qualified director candidates,” John Visentin, Xerox’s CEO, said on Thursday. HP, which has 12 board members, responded to Xerox’s decision to nominate candidates by again saying the bid undervalues the company. The company added that the move to nominate members to its board was being “driven” by activist investor Carl Icahn, who has a 4.2% stake in HP and a 10.9% stake in Xerox. In December, Icahn urged HP shareholders who agreed to the merger to reach out to the PC maker’s directors for immediate action.  The PC maker also said that due to Icahn’s ownership position, he would stand to “disproportionately benefit” if a deal between the companies happens. “These nominations are a self-serving tactic by Xerox to advance its proposal, which significantly undervalues HP and creates meaningful risk to the detriment of HP shareholders,” HP said in a statement. HP added that its board would review Xerox’s director nominees and respond in due course. Xerox’s slate of candidates include current or former executives from companies such as American Airlines, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Jefferies and Wynn Resorts. Both HP and Xerox have been facing a decline in demand as corporate clients choose to send emails rather than print out documents. While some Wall Street analysts have said a merger would help the companies in a declining printing market, others have cited challenges to integration, given their different offerings and pricing models. “I don’t think (the nomination) puts enough pressure on HP to agree to a merger, but it may cause HP to consider negotiations for a higher valuation from Xerox,” Morningstar analyst Mark Cash said.   Shares of Xerox were down marginally at $36.24 while HP was up 0.8% to $22.10. ","{'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.93, 'pos': 0.047, 'compound': 0.6187}",0.6187
Xerox to nominate as many as 11 directors to HP's board in takeover push: Wall Street Journal,Jan 22 2020,"(Reuters) - Xerox Holdings Corp () is preparing to nominate as many as 11 directors to HP Inc’s () board, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, as the company seeks to push its $33.5 billion takeover offer for the personal computer maker. The U.S.-based printer maker bought a small stake in HP in recent weeks, the newspaper reported, citing sources. The stake would give Xerox the right to nominate directors for elections to be held at the HP’s annual meeting this summer, the report said, adding that the deadline to nominate directors is Friday, and Xerox could still decide to not follow through with the nominations. In November last year, Xerox made the $33.5 billion cash-and-stock offer to HP, a company more than three times its size. HP had rejected Xerox’s offer, saying it significantly undervalued the company. Activist investor Carl Icahn, who has a 4.2% stake in HP and a 10.9% stake in Xerox, in December urged HP shareholders who agreed with a merger to reach out to the PC maker’s directors for immediate action. Earlier this month, Xerox said it secured $24 billion in financing for the proposal. HP, however, rebuffed the talks again and said securing financing is not a basis for a discussion and reiterated that the proposal still undervalues the company. Both companies did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment after regular business hours. ","{'neg': 0.014, 'neu': 0.95, 'pos': 0.036, 'compound': 0.4404}",0.4404
Zimbabwe says grain stocks running out after drought,Jan 23 2020,"HARARE, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Zimbabwe has only 100,000 tonnes of grain in its strategic reserves, enough to last just over a month, as the southern African nation suffers the effects of a severe drought, according to the agriculture minister. More than half the country’s population faces food shortages after maize harvests halved last year. The country has received little rain since the summer planting season started in November, and crops are wilting in some areas. Agriculture minister Perrance Shiri told officials in Bulawayo, southwest Zimbabwe, on Wednesday that the government should help farmers cope with drought by building more irrigation infrastructure. “As things stand at the current moment, we have less than 100,000 (metric tonnes) of grain in the strategic grain reserve and imports, especially of food, are ballooning,” he said in a speech seen by Reuters. The grain reserve has capacity to hold 500,000 tonnes but it has been run down after a poor harvest. Zimbabwe consumes 80,000 tonnes of maize every month. Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube has said Zimbabwe needs to import at least 800,000 tonnes of maize this year, mainly from Tanzania, South Africa and South America. The country’s grain millers group says it has bought 100,000 tonnes of maize from South Africa and Brazil and expects the first consignment to arrive next week. Shops are running out of subsidised maize meal while prices of basic goods soar. Zimbabwe is in the midst of its worst economic crisis in a decade, dashing hopes for a quick recovery under President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government. The United Nations World Food Programme needs $200 million to feed 4.1 million Zimbabweans after saying the country faced another poor harvest this year because of sparse rains.

"'It's the pension, stupid!' Retirement row ignites Irish election",Jan 23 2020,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Longstanding plans to increase Ireland’s statutory retirement age and the knock-on effects on pension payments have become an unexpected issue ahead of the Feb. 8 election, putting the government on the back foot. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar called the election last week, but a pitch putting his diplomatic successes on Brexit at the center of the campaign has fallen flat with an electorate more concerned about deficits in housing and healthcare. The issue of pensions has dominated the campaign in recent days amid anger from some private sector workers over being forced to retire at 65 but having to sign up for unemployment benefit until their state pension kicks in aged 66. Similar to other countries, Ireland raised the retirement age to 66 in 2014 but it is the long laid-out plan to raise it again to 67 from next year that has exercised older voters. The threshold is due to increase again to 68 in 2028. “It’s the pension, stupid. That’s what’s going to win the election,” Eugene, a 65-year-old caller to national broadcaster RTE’s Liveline phone-in talk show, said on Wednesday.  He was referring to Bill Clinton’s successful 1992 U.S. presidential slogan: “It’s the economy, stupid!”    “It’s a bridge too far (moving the age to 67), and they thought they’d get away with it.”   The pension age has dominated Liveline, the second most listened-to radio program in the country, in recent days. Sinn Fein, Ireland’s third largest party which an opinion poll on Monday put just two points behind Varadkar’s Fine Gael and four shy of the main opposition Fianna Fail, may have struck a chord with voters by calling for the retirement age to be brought back to 65. While the two larger parties refuse to govern with Sinn Fein - the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), a potential government partner, the smaller Labour Party, also wants the qualifying age to return to 65. The debate has resulted in Fine Gael and Fianna Fail committing to introduce a transition payment equivalent to the contributory state pension so that workers retiring at 65 do not need to claim unemployment benefit to make up the difference.  Fianna Fail, currently leading in the polls, has also said it will review the qualifying age if elected.  “It has to be acknowledged that this is a very significant issue at the doorsteps,” Fianna Fail finance spokesman Michael McGrath, the favorite to become Ireland’s next finance minister, told a news conference on Wednesday.

'No dollars today': Exchanges resist Lebanon's push to steady currency,Jan 22 2020,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - A push by Lebanon to rein in a thriving parallel market for dollars and halt the slide of its slumping pound hit a snag on Wednesday when currency dealers largely refused to sell at a new, lower price agreed with the central bank. Lebanon is in the throes of a deep economic crisis that has prompted banks fearing capital flight to put stiff controls on dollars, forcing everyone from major importers to average Lebanese to turn to exchange bureaus to meet their needs. Since mass protests against the country’s elite erupted in October, the dollar price on this parallel market has soared, hitting as high as 2,500 pounds to the dollar versus an official rate of 1,507.5 in place since 1997, hiking prices. Lebanon is hoping a new government formed on Tuesday will restore confidence to secure urgently needed foreign funds and  stabilize its currency and banks. Looking to stem the currency’s fall, Lebanon’s union of exchange dealers said shortly before the cabinet was announced that it agreed with the central bank to set a maximum buying price of 2,000 Lebanese pounds to the dollar. It said violators would be subject to unspecified “legal and administrative” penalties. On Wednesday, dollars once easily attained at Beirut’s buzzing exchanges were elusive, potentially posing a new challenge for Lebanese hit by the worst financial strains since a 1975-1990 civil war. Eight of 10 currency bureaus visited by Reuters said they did not have dollars for sale but were willing to purchase dollars at the new price of 2,000 Lebanese pounds. Several customers were seen selling dollars at the new rate. Other dealers said the price control would force the market underground, pushing transactions outside exchange bureaus. “It is going to create a third market, a parallel market to the parallel market. It is not very realistic,” said a second dealer. While two bureaus in Beirut’s Hamra district were selling small quantities of dollars to customers at rates of 2,050 and 2,075, while buying at 2,000, five others were turning customers away with a terse: “No dollars today.” Some dealers said the snap decision to impose a price ceiling meant the dollars they purchased a day earlier at a higher rate of 2,170-2,180 pounds would leave them with losses. “No one is selling today because we are trying to gather dollars at 2,000 to sell them,” said one dealer. “The price has to come down before we can sell at around 2,000,” he said. New finance minister Ghazi Wazni threw cold water on hopes the pound could return to pre-crisis levels, telling local broadcaster LBC “it is impossible for the dollar to return to what it was before” on the parallel market. Central bank governor Riad Salameh has insisted import-dependent Lebanon will stick by the peg, citing the need to keep in check the price of staple goods like fuel.

Planning your finances for future generations,Jan 22 2020,"Many parents envision a fulfilling life for their children. In order to provide the best they can, they seek to transfer their wealth down to their children, so that they will have sufficient funds to live comfortably. Breadwinners also need to plan for their families in the event that something unfortunate happens to them. If they do not have any financial plans in place to ensure that their loved ones are protected against unforeseen circumstances, the sudden loss of the breadwinner may impact the family’s financial well-being, resulting in them having little funds to pay for items such as their children’s education, or to maintain the lifestyle that they are used to. There are many options available for those who want to secure the future of their loved ones. While whole life insurance policies are a common option, let’s also take a look at a product with more flexible options and the opportunity to reap positive returns in a well-performing market. An investment-linked policy comprises an investment component and an insurance component, both of which have varying proportions depending on how the policy is structured. ILPs typically offer insurance benefits, such as the death benefit, which pays out a lump sum upon the passing of the life assured. The common factor among all ILPs is that, as the policyholder, you get to choose which ILP sub-funds to invest in, subject to your risk profile, as part of the ILP’s investment component. These ILP sub-funds cover a range of asset classes, from fixed income, money market funds to equity. Returns, however, are not guaranteed. Some ILPs offer partial withdrawals and bonuses, the latter of which boost overall returns in the long run. In summary, an ILP takes on more investment risks than a standalone insurance product. But when it comes to planning your family’s finances, the ILP with a life replacement option (LRO) can ensure a seamless transfer of your policy to your loved ones. The goal of an LRO is to extend the policy beyond the life of the original life assured. It ensures that the policy provides for your loved ones, by enabling the original policyholder to transfer the policy to somebody else. If the LRO is exercised, the policy does not cease upon the original life assured’s death. Instead of claiming a death benefit, which is a one-time lump sum payout, your family can continue to tap on the policy’s returns. Sometimes, parents need funds to pay for certain milestone events, such as their child's first semester at university. They can choose to make partial withdrawals on their policy in order to do so. There are two parts to transfer one's policy: the first part involves the naming of a new life assured by the original policyholder; and the second part, assigning a new policyholder, so that the policy can be transferred. The first part is straightforward: The new life assured needs to be the original policyholder’s spouse or child. The child must be below the age of 18. So upon exercise of the LRO, his or her spouse or child will be the new insured party. The next part explains the transfer of the policy to a new policyholder. In this process, the original policyholder assigns an individual who has an insurable interest on the life assured, to be the replacement policyholder. In most cases, they nominate their spouse. After the assignment of the policy, the new policyholder will maintain the policy by continuing to pay its premiums. By nominating a new policyholder, the family can continue to reap the investment returns of the ILP after the passing of the original policyholder. Do take note that the LRO can only be exercised when the policyholder is still alive. AWA is an ILP that offers the option to transfer your policy to a chosen member of your family, with a product feature called Life Replacement Option (LRO). AWA offers two free partial withdrawals, after three to five years, depending on the policy’s minimum investment period (MIP). How does LRO work — an illustration: Mark is aged 30 and a non-smoker. He is married and has a son called Leo. He purchases AWA to build a nest egg and to live a fulfilling life after retirement with his wife, Joan. As the policyholder and life assured, Mark chooses an MIP of 20 years and contributes an annual premium of $12,000. The AWA’s illustrated investment returns typically range from 4 to 8 per cent. At age 39, Mark is diagnosed with colon cancer. He can choose to exercise the LRO to change the new Life Assured to his son Leo. At the same time, he nominates his wife Joan to take over as the replacement policyholder. Under the change, Leo’s life is insured, and Joan continues to pay the premiums till the end of the MIP. At the end of the MIP of 20 years, Mark’s total account value is estimated to be worth $444,981, based on an 8 per cent illustrated investment return; or $288,878, based on a 4 per cent illustrated investment return. As a result of Mark exercising the LRO, Joan now has access to a potential accumulated nest egg. She is also able to make regular withdrawals after the end of the MIP to supplement her retirement income. If Mark does not exercise the LRO and passes away at age 40, the death benefit will be paid out and the policy will terminate. Mark’s family will not be able to enjoy further wealth accumulation. The death benefit will only come up to $194,403 based on an 8 per cent illustrated return, or just $155,932 based on a 4 per cent illustrated return. Mark names Leo as the Life Assured, which also protects Leo through to the family’s second generation. So if Leo suffers a terminal illness or passes on, Mark can rest easy knowing that Leo is protected. Planning one’s finances is a must for everyone. This is more apparent for parents, who need to ensure that their loved ones are well-protected. But it is never too late to think about your family’s financial needs. With its flexibility in switching sub-funds, the opportunity to make withdrawals, and an option to transfer a policy to another member of the family, an ILP could assist you in reaching your family’s financial goals.

Business Briefs : Bank of Japan,Jan 21 2020,"The Bank of Japan (BOJ) left rates unchanged yesterday and painted a brighter picture of the economic outlook, offering a further indication that the likelihood of additional stimulus has receded. The central bank maintained its targets for interest rates and asset purchases, an outcome forecast by all 42 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The BOJ also raised its growth projections for the first time in a year, as had been widely expected, thanks to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's US$120 billion (S$162 billion) economic package unveiled last month. BLOOMBERG Uber Technologies has agreed to sell Uber Eats in India to local rival Zomato, underscoring the US ride-hailing giant's effort to cut back on loss-making operations globally. Uber will offload the business in return for 9.9 per cent of the Indian start-up, maintaining a foothold in one of the world's fastest-growing Internet arenas, the New York Times reported. Zomato confirmed the sale in a blog post yesterday but did not specify details. Uber, which is trading well below its initial public offering price, seeks to hive off loss-making operations to achieve its goal of being profitable on an Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) basis by 2021. BLOOMBERG Discussions with a financier who was planning to extend at least US$180 million (S$243 million) in new debt to Pacific Radiance have come to a halt. The mainboard-listed offshore marine services firm, which is coming up with a debt restructuring plan, on Monday evening said the talks have ""stalled"" due to ""certain difficulties"" which arose in the course of discussions around December last year. The debt funding as well as new equity via a share placement were meant to finance Pacific Radiance's proposed US$180 million acquisition of Abu Dhabi-based Allianz Marine and Logistics Services and to repay the group's existing debts by way of schemes of arrangement. If the new debt funding had come through, the group would have proposed schemes that included a cash payment of about US$175.6 million to discharge the group's bank debt. Pacific Radiance on Monday said it has approached other potential financiers who had submitted indicative proposals to the company last year.","{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.846, 'pos': 0.099, 'compound': 0.9221}",0.9221
ComfortDelGro gets $23m green loan to buy hybrid buses for Australia fleet,Jan 21 2020,"SINGAPORE (THE BUSINESS TIMES) - ComfortDelGro'S Australian subsidiary has secured a A$25 million (S$23.1 million) green loan from OCBC Bank to finance its hybrid bus fleet in Victoria, the transport giant announced in a media statement on Tuesday (Jan 21). The loan was structured according to the green loan principles issued in 2018 by the Loan Market Association and Asia Pacific Loan Market Association. Proceeds from the green loan will be used to purchase 50 hybrid buses. Delivery of these environmentally friendly buses has begun, with the last batch of buses expected in mid-2022, ComfortDelGro said. These low-floor buses will feature Volvo's parallel hybrid driveline and meet Euro VI emission standards. According to ComfortDelGro, tests have shown that the Volvo hybrid driveline reduces nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions by up to 50 per cent, and lowers fuel consumption by up to 39 per cent in mixed traffic. The company added that the hybrid buses use 30 per cent less fuel and make significantly less noise when idling at, and departing from stops. Yang Ban Seng, managing director and group CEO of ComfortDelGro noted that sustainability considerations are at the core of the group's business strategy, and that the green loan is another milestone following the group's inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index last September. Separately, the loan also expands OCBC Bank's sustainable finance portfolio to the transportation sector, and is in line with the lender's goal of building a $10 billion sustainable finance portfolio by 2022. Elaine Lam, head of global corporate banking at OCBC Bank, noted that investment in low carbon public transportation is critical to developing sustainable cities. ""We hope this green loan sends a positive message to encourage peer industry players to take steps to support sustainable urban development through green financing options,"" Ms Lam added. As at 10.02am on Tuesday, ComfortDelGro shares were trading at $2.23, down two cents, or 0.9 per cent. ","{'neg': 0.033, 'neu': 0.901, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': 0.8979}",0.8979
"Macron, Trump may have tariff truce in 2020 digital tax fight",Jan 21 2020,"PARIS (BLOOMBERG) - Presidents Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump agreed to a truce in their dispute over digital taxes that will mean neither France nor the US will impose punitive tariffs this year, a French diplomat said. ""Great discussion with @realDonaldTrump on digital tax,"" Mr Macron said Monday (Jan 20) in a tweet. ""We will work together on a good agreement to avoid tariff escalation."" Mr Trump, on Twitter, responded ""excellent!"" to Mr Macron's post, without providing any more details. Mr Trump is en route to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum (WEF). A White House readout of the call was notably more muted, saying only that the ""two leaders agreed it is important to complete successful negotiations on the digital services tax"" and ""discussed other bilateral issues."" And neither a White House spokesman nor officials with the US Trade Representative's office would confirm that the US president had called off his announced tariffs. Still, the possible respite may defuse transatlantic tensions that had been building between Washington and Brussels along another potential trade war front. Last week,   aimed at balancing trade between the world's two largest economies. The European Union is an even bigger US trading partner than China and supply chains between the two economies, particularly in automotive and financial services industries, are intertwined in ways that would make a tit-for-tat tariff dispute even more harmful to the world economy. France and the US will continue negotiations along with their European partners until the end of 2020 to agree a global framework that ensures tech companies pay an appropriate amount of tax, the French diplomat said. Mr Macron's government still hopes to find a solution that fits within discussions at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) work on the issue, the official added, asking not to be identified in line with French government rules. European finance ministers meeting in Brussels Tuesday will discuss progress of the OECD talks. While the OECD is still working on its proposal for taxing tech companies around the world, France pushed ahead with its own levy last year that hit US Internet giants like Google, Apple and Amazon.com. The US objected, alleging on Dec 2 that the French tax discriminates against American technology companies, citing Section 301 of a 1974 American law that Mr Trump has thus far reserved to justify tariffs against China. That opened the door to the US' threat to hit US$2.4 billion (S$3.23 billion) of French goods with tariffs in retaliation. Among the French products targeted with duties of as much as 100 per cent were luxury items like wine, cheese and makeup. One American wine merchant called it the biggest threat to the industry since Prohibition a century ago. For its part, the French government had warned that the EU would retaliate if the US imposed additional tariffs. The dispute was another headache for European trade officials scrambling to expand their policy arsenal as the US takes aim at a rules-based system for global trade that Mr Trump argues is outdated and tilted against America. It also coincided with a change in leadership at the European Commission, the EU's executive arm. EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan visited Washington last week for the first time in the job, partly to plead for talks rather than tariffs in disagreements like the French digital tax. At stake, he said, was transatlantic trade in goods and services valued at more than US$3 billion a day. ""Sounds like a fairly healthy relationship to me,"" Mr Hogan said Thursday in the US capital. ""So why put tariffs on these EU products to make them more expensive for your people?"" The truce follows weeks of discussions between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who were scheduled to meet Wednesday in Davos, Switzerland, the alpine resort town where government officials and business leaders gather during the winter to discuss whatever is ailing the global economy. US and EU trade relations started to sour in 2018 when the Trump administration invoked national-security considerations to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum from Europe. As a US military ally, the EU was infuriated and promptly retaliated with levies on iconic American brands such as Harley-Davidson motorcycles and Levi Strauss jeans. A subsequent US threat to wreak significantly more economic damage by targeting the European auto industry with duties on the same security grounds led to a hastily agreed truce and a pledge by both sides to work toward reducing industrial tariffs across the board. Since then, the Trump administration has refused to start the tariff-cutting negotiations unless Europe includes agriculture in them. Also, it imposed levies on EU products in retaliation over government aid to Airbus SE that was deemed illegal by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and disabled the WTO's appellate body. The EU, meanwhile, is pressing ahead with a plan for tariffs against the US in a parallel WTO case over unlawful subsidies to Boeing Co. Mr Trump, scheduled to speak Tuesday in Davos at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting, on Sunday reiterated his frustration with Europe as a trading partner.","{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.87, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': -0.8545}",-0.8545
World Economic Forum: Pact on Singapore-pioneered framework to foster trust in trade digitalisation,Jan 22 2020,"The adoption of digital technologies in trade and commerce has taken another step forward with the signing of a landmark agreement yesterday.Ovais Subhani The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and 17 major companies from key industries have agreed to develop TradeTrust - a framework to shift world trade from a paper-based system to a digitally enabled one. Pioneered by Singapore, the framework establishes the fundamentals to foster trust in the digitalisation of trade while making sure new rules work in conjunction with the multilateral trading system. The initiative aims to cut back on the reams of paper needed when goods are transported from one part of the world to another. The paper trail invariably makes logistics a slow, inefficient and complex process. ""We believe we must forge new ways to enable trade in the digital era,"" Minister for Communications and Information S. Iswaran said at the Taking Trade Digital session in Davos, Switzerland. Yesterday's event occurred on the sidelines of the 50th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. Mr Iswaran said the TradeTrust initiative is part of Singapore's broader efforts to digitalise trade while establishing clear and harmonised international rules that allow data to flow freely between countries with appropriate safeguards. Those efforts include the substantial conclusion of the first Digital Economy Agreement with Chile and New Zealand announced on Tuesday and ongoing talks with Australia and other countries on similar pacts, he said. Singapore is also the co-convener of the World Trade Organisation initiative to develop baseline digital trade rules. The TradeTrust framework will provide a range of features, including ways to validate digital trade documents, an accreditation structure to certify technical solutions and open source codes that can easily integrate back-end solutions to the TradeTrust network. One of the first platforms built on the TradeTrust framework is the ICC TradeFlow - co-developed by the ICC with trade technology firm Perlin, and in collaboration with Singapore's Infocomm Media Development Authority, commodities trader Trafigura and DBS Bank. The ICC's 45 million members worldwide could be among the first to conduct trade more efficiently while still managing risks and having legal certainty and confidence in the trading process, Mr Iswaran said. He noted that a pilot TradeTrust transaction involving an iron ore shipment reduced documentation time from 45 to 20 days. ICC secretary-general John Denton said: ""Digital platforms will lower existing barriers to inter-national trade in the coming years and enable many more businesses to participate in the new global economy."" DBS chief executive Piyush Gupta said trade and trade finance continue to be the most onerous of business processes. ""Digital technologies, especially distributed ledger, are well geared to solve this, but this requires coordination from key players on a global scale,"" he noted. ""DBS is excited to be part of this fresh effort to leverage digital technologies to create efficiency for our clients and for the global trading system.""

"UPDATE 2-Almirall lowers earnings forecast, fearing Spanish drug price moves",Feb 24 2020,"(Updates with CFO quotes, share price) BARCELONA, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Almirall cut its earnings outlook on Monday, sending shares in the Spanish drugs group to their lowest level in more than 18 months, citing the impact of potential government measures in Spain and new competition in the United States. Although no measures have been announced, Almirall’s finance chief Mike McClellan told Reuters there was a risk that Spain’s new leftist coalition would seek to cut the pharmaceutical product prices or accelerate their substitution with generic ones. In the United States, the approval since January of a generic competitor to Almirall’s anti-acne product Aczone could also dent its sales growth, he added. Shares in Barcelona-based Almirall fell 9% after it reported a 36% increase in net profit for 2019 to 106 million euros ($115 million) on higher sales, but said it expected its sales growth to slow down and EBITDA to drop by more than forecast this year. At 1443 GMT the shares were down 5.2% at 12 euros. Almirall said net sales would grow in low to mid single-digit terms in 2020 compared to a 12.7% rise to 853 million euros last year. This was below consensus expectations of 12% revenue growth, Credit Suisse Capital Markets said. CM Capital Markets said the net profit was well below consensus estimates, as well as the guidance for 2020. Almirall, which reported a 45% jump in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) last year to 304 million euros, also said that in 2020 EBITDA would drop to between 260 and 280 million euros. “But we expect the underlying core business to actually grow in 2020,” McClellan said.

Argentina's talks with IMF moving 'in the right direction': Mnuchin,Feb 24 2020,"RIYADH (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday welcomed Argentina’s talks with the International Monetary Fund after the heavily indebted Latin American country said it would launch consultations that could lead to a new funding program. Mnuchin told Reuters that he had a productive meeting with Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman on the sidelines of a meeting of finance officials from the world’s 20 largest economies (G20) in Riyadh. IMF officials also briefed G20 finance ministers and central bankers about the situation in Argentina, whose debt situation the IMF last week described as “unsustainable”. “There are many issues that still need to be addressed,” Mnuchin said in an interview. “The conversations that they’re having with the IMF are preliminary but are moving in the right direction.”   Guzman’s minister said the meeting between the two officials last about half an hour. Guzman, in a post on Twitter, also used the word “productive” to describe the meeting with Mnuchin. The Argentine minister on Saturday said Argentina would initiate Article IV consultations with the IMF that could pave the way for an IMF program - a move experts say will reassure bondholders that Argentina remains under IMF supervision.  The country, which has defaulted on debt obligations eight times so far, is facing tough negotiations with creditors and the IMF to restructure around $100 billion in debt that the Argentine government says it cannot pay unless given time to revive stalled economic growth. The IMF gave Argentina a $57 billion standby financing agreement in 2018, but that program was agreed by the previous government and has been essentially on ice since the election.

"BOJ's Kuroda blames yen's fall on strong dollar, upbeat on economy",Feb 22 2020,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Saturday the yen’s recent declines were largely driven by a strong dollar, shrugging off some market views that the widening coronavirus epidemic is triggering an outflow of funds from Asia. Kuroda also said he had not changed his view that Japan’s economy would continue to recover moderately, suggesting that he saw no immediate need for the BOJ to expand stimulus. “If needed, we will take additional monetary easing steps without hesitation,” he told reporters upon arriving at a Group of 20 finance leaders’ gathering in Riyadh. “But the situation is still uncertain. I don’t think our scenario projecting a moderate economic recovery has been derailed.” The fallout from the coronavirus crisis has overshadowed the meeting of the world’s top economies kicking off on Saturday. Business disruptions in China are starting to spill over into the global economy, with parts shortages rippling through supply chains as far away as the United States. The yen bounced back on Friday after suffering its worst two-day performance since 2017 on worries about the health of Japan’s economy, which has been hit by supply-chain disruptions and a plunge in Chinese tourists caused by the virus outbreak. Kuroda dismissed views held by some market players that the yen could be losing its status as a safe-haven currency. “When you look at recent developments, the dollar is strengthening against the yen, the euro and various currencies including those in Asia,” Kuroda said. “It’s true there is uncertainty over the coronavirus outbreak’s impact on the Chinese, Asian and global economies. But I don’t think there has been a fundamental change in the exchange-rate market.” Japan’s economy shrank at its fastest pace in nearly six years in the December quarter, as soft global demand for Japanese cars and machinery and last year’s sales tax hike hurt domestic consumption and business spending. Some analysts expect the economy to contract again in the current quarter, dashing the BOJ’s hope that an expected rebound in global growth in the middle of the year will underpin Japan’s fragile recovery. Kuroda brushed aside voices of pessimism, saying that corporate capital expenditure remained firm and rising household income was underpinning domestic consumption of an array of goods and services. Temporary factors that led to the October-December economic contraction, such as damage from a string of typhoons and the sales tax hike, will fade later this year, he said. While the coronavirus outbreak was a fresh risk, other uncertainties that dragged on growth like the Sino-U.S. trade tensions and Brexit were subsiding, Kuroda added. “I don’t expect Japan’s economy to suffer a severe downturn,” he said. Under a policy dubbed yield curve control, the BOJ caps long-term borrowing costs around zero to spur growth and achieve its elusive 2% inflation target. Many BOJ policymakers are wary of ramping up stimulus unless the economy is hit by a severe shock due to their dwindling ammunition and the rising cost of prolonged easing such as the hit to commercial banks’ profits from ultra-low interest rates.

Breakingviews - Cox: Anyone on Wall Street want a Swiss bank?,Feb 24 2020,"ZURICH (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ever since Goldman Sachs chieftain David Solomon signalled his interest in expanding further into consumer financial services, many investors have speculated the Wall Street firm will want to buy an American bank like U.S. Bancorp or PNC Financial Services. But imagine if the target of Goldman’s affections were to reside someplace entirely different – like in Switzerland.     A transatlantic banking deal probably sounds like the stuff of regulators’ nightmares. As the conventional wisdom would have it, no watchdog in Washington, Frankfurt or Bern wants to see big banks get bigger, more complicated or harder to oversee. Blending a Wall Street behemoth with a Swiss juggernaut is, therefore, hard to contemplate.     But by partnering with one of Zurich’s banking beauties, Goldman – or rivals including Morgan Stanley or Bank of America - would have a better-balanced business that is arguably safer and less dependent on risky trading. It’s basically the argument that has propelled Morgan Stanley Chairman and Chief Executive James Gorman to bulk up on wealth management, culminating in the $13 billion purchase of E*Trade he announced on Thursday.     That strategy explains why Morgan Stanley commands more market respect than its traditional nemesis. As Gorman has reduced the share of the firm’s revenue from securities trading, investors have been willing to attach a higher valuation to its shares. They now trade at 1.14 times historical book value per share, compared to about 1.06 times for Goldman. By contrast, JPMorgan, the U.S. bank that has pulled ahead of all its peers since bulking up during the financial crisis, is worth 1.8 times its book value.     But shareholders aren’t the only ones who might benefit from a Swiss-American combo. A deal could be structured in a way that would allow Swiss regulators to sleep more comfortably at night. True, UBS and Credit Suisse appear unlikely merger partners right now. Both just named new CEOs: Ralph Hamers of ING will take over from UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti in September, and Thomas Gottstein replaced Tidjane Thiam at Credit Suisse earlier this month. The new executives and their boards won’t be looking to entertain suitors. But their rivals across the Atlantic will be watching closely for any sign of a slip up.  UBS and Credit Suisse both have a domestic financial institution serving Swiss consumers and companies; an asset management arm; a global investment bank and a wealth management business catering to the world’s richest people. An American merger partner would be most interested in this last business.    UBS, with a market value of about $50 billion, is the most alluring of the two. It had a balance sheet of $972 billion at the end of 2019, with $259 billion of risk-weighted assets against which it holds $36 billion of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Credit Suisse, whose market capitalisation is around $35 billion, has a balance sheet of 787 billion Swiss francs ($800 billion), with 290 billion Swiss francs of risk-weighted assets – reflecting the relative importance of the riskier and more asset-intensive investment banking business - and 39 billion Swiss francs of tangible equity.     The Federal Reserve, which oversees Goldman and Morgan Stanley, would probably blanch at the prospect of either bank expanding their balance sheets by nearly $1 trillion. And even if it blessed such a union, the resulting combo would probably face a capital surcharge because its size makes it even more “too big to fail”. But there are a few ways around this.     First, Credit Suisse and UBS could spin off their domestic banks directly to shareholders. That would both reduce the cost of a takeover and reduce risk. Moreover, untethering lenders serving Swiss retail and business customers from a parent involved in trickier global operations might appeal to the Financial Market Supervisory Authority and the Swiss National Bank, which are charged with monitoring the safety and soundness of the country’s banking system.     Credit Suisse flagged the idea back in 2016, when it considered an initial public offering of a 30% stake in its Swiss bank to raise capital. The division was then run by Gottstein, now the group’s CEO. It accounts for about 78 billion Swiss francs of risk-weighted assets, some 27% of the total. At 10 times its 2019 operating profit, adjusted for one-time gains, the bank is probably worth more than 20 billion Swiss francs on its own.     The equivalent business at UBS has $67 billion of risk-weighted assets, accounting for about a quarter of the total, and made about $1.5 billion of operating income. It might be worth $15 billion. When Credit Suisse contemplated spinning off its Swiss bank, regulators wanted it to hold CET1 equal to 10% of risk-weighted assets - significantly less than the 12.7% ratio reported by the group at the end of last year. That means a spinoff could free up money for the parent. Enough, though, about what a suitor wouldn’t keep. The prize for Goldman or Morgan Stanley would be the private wealth management business. UBS oversees $2.9 trillion of client assets, through 10,000 advisers, about half of them in the United States. The $3.5 billion of operating profit the business generated last year accounted for about 63% of the bank’s bottom line. Contrast that with Goldman’s wealth management division, which has about a fifth the assets, and accounted for 12% of its parent’s 2019 net revenue. Absorbing its Swiss rival would reduce Goldman’s dependency on riskier, less predictable, activities like global markets or investment banking, which last year brought in 40% and 20% of net revenue, respectively. A deal would boost Goldman in an area where it lags Morgan Stanley, especially once the latter completes its purchase of E*Trade; and Bank of America, which bought Merrill Lynch during the financial crisis. UBS established itself as serving wealthy Americans with the $10.8 billion purchase of PaineWebber 20 years ago. As established U.S. wealth managers, Morgan Stanley and BofA would be in a better position to squeeze costs out of a merger with UBS. Combining two of the three largest U.S. wealth management businesses wouldn’t be pretty and could lead to the loss of both clients and relationship managers. But slicing 10% from the Swiss bank’s operating expenses in wealth management would free up some $1.3 billion a year. That alone could justify paying a premium of nearly $10 billion to UBS shareholders, before accounting for other potential synergies. UBS also has a $900 billion asset management division which made $532 million before taxes last year. For Goldman, that would boost its investment arm by nearly two-thirds to around $2.2 trillion. Morgan Stanley’s investment management unit ended the year with $552 billion under management and $447 million of pre-tax income. That’s not far off from Credit Suisse, which had 438 billion Swiss francs of assets under its wing, generating pre-tax profit of 473 million Swiss francs. The last big piece of the puzzle, investment banking, is where things get knotty. Combinations in the sector almost never meet expectations, largely because the best employees leave and customers often do less business with the larger entity to reduce counterparty and concentration risk. That was the case, for instance, with Credit Suisse’s purchase of American securities firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette back in 2000. But what if the goal was not to expand market share but rather to reduce the amount of capital tied up in the U.S. arms of the two Swiss banks?     There would still be some benefits to Goldman or another investment bank from going Swiss. Credit Suisse came in seventh globally in the league table rankings compiled by Refinitiv for advising on mergers and acquisitions, syndicating loans and underwriting stock and bond deals last year. UBS came in 14th. Credit Suisse has some expertise in areas a Wall Street partner might covet, such as structured products and leveraged finance. UBS would bring depth in Asia, where it ranked 9th, just ahead of Goldman, last year. It has also launched a joint venture with Banco do Brasil that might help in Latin America. But by and large, combining investment banks would be what one executive termed “a firing squad”.     Still, as bloody as the union might be for the bankers involved, it potentially would allow for the combination to hack away at the balance sheet of the Swiss groups, particularly in the United States where the Fed requires them to hold dedicated capital against their trading businesses. In such a scenario it’s possible that a sizeable chunk, if not all, of the $15 billion in capital held by UBS Americas in June last year could be released to shareholders as the investment bank unwinds its $81 billion of risk-weighted assets.  Just because a compelling case can be made in a spreadsheet for a Swiss charm offensive, doesn’t mean it will happen. For starters, the companies have very different corporate cultures. Goldman is a former partnership founded by a Jewish émigré from Bavaria. The Swiss banks were forced to compensate Holocaust victims for dormant accounts and lost assets 20 years ago. To placate Swiss interests, moreover, any acquirer would probably need to commit to making Zurich a global headquarters for the combined international wealth and asset management businesses.       Another risk is that the billionaire customers of Swiss banks in Asia and beyond might not take kindly to having their assets managed by an American institution. Though changes to bank secrecy laws no longer give Switzerland the same edge as in years past, there is arguably a halo effect to the idea of entrusting money to a bank headquartered in neutral Switzerland, especially as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has aggressively used financial sanctions as an instrument of U.S. foreign policy.       Those considerations could merit selling some of the international wealth operations to another bank, such as HSBC or Banco Santander. Similarly, a U.S. owner might want to offload the Swiss private banking business, as Morgan Stanley did for compliance reasons in 2014.     Finally, there’s the question of whether the Fed would let an American bank get so adventurous, even if it could make a case that a deal reduced market risk without measurably expanding its balance sheet. Goldman has yet to agree a settlement with regulatory and judicial authorities in Washington, Malaysia and elsewhere over the multibillion 1MDB sovereign wealth fund fraud. Even when it does close that chapter, the Fed could still decide to tie Goldman’s hands on doing a big deal for years to come.     For now, the prospect of a Wall Street expedition to the Alps may seem remote. But as the new brooms at UBS and Credit Suisse confront the harsh realities of their businesses, and identify their strengths, the logic may become clearer to them.

Britain considers looser fiscal rules for March 11 budget: Sunday Times,Feb 23 2020,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is considering relaxing rules on public spending at an upcoming budget on March 11, the Sunday Times reported citing unnamed sources. Finance minister Rishi Sunak, appointed earlier this month after his predecessor Sajid Javid resigned unexpectedly, will deliver his first budget on March 11. The Sunday Times said Sunak was considering giving himself an extra two years to balance day-to-day spending, extending the current three year target to reach a balanced budget to five years, allowing himself higher spending in the near term. The newspaper also said that Sunak’s predecessor had been asked to change the rules to allow 1% leeway on balancing the budget. The Treasury did not immediately comment on the report. If implemented next month, both measures would allow higher spending - something markets have expected since Sunak’s appointment. The 39-year old took the position when Javid resigned because he was not prepared to sack his advisers and cede some power of financial policy to Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s office. Johnson advocated the need for higher spending on public services as central part of his successful election campaign last year. His campaign also set out three fiscal rules, which were already looser than the existing ones used by previous Conservative governments.  Under those rules, day-to-day spending would not be funded by borrowing within three years’ time, public sector net investment would not average more than 3% of GDP, and spending would be reviewed if debt interest payments reach 6% of revenue. The government has not yet confirmed whether it remains committed to those rules, only saying that the budget would provide a clear fiscal framework for public spending.

China's central bank vows to take more steps to support virus-hit economy,Feb 22 2020,"SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s central bank will take further steps to support the virus-hit economy, including releasing more liquidity and lowering funding costs for companies, a vice governor of the bank told state media. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will guide market interest rates lower, Liu Guoqiang, the bank official, told the Financial News in an interview. “China’s monetary policy space is still very sufficient, and the toolbox is also sufficient. We are confident and able to offset the impact of the epidemic,” Liu told the newspaper. The PBOC also will release more liquidity to some banks due to annual changes in assessments of targeted reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cuts, which will free up more funds to lend to smaller firms, Liu said. The virus and widespread transportation lockdowns put in place to contain it have caused significant disruptions to economic activity in China, with smaller, private firms such as restaurants particularly vulnerable because they have less cash on hand to tide themselves through until business recovers.     “In the near future, there will be dynamic adjustments in targeted RRR reductions for inclusive financing. More qualified banks are expected to enjoy preferential policy support, as more liquidity will be released into the banking system,” Liu said. In January 2019, the central bank released about 250 billion yuan ($35.58 billion) in additional cash to banks, due to changes in assessments for banks’ targeted RRR reductions announced in 2018. The central bank will push down lending rates, especially for smaller firms, by further improving the transmission mechanism of the loan prime rate (LPR) - its new benchmark lending rate, Liu said. But Liu reiterated that the central bank will not resort to “flood-like” stimulus. China has cut several of its key rates in recent weeks, including the benchmark lending rate on Thursday, and has urged banks to give cheap loans and payment relief to companies which have been hardest hit by the outbreak. Analysts widely expect further monetary and fiscal support measures in coming weeks, while stressing the key near-term policy challenge will be finding ways to keep companies afloat until demand recovers. Benchmark deposit rates will also be adjusted at an appropriate time, Liu said. Speculation had been growing that a cut was being considered, which would lower banks’ funding costs and give them more incentive to lower rates they charge for loans. Liu said that the epidemic’s impact on China’s economy would be limited, and that Beijing would strive to meet economic and social development targets this year.  Chen Yulu, another vice central bank governor, said the country is fully confident it beat the epidemic, state media reported on Saturday. “We believe that after this epidemic is over, pent-up demand for consumption and investment will be fully released, and China’s economy will rebound swiftly,” Chen said. China’s economic growth may show a sharp slowdown in the first quarter, probably dipping to 3% or even lower from 6% in the previous quarter - which was the weakest pace in nearly 30 years, economists estimated. Some forecasters also say there is a growing risk the economy could contract in the first quarter from the previous three months, as factories have been slower to resume production than expected due to shortages of staff and raw materials. The central bank also is closely monitoring consumer prices, which could be disturbed by the virus epidemic, Liu said. Seasonal factors and the virus’ impact were behind the flat M1 money supply, or cash in circulation plus corporate demand deposits, in January from a year earlier, Liu said. Liu also said China’s economic fundamentals were sound, adding it had ample foreign currency reserves to support its yuan currency.

China's local government finances to suffer 'interim' impact due to virus,Feb 24 2020,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s local governments will suffer an “interim impact” on fiscal revenue and expenditure from the virus epidemic that the country has so far allocated 99.5 billion yuan ($14.16 billion) to fight, a finance ministry official said on Monday. The central government will increase the amount and speed of transfer payments to local governments to help alleviate the pressure, Assistant Finance Minister Ou Wenhan told a news conference in Beijing. Policymakers have rolled out a raft of measures to support an economy jolted by the virus, which is expected to have a devastating impact on first-quarter growth. The coronavirus has infected nearly 77,000 people and killed more than 2,500 in China, most in Hubei. Chinese regional and local governments could see contractions in their 2020 revenue growth, with added pressure from healthcare spending and subsidies for virus-struck firms,  analysts from Moody’s said in a note last week.  But the regional governments “currently most affected by the outbreak have stronger financial profiles,” they said.  Local financial departments are stabilizing fiscal operations by “vigorously reducing general expenditures and doing everything possible to raise funds,” Ou said. Expenditure on virus prevention and control work should be prioritized, he said. China is expected to keep fiscal stimulus on track in the near term to stabilize growth. On Saturday, Beijing municipality announced investment projects involving 252.3 billion yuan this year, focusing on infrastructure and housing. “The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia will inevitably have a relatively big impact on the economy and society,” President Xi Jinping was quoted as saying by state media on Sunday, adding that the impact would be short-term and controllable.

Climate change gets first mention in G20 finance communique of Trump era,Feb 23 2020,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Finance officials from the world’s 20 biggest economies (G20) on Sunday referenced climate change in their final communique for the first time in U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, but stopped short of calling it a major risk to the economy. The United States blocked including climate change on a list of downside risks to global growth that had won agreement by nearly all other G20 delegates, but ultimately agreed to permit a reference to the Financial Stability Board’s work examining  the implications of climate change for financial stability. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin played down the importance of the language included, calling it a “purely factual” reference to work being done by the FSB. But several G20 sources said it marked progress toward greater recognition of the economic risks posed by climate change. “I did not bend to pressure from the Europeans,” Mnuchin told reporters after the release of the communique, bristling at the characterization of one reporter. Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan, hosting the meeting in Riyadh, told reporters that climate change remained a very important issue on the Saudi G20 presidency agenda and that there had been discussions related to “financial risks at large” linked to the issue. Discussions related to “climate change and environmental protection” would continue at ministerial meetings and in technical groups throughout the year, he said. One of the G20 sources said it was the first time a reference to climate change had been included in a G20 finance communique during Trump’s presidency, even though it was removed from the top of the joint statement. U.S. officials have resisted naming climate change as an economic risk since Trump took office in 2017. One of his first acts as president was to announce Washington’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. Delegates worked out the compromise this weekend after Washington objected to a proposal to add “macroeconomic risk related to environmental stability” to a list of downside risks to global growth, two G20 diplomatic sources said. The final version of the communique eliminated those words from the first paragraph, leaving the only mention of climate concerns in the context of the work being done by the FSB further down in the document. That passage reads: “Mobilizing sustainable finance and strengthening financial inclusion are important for global growth and stability. The FSB is examining the financial stability implications of climate change.” “We welcome private sector participation and transparency in these areas.” G20 finance ministers and central bankers met in the Saudi capital on Saturday and Sunday to discuss top global economic challenges, including the spread of coronavirus. Concerns about the economic impact of climate change have escalated in recent years and pressure is mounting on business to accelerate the shift to a low-carbon economy ahead of United Nations climate talks in November. A report issued last week forecast the world’s financial services sector risks losses of up to $1 trillion if it fails to respond quickly to climate change and is hit by policy shifts such as the introduction of a carbon tax. The International Monetary Fund included climate-related disasters in a list of risks that could derail a “highly fragile” projected recovery in the global economy in 2020.  It estimated that a typical climate-related natural disaster reduced growth by an average of 0.4 percentage points in the affected country the year it occurred.  “We should not hide away from what is going on. The climate crisis is upon us,” IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva told a conference in Riyadh on Friday ahead of the G20 talks. In a statement after the meetings ended, Georgieva called for concerted action “to scale up climate change mitigation and adaptation.” The communique forecasts a modest pick-up in global growth this year and next, but cites downside risks to this outlook stemming from geopolitical and remaining trade tensions and policy uncertainty.

"Concern over coronavirus spread as cases jump in South Korea, Italy and Iran",Feb 23 2020,"SEOUL/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - International concern about the spread of coronavirus outside China grew on Sunday with sharp rises in infections in South Korea, Italy and Iran. The government in Seoul put the country on high alert after the number of infections surged over 600 with six deaths. A focal point was a church in the southeastern city of Daegu, where a 61-year-old member of the congregation with no recent record of overseas travel tested positive for the virus. In Italy, officials said a third person infected with the flu-like virus had died, while the number of cases jumped to above 150 from just three before Friday. Authorities sealed off the worst affected towns and banned public gatherings in much of the north, including halting the carnival in Venice, where there were two cases, to try to contain the biggest outbreak in Europe. “I was surprised by this explosion of cases,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told state broadcaster RAI, warning that the numbers would likely rise in the coming days. “We will do everything we can to contain the contagion.” Italian health authorities were struggling to find out how the virus started. “If we cannot find ‘patient zero’ then it means the virus is even more ubiquitous than we thought,” said Luca Zaia, the regional governor of the wealthy Veneto region. Almost a dozen towns in Lombardy and Veneto with a combined population of some 50,000 have effectively been placed under quarantine. The European Union said it had confidence in the Italian authorities. “We share concern for possible contagion (but) there is no need to panic,” the bloc’s Economic Affairs Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni told reporters.           Iran, which announced its first two cases on Wednesday, said it had confirmed 43 cases and eight deaths, with most of the infections in the Shi’ite Muslim holy city of Qom. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Turkey and Afghanistan imposed travel and immigration restrictions on the Islamic Republic.  The virus has killed 2,442 people in China, which has reported 76,936 cases, and has slammed the brakes on the world’s second largest economy. It has spread to some 28 other countries and territories, with a death toll of around two dozen, according to a Reuters tally. “Despite the continuing decline in reported cases from China, the last two days have seen extremely concerning developments elsewhere in the world,” said Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at Britain’s University of East Anglia. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Saturday it was worried by the detection of infections without a clear link to China. For a graphic on tracking the novel coronavirus, click  China, which has seen the vast majority of cases, reported 648 new infections. But only 18 were outside of Hubei province, the lowest number outside the epicenter since authorities began publishing data a month ago and locked down large parts of the country. “At present, the epidemic situation is still severe and complex, and prevention and control work is in the most difficult and critical stage,” President Xi Jinping said. State run television urged people to avoid complacency, drawing attention to people gathering in public areas and tourist spots without wearing masks.  In South Korea, Catholic churches in Daegu and Gwangju have suspended services and other gatherings, while churches elsewhere saw declines in attendance on Sunday, especially among the elderly.  “If the situation gets worse, I think we’ll need to take more measures,” said Song Gi-young, 53, wearing a face mask at church. South Korea’s president said raising the disease alert to the highest level, allowing authorities to send extra resources to Daegu city and Cheongdo county, which were designated “special care zones” on Friday. Health officials reported 169 new infections, bringing the total to 602. The potential economic impact of the disease was prominent at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Riyadh. The International Monetary Fund’s chief said China’s 2020 growth would likely be lower at 5.6%, down 0.4 percentage points from its January outlook, with 0.1 percentage points shaved from global growth. Xi highlighted the importance of fighting the epidemic in the capital Beijing, which has recently required people arriving from elsewhere in China to be quarantined at home for 14 days. He said it would have a relatively big, but short-term impact on the economy and that Beijing would step up policy adjustments to help cushion the blow. In Japan, where the government is facing growing questions about whether it is doing enough to counter the virus, authorities had confirmed 773 cases by early Sunday evening. Most of them were from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo, the Diamond Princess. A third passenger, a Japanese man in his 80s, died on Sunday. British authorities said four people evacuated from the ship had tested positive for the virus after being flown to Britain.

"Coronavirus to drag oil below $60 this year, weighing on Gulf exporters: IIF",Feb 22 2020,"RIYADH (Reuters) - The coronavirus outbreak may curb demand for oil in China and other Asian countries, depressing oil prices further to as low as $57 a barrel and clouding growth prospects across the Middle East, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) said. “Before the coronavirus we were assuming that oil prices would average $60 a barrel this year, compared to $64 last year,” said Garbis Iradian, chief economist for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) at the finance industry body. “Most likely we’ll revise our forecast for the whole year, it could be $58 or $57 depending on developments of coronavirus.” His comments underscored growing concerns about the economic impact of the virus that will dominate the meetings of finance officials from the world’s 20 largest economies this weekend in Riyadh. Iradian said the virus outbreak could depress China’s growth by 0.5 to 0.7 percentage points. That would have a dramatic impact on crude prices, which on Friday fell to $57.75 a barrel by 1442 GMT, as a rise in new cases fueled economic uncertainty. “If the growth rate (for China) is 5% then it has major implications for oil. The Chinese demand for oil could drop by around 400,000 barrels a day, and other Asian countries could lower their demand. Overall the increase in global demand for oil, instead of being 900,000 barrels per day … could be 300,000 to 400,000,” he said. This may impact economic growth in the Middle East, though a direct impact on regional economies, particularly for oil exporters, has so far been contained, he said. A draft communique prepared for the G20 meeting on Feb. 22-23 said financial leaders of the world’s largest economies expect a modest pick up in global growth in 2020 and 2021 due to a continuation of “accommodative” financial conditions and signs of easing trade tensions. But it said the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 2,000 people and crippled the Chinese economy through drastic curbs on travel and commerce, posed a downside risk to the economic outlook.

Danish $3 billion Taiwanese wind project says financing secure,Feb 24 2020,"* Could supply more than 600,000 households * Largest debt package so far for Taiwanese offshore wind LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Fund management company Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) said it has met all the conditions to secure around $3 billion in financing for a nearly 600 megawatt (MW) offshore wind project off the coast of Taiwan. The loan for the Changfang and Xidao project is the largest debt package yet for Taiwan’s offshore wind market. It is financed by equity and senior loans from a consortium of 25 international and Taiwanese banks, financial institutions and 6 export credit agencies, CIP said. Commissioning for a first phase of up to 100 MW is scheduled for the end of 2021, with a second 500 MW phase scheduled for the start of 2024. “Reaching financial close marks a major milestone for the Changfang and Xidao project,” Michael Hannibal, partner at CIP, said in a statement. Once commercial operations start, he said the project could supply more than 600,000 households in Taiwan. ","{'neg': 0.03, 'neu': 0.939, 'pos': 0.03, 'compound': 0.0}",0
"Despite attacks, Sanders' Medicare for All boosts early-state triumphs",Feb 24 2020,"(Reuters) - In the days leading up to Saturday’s Democratic presidential caucuses in Nevada, Bernie Sanders withstood one attack after another over his Medicare for All plan – both from his rivals and the state’s powerful hotel and casino workers’ union. But entrance polls from Edison Research showed more than 60% of caucus-goers favored replacing private insurance with a government-run plan, suggesting Sanders’ sweeping proposal helped deliver his decisive win in Nevada rather than damaging his bid. Those figures were similar to what polls found in the first two contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, where around 60% of voters also backed Medicare for All and Sanders had strong showings. Among Nevadans who supported a single-payer plan, 49% said they were backing Sanders – more than three times that of any other candidate. If that dynamic holds in South Carolina, which votes on Saturday, and on March 3, when 14 states host elections on “Super Tuesday,” Sanders could open up an commanding lead despite moderates’ efforts to derail him. The question for Sanders, and the Democratic Party, is whether Medicare for All could become a liability in November’s general election against Republican President Donald Trump, when the Democratic nominee and hundreds of down-ballot candidates may need the support of swing voters and disaffected Trump supporters. “I don’t see most Democrats staying home or defecting because of Medicare for All as an issue,” said Joel Payne, a veteran of Democratic presidential campaigns. “What I do see is Democrats being concerned that it is an alienating issue for independents and ‘sometimes Trumpers.’” There are signs the issue could be a tougher sell in the general election. Polling data released on Friday from the Kaiser Family Foundation found Medicare for All draws support from a slight majority of Americans. But two-thirds of the public back a public option, which would allow individuals to buy into a government plan but would not require it. The latter proposal is similar to those put forth by Sanders’ main moderate rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has coined the phrase “Medicare for all who want it” to describe his plan. At a debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday, both Buttigieg and Biden castigated Sanders for failing to explain how he would finance Medicare for All, which could cost more than $35 trillion over 10 years, according to some estimates. On Saturday night, Buttigieg told supporters his healthcare plan offered more freedom. “Senator Sanders believes in taking away that choice, removing people from having the option of a private plan and replacing it with a public plan whether you want it or not,” Buttigieg said. Speaking after his resounding victory in Nevada was confirmed, Sanders remained resolute. “Together we are going to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America, our great country, being the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people,” he told a crowd in Texas. Some Democrats have said a Sanders nomination risks ceding the party’s electoral advantage on healthcare. In 2018, when Democrats recaptured control of the U.S. House of Representatives, many candidates focused on Republican efforts to repeal of the Affordable Care Act. The Kaiser foundation’s polling has found skepticism about Medicare for All among swing voters, particularly in the key battleground states of Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. “That means it could be a much different story in the general election,” Kaiser chief executive Drew Altman said on Sunday. Analysts said Democrats could still win the healthcare argument if they emphasize Republicans’ failure to propose an alternative. Within the Democratic Party, the distinctions between plans may not matter as much as the common goal. “While individual Democratic candidates disagree with one another on the speed with which to achieve universal healthcare coverage, I don’t think there’s that much disagreement that that is a goal of the Democratic Party,” said Kyle Kondik, an elections analyst at the University of Virginia. Sanders has argued his agenda will inspire record-level turnout among people who typically do not participate, lessening the need to appeal to centrist voters. His dominating victory on Saturday saw him win among voters with and without college degrees, union and nonunion households, and among liberal and moderate or conservative Democrats. The 35% of voters who said they oppose Medicare for All supported Biden, Buttigieg and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, with Sanders pulling only 8% of those Nevadans. The powerful Culinary Workers Union had attacked Sanders’ Medicare for All plan, warning it would replace the union’s popular and hard-fought health benefits. But rank-and-file members appeared to go against the wishes of their leadership and largely backed Sanders anyway, according to entrance polling and interviews. Outside a caucus at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino, housekeeper Guadeloupe Niswonger, 54, said she liked Sanders’ Medicare for All plan better than her current coverage. Another housekeeper, Aleiza Smith, 22, said Sanders’ liberal policy proposals appealed to her - prompting her to go against the wishes of Culinary Workers Union leadership. “I’m not big into politics, but I like the things he’s going for: student loan debt, schools, free healthcare,” Smith said.

Dollar's gains push pound towards three-month lows,Feb 24 2020,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling fell on Monday as rising fears about the economic impact of the spreading coronavirus encouraged investors to seek safety in the U.S. dollar. The British pound dropped as investors scrambled out of assets deemed riskier in favour of the dollar. Most analysts see the U.S. economy as relatively well-shielded should the coronavirus hurt global growth significantly.  The pound’s weakness on Monday was largely a dollar strength story, with hedge funds turning cautiously optimistic on sterling in recent weeks. The latest figures show funds have ramped up long positions in the pound to near two-year highs.  Those net positions look large in relation to recent market moves, but they remain a long way from 2018 highs, suggesting there is more room for gains. The pound has been supported in recent weeks by better-than-expected economic data and growing expectations that the new UK finance minister will announce more spending at next month’s budget. But those gains have been capped by broad dollar strength and worries about Britain’s trade talks with the European Union. “A quiet week in terms of data releases is going to leave space to the other two key drivers of GBP: UK-EU trade negotiations and hints about the content of the upcoming UK budget,” ING analysts said in a research note. “We suspect both will hardly come to the support of the pound, as the negotiations may enter an even more confrontational phase and the government is unlikely to endorse the market’s high fiscal hopes.” On Monday, the pound fell 0.2% to $1.2930, not far from the three-month low of $1.2849 it hit last week. Versus the euro, the pound weakened 0.4% to 84.02 pence.   ","{'neg': 0.076, 'neu': 0.81, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': 0.8898}",0.8898

The company plans to raise the amount at a price of $220 per share and the latest funding round is not expected to close until the second week of March, according to the report  SpaceX did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.  SpaceX has been launching Starlink satellites in batches of 60 since May and currently has roughly 300 orbiting Earth in a sprint to make the broadband internet service operational in the United States and Canada by the end of 2020. Chief Executive Musk plans to use the Starlink revenue to help fund development of its next-generation rocket dubbed Starship, which is designed to lift defense payloads to space and eventually send humans to the moon.  The company has long-term plans to spin Starlink off as a publicly traded company in the next several years, a company official told Reuters earlier this month. The funding round reported by CNBC would come months ahead of SpaceX’s first manned mission to space under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program.  The company’s Crew Dragon space taxi is being developed alongside rival Boeing Co’s Starliner capsule, both of which have suffered cost overruns and schedule delays in the space program.

"Exclusive: If Lebanon needs financial aid, France will be there, finmin says",Feb 23 2020,"RIYADH (Reuters) - France is ready to support Lebanon financially - bilaterally or multilaterally - its finance minister said on Sunday, warning against mixing economic recovery in the small Mediterranean state with U.S.-led efforts to counter Iran in the region. “France always stands ready to help Lebanon. It has always been the case in the past and it will be the case in the future...” Bruno Le Maire told Reuters at the end of a meeting of finance officials from the Group of 20 (G20) major economies. “If there is any help required from Lebanon, France will be there.” Lebanon’s long-brewing economic crisis spiraled last year as the country’s capital inflows slowed and protests erupted against the ruling elite. As the crisis deepens, hitting ordinary Lebanese hard, there is no sign of foreign aid. Western and Sunni-led Gulf Arab states that helped in the past have made clear that any support hinges on Beirut implementing long-delayed reforms to address root causes such as state corruption and bad governance. Saudi Arabia’s finance minister said on Sunday the kingdom was in contact with allies and international bodies to coordinate any support for Lebanon on the basis of economic reforms proposed by Beirut. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Reuters in an interview that Washington was keeping a close eye on the situation. “It’s something we’re monitoring – both the political and economic issues there,” he said. “Our interest is in the people of Lebanon. We want there to be safe environment where they can succeed economically and live as they want to.” An International Monetary Fund (IMF) team has discussed all possible options in recent meetings with Lebanese officials, who are seeking technical advice for tackling the crisis as Beirut mulls a plan for dealing with fast-approaching debt payments. Le Maire said decisions by Lebanon’s government were urgently needed to improve the situation on the ground. “We want to move in the official fora and we think that the IMF might have a role to play at one stage, but it’s up to the Lebanese government to decide,” he said. “But if there is any need for help, either bilateral or multilateral, we stand ready to help.” Since protests erupted in October, Lebanon’s currency has slumped by roughly 60% on a parallel market, dollars have become scarce, prices have been hiked and thousands of jobs have been shed. Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab’s government took office last month with the backing of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shi’ite group, and its allies, as Washington presses its policy of “maximum pressure” against Iran with wide-ranging sanctions. “We know that there are ties between the two issues but we don’t want to mix the issue of economic recovery in Lebanon, which is today the clear emergency, and the question of Iran,” Le Maire added.

Exclusive: U.S. sees no material impact from virus on U.S.-China trade deal - for now,Feb 24 2020,"RIYADH (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Reuters he does not expect the coronavirus outbreak to have a material impact on the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal, although that could change as more data becomes available in coming weeks. Finance officials from the world’s 20 largest economies said on Sunday they would keep a close watch on the fast-spreading outbreak, but stopped short of identifying it as downside risk to the global economy.  Fears of a coronavirus pandemic mounted even as they met in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, with sharp rises in new cases reported in Iran, Italy and South Korea. Mnuchin, in an interview with Reuters late on Sunday, cautioned against jumping to conclusions about the impact of what he called a “human tragedy” on the global economy, or on companies’ supply chain decisions, saying it was simply too soon to know.  China was focused on the virus for now, he said, but Washington still expected Beijing to live up to its commitments to buy more U.S. products and services under the trade deal. “I don’t expect that this will have any ramifications on Phase 1. Based on everything that we know, and where the virus is now, I don’t expect that it’s going to be material,” he said. “Obviously that could change as the situation develops. Within the next few more weeks, we’ll all have a better assessment as there’s more data around the rate of the virus spreading.” Mnuchin met late on Sunday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a senior U.S. administration official said, but gave no details about the meeting. Mnuchin acknowledged the outbreak could also delay the start of negotiations on deepening the trade deal with Beijing and reaching a Phase 2 agreement, but said he was not worried about that at this point. “If we get the right deal before the election, that’s great. If we get the right deal after the election, that’s great. We don’t feel any pressure one way or another,” he said, referring to the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, in which President Donald Trump is seeking reelection. Mnuchin noted that the contagion factor with COVID-19, the acronym for the virus, was higher than with the SARS outbreak in China in the early 2000s, but said the survival rate appeared to be much higher. In a separate news conference, he said there could be some short-term impact on supply chains, but cautioned against the idea that it could increase concerns about globalization. Big companies were always assessing risks and adjusting supply chains, he added.    ","{'neg': 0.058, 'neu': 0.869, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.8435}",0.8435
Explainer: Malaysia's political maneuvering after PM Mahathir quits,Feb 24 2020,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia’s 94-year-old Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad resigned on Monday, plunging the country into political turmoil less than two years after a surprise election victory.  Not necessarily. It is possible that he could return at the head of a new government if it can put together a parliamentary majority. Several groups called on him to do so. The king accepted Mahathir’s resignation but appointed him interim prime minister. He has outfoxed opponents for decades during two stints as prime minister. The first was from 1981 to 2003 and the second since 2018, when he joined with old rival Anwar Ibrahim to oust the party that had held power for 60 years over accusations of widespread corruption. Mahathir did not explain, but the decision follows surprise talks at the weekend between members of his coalition and the opposition on forming a new government. At the root of the turmoil is Mahathir’s promise to hand over to Anwar under the terms of a pre-election pact.  Mahathir had been under pressure from Anwar’s supporters to set a clear timetable for ceding power, but he had refused. The argument came to a head last week and helped prompt the weekend talks. Anwar and people close to Mahathir said he had quit after accusations that he would form some sort of partnership with opposition parties he defeated less than two years ago on an anti-corruption platform. “He thought that he shouldn’t be treated in that manner, to associate him in working with those we believe are blatantly corrupt,” Anwar told reporters. Anwar was Mahathir’s deputy during his earlier stint as prime minister, but they fell out over the handling of the Asian financial crisis and he was fired in 1998. Soon after Anwar was jailed for sodomy, charges he says were trumped up.  The ruling coalition has also been under pressure after losing five by-elections since the 2018 election.  The fact that there are so many possible scenarios has deepened the turmoil. To win power, a coalition needs to convince the king it has the support of a minimum of 112 out of the 222 members of parliament. Some possibilities are: * Mahathir returns as prime minister with the support of those who remained in his Pakatan Harapan coalition plus some support from elsewhere.      * Mahathir returns as prime minister with support of a new coalition - potentially including old enemies. * Mahathir bows out, paving the way for a race between Anwar and an alliance of Muhyiddin Yassin, from Mahathir’s party, and Azmin Ali, who on Monday was sacked from Anwar’s party.  * No side shows it can summon a clear majority and the king agrees to a new election. It’s hard to tell before a coalition is formed. But the coalition under discussion at the weekend would have had a bigger representation of Malay interests than the previous one. This could mean renewed focus on the country’s decades-old positive discrimination policy for majority Malays, who enjoyed preferential access to everything from public financing to a 30% quota for equity holdings in businesses. Any coalition would be expected to say that it would fight corruption and address bread and butter issues. As well as confusion, there are signs of growing public anger. Some Malaysians say the former coalition would betray them if it brought in politicians defeated in 2018. Protests have become a regular affair since the 1990s. A coalition of NGOs, led by pro-electoral reform group Bersih 2.0, has raised the possibility of a mass rally. The atmosphere is not helped by the flagging economy. Malaysia’s economic growth slowed to the weakest in a decade in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the coronavirus outbreak threatened to pile on more pressure this year. The government had been due to announce a stimulus package this week. ","{'neg': 0.133, 'neu': 0.755, 'pos': 0.112, 'compound': -0.947}",-0.947
Factbox: Remaining hurdles for scandal-hit Wells Fargo,Feb 22 2020,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co () has racked up well over $7 billion in penalties since a sales practices scandal erupted in 2016, and continues to face headwinds. Here are some of the remaining shoes that have yet to drop: More hearings: The House Financial Services Committee said on Friday that it will conduct three Wells Fargo hearings next month where new Chief Executive Charles Scharf and other company officials will be probed about the scandal. The bank’s executives have in the past been called to testify before Congress about the bank’s wrongdoings and explain how the bank has changed. Scharf has tried to place the scandal squarely in the past, describing “historical” and “legacy” issues, but lawmakers will rehash Wells Fargo’s mistakes in public.  Consent orders: Wells Fargo is currently operating under roughly 14 consent orders with various regulators including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Under the orders, the bank will endure intense regulatory scrutiny until it proves it has fixed procedures that allowed employees to create potentially millions of unauthorized accounts, and sell auto insurance and other add-on products that customers did not want or need. The orders also require Wells Fargo to repay customers for costs associated with its consumer abuses. So far the bank has paid out at least tens of millions of dollars in remediation. Asset cap: The most notable consent order looming over the bank is the U.S. Federal Reserve’s asset cap, which put an unprecedented growth restriction on the bank’s balance sheet until it proves that it has overhauled its risk management and controls.  Since the asset cap was announced in early 2018, bank executives repeatedly extended the timeline for getting it removed and have since stopped giving any guidance on the issue. On his first public conference call last month, Scharf did not set a new timeline. Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating: Even if Wells Fargo’s asset cap is lifted, its growth could still be hampered by its CRA rating, which assesses how well banks service poorer communities. In 2017, federal regulators downgraded Wells Fargo two notches to “Needs to Improve” from “Outstanding” shortly after the scandal broke. The rating, which is typically only reviewed every five years, curtails the bank’s ability to make acquisitions and open branches, and requires Wells Fargo to seek regulatory approval in financing decisions like issuing or prepaying debt. A less than satisfactory rating also prevents the bank from courting certain government business. ","{'neg': 0.083, 'neu': 0.761, 'pos': 0.157, 'compound': 0.9849}",0.9849

France should make more of the goods it needs as epidemic shows risk-finmin,Feb 23 2020,"RIYADH, Feb 23 (Reuters) - France should aim to produce more of the goods it deems strategic, such as drugs and electric batteries, as the coronavirus outbreak lays bare the danger of relying on imports from China, the country’s finance minister said on Sunday.

China is doing the same, the United States are doing the same, I don’t know why Europe would not do the same for strategic assets like electric batteries,” he added.

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire also told reporters in Abu Dhabi that he had discussed the situation in Lebanon with the United Arab Emirates leadership. “We are very concerned,” Le Maire said, adding that the United Arab Emirates and France will decide separately if and how to support the government in Beirut. “We (France) are looking at different options, maybe an IMF programme if the Lebanese government asks for one... but we will not manage any effort to help Lebanon.” Lebanon has been under pressure from international investors as well as local protesters, and its government is running out of options to avoid defaulting on its debts. An IMF team has discussed all possible options in recent meetings with Lebanese officials seeking technical advice. As the crisis deepens, hitting ordinary Lebanese hard, there is no sign of foreign aid to the deeply indebted country. In Riyadh, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday that he had discussed options for Lebanon with IMF and G7 finance officials over the weekend at a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors. “Lebanon is an area where we’d like to see both political and economic stability,” Mnuchin told CNBC in an interview. But he said the country would need to implement some difficult reforms. “This isn’t about bailing out existing creditors or bailing out the economy,” Mnuchin said.  “The IMF is really there to support the economy and the politicians if they are willing to make the hard economic choices to move forward and strengthen their economy, which I think would be good for the people of Lebanon, and it’s too early for us to tell whether they’re willing to do that or not.” Former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri rushed last year to Abu Dhabi seeking investments and financial aid when protests erupted against the country’s ruling elite. However, Western and Sunni-led Gulf Arab states that helped in the past have made clear that any support depends on Beirut implementing long-delayed reforms to address root causes such as state corruption and bad governance. “Each country will decide in a sovereign way what to do,” Le Maire said.

"G20 finance heads eye impact of coronavirus outbreak on growth, see modest pickup",Feb 23 2020,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Finance chiefs of the world’s top 20 economies vowed to monitor the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on global growth and act if needed, as they said loose monetary policy and easing trade tensions would prompt a pick-up in 2020 and 2021. The Group of 20 (G20) finance ministers and central bank heads faced a sober presentation by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which predicted the epidemic would shave 0.1 percentage points off global growth. “We will enhance global risk monitoring, including of the recent outbreak of COVID-19. We stand ready to take further action to address these risks,” the statement from the financial leaders said, using the medical acronym for the disease caused by the new coronavirus. “Global growth is expected to pick up modestly in 2020 and 2021,” they predicted. “The recovery is supported by the continuation of accommodative financial conditions and some signs of easing trade tensions.” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said central bankers would look at options to respond to the epidemic if needed, while Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he was ready to ease policy if necessary.  China was represented at the G20 meeting by its ambassador to Saudi Arabia, as senior officials stayed away due to the growing crisis over the virus. Chinese state television quoted China’s President Xi Jinping as saying on Sunday Beijing would step up policy adjustments to help cushion the blow on the economy from the outbreak. “The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia will inevitably have a relatively big impact on the economy and society,” Xi said, though he added the effects would be short-term and controllable. Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told a news conference at the meeting: “We have discussed the outbreak of coronavirus in China and other countries and all the G20 countries agreed collectively on being ready to intervene with necessary policies.”  The epidemic, which originated in China, has since spread to nearly 30 countries and territories. South Korea raised its infectious disease alert to its highest level on Sunday but the European Union saw “no need to panic” over an outbreak in Italy. “In our current baseline scenario, announced policies are implemented and China’s economy would return to normal in the second quarter,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Saturday. “As a result, the impact on the world economy would be relatively minor and short-lived.” “But we are also looking at more dire scenarios where the spread of the virus continues for longer and more globally, and the growth consequences are more protracted,” she added. The ministers and central bankers also encouraged further work by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on global rules to tax digital giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook. Intergovernmental group the OECD is to prepare technical assumptions by July that would allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes. The group’s efforts were stalled late last year by last-minute changes demanded by Washington, including a proposed “safe harbor” regime which critics say would let multinationals choose whether to abide by the new set of rules or stick to existing regulations. “I told my counterparts that Japan is very concerned about the ‘safe harbor’ proposal,” Japan’s Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters, joining a chorus of criticism by France and other nations over the U.S. proposal. “It would extremely diminish the regulatory effect of what we’re trying to do. That is a view expressed by various countries,” he said. Mnuchin warned, however, that he opposed discriminatory taxes on digital services, the providers of which are mostly from the United States.  He said Washington would respond with investigations and potential retaliatory tariffs if countries decided to go it alone, outside the OECD deal.  A final agreement on the global rules is to be ready by the end of this year to avoid a proliferation of different digital tax regimes all over the world.

As the delegates wrapped up their meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping was quoted as saying that Beijing will step up policy adjustments to help cushion the blow on the economy from the outbreak. “The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia will inevitably have a relatively big impact on the economy and society,” Xi said, adding the impact would be short-term and controllable. China was represented at the G20 meeting by its ambassador to Saudi Arabia, as senior officials stayed away due to the growing crisis over the virus. The epidemic, which originated in China has since spread to nearly 30 countries and territories. South Korea raised its infectious disease alert to its highest level on Sunday, while a third passenger from a virus-infected cruise ship in Japan died. “In our current baseline scenario, announced policies are implemented and China’s economy would return to normal in the second quarter. As a result, the impact on the world economy would be relatively minor and short-lived,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Saturday. “But we are also looking at more dire scenarios where the spread of the virus continues for longer and more globally, and the growth consequences are more protracted,” she added. In a draft G20 communique seen by Reuters, the finance leaders clung to their upbeat projection of a modest pick-up in global growth despite the outbreak.

"IMF chief, Argentina flag path to new debt deal after G20 meet in Riyadh",Feb 23 2020,"RIYADH/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina on Saturday agreed to start consultations with the International Monetary Fund that could lead to a new financing program, days after the global lender said the country’s debt situation had become “unsustainable”. Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman told IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva that the heavily indebted Latin American country would initiate formal consultations with the IMF that could lay the groundwork for a new program, the Argentine government and the IMF said in separate statements. Guzman and Georgieva met on the sidelines of a meeting of finance officials from the world’s 20 largest economies in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. “The minister informed the managing director of the government’s intention to initiate Article IV consultations, which the minister called a valuable step that will deepen mutual understanding between the Argentine government and the IMF on the way toward a new program with the agency,” the government it said. Article IV talks would allow the IMF to inspect Argentina’s accounts before a new agreement is signed. This would give an assurance to bondholders as they head into restructuring talks that Argentina, notorious for mismanaging its debt, is under IMF supervision. The South American country has defaulted on debt obligations eight times so far and Guzman has said he wanted the upcoming bond revamp to be done in a spirit of cooperation. Finance officials at the G20 meeting expressed relief that Argentina’s new government had agreed to remain engaged with the IMF, saying it lowered the risk of a messy default at a time when the global economy is facing heightened risks due to the fast-spreading coronavirus. But Mark Sobel, a former senior U.S. Treasury official and adviser to the London-based OMFIF think-tank, said the decision to consult with the IMF, but not move directly into a new program, reflected the new Peronist government’s historic aversion to the Fund. “They’re not walking away, but they’re also not going to be in a Fund program for a bit, and who knows when,” he said. Georgieva said on Saturday she had a “very fruitful exchange of views” with Guzman about putting the country on a path to more sustainable and inclusive growth. She said the newly elected Argentine government - initially deeply skeptical about continued involvement with the IMF - had agreed to deepen its engagement with the Fund through formal consultations as it worked to “secure a sustainable and orderly resolution of Argentina’s debt situation”. Argentina is facing tough negotiations with creditors and the IMF to restructure around $100 billion in debt that the country’s government says that it cannot pay unless given time to revive stalled economic growth. The IMF, which wrapped up a visit to Argentina earlier this week, has said the country’s debt situation had become “unsustainable” and that private creditors would need to make a “meaningful contribution” to resolve the crisis. Georgieva, a Bulgarian and the first official from an emerging market economy to head the IMF, commended the efforts of the Argentine government to put in place policies aimed at stabilizing the economy, reducing poverty and dealing with its debt. “In this context, I welcomed the Argentine authorities’ commitment to continue to deepen our engagement including through an Article IV Consultation and steps toward a Fund-supported program in the future. The modalities of these next steps will continue to be discussed,” she said. The IMF gave Argentina a $57 billion standby financing agreement in 2018, but that program was agreed by the previous government and has been essentially on ice since the election. The Argentine government said Guzman’s meeting with the IMF chief “deepened mutual understanding and set the stage for future talks”. It was not immediately clear when those talks would begin.

UPDATE 1-Italy state lawyers warn govt of risks in Atlantia dispute - source,Feb 22 2020,"* State lawyers say revocation unlikely to stand up in EU Court * Government still cool on latest Atlantia concession offer * Some in coalition want Atlantia to sell entire Autostrade stake (Adds sources and background) By Giuseppe Fonte ROME, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Italy’s attorney general has warned the prime minister’s office that stripping infrastructure group Atlantia of its lucrative motorway concession could be overturned by the European Court of Justice, a government source said on Friday. The coalition has threatened to revoke the licence of Atlantia’s motorway unit Autostrade per l’Italia following a bridge collapse which killed 43 people in the northern city of Genoa in 2018. After months of political and legal wrangling, the government has been awaiting the attorney general’s opinion before taking a final decision on the issue. Atlantia has always denied wrongdoing in the Genoa disaster and said it would challenge any revocation, raising the risk of a multi-billion euro compensation payment by the government. With public debt at 135% of gross domestic product, proportionally the highest in the euro zone after Greece, Italy is wary of putting further pressure on its public finances. The government has paved the way for a revocation by presenting legislation aimed at making it easier and less costly under Italian law. The new rules are due to be approved by parliament this month. In the meantime Atlantia and the government have made preliminary contacts to find a compromise, but there has been no apparent progress towards a settlement. Despite the new rules, “state lawyers stated that any revocation would be unlikely to stand up in the European Court of Justice,” said the source, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. The prime minister’s office was not available to comment. Italy’s financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore first reported the legal opinion. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Thursday urged Atlantia to make a settlement proposal before the government decides on revocation. In an interview with Corriere della Sera daily on Friday, Atlantia Chief Executive Carlo Bertazzo said an offer had already been sent to the government, but the source told Reuters there was “not yet a convincing proposal from Atlantia.” The source said Rome would insist on tough conditions to consider dropping its plan to withdraw the licence, wanting to set new rules on road tariff hikes which are less favourable to Atlantia and to force it to invest 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) on motorway maintenance. A second government source said some prominent figures within the coalition were campaigning for Atlantia to sell its 88% stake in Autostrade. Atlantia has already offered to cut its stake to under 50% as a way to reduce the influence of the Benetton family, which owns 30% of Atlantia but has been tainted in public opinion since the Genoa disaster. To facilitate this, Banca IMI, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Mediobanca are working on a plan under which Autostrade and state-backed fund F2i would set up a joint infrastructure fund, two sources close to the matter said. Atlantia, F2i and JP Morgan declined comment. Banca IMI, Goldman and Mediobanca weren’t immediately available to comment. ","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.881, 'pos': 0.059, 'compound': -0.1542}",-0.1542
Lawsuit in NY claims ex-hedge fund manager Falcone reneged on loans,Feb 22 2020,"NEW YORK, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Former hedge fund manager Philip Falcone has been sued for more than $65.8 million after he allegedly defaulted on a series of loans and sold some of the underlying collateral, including an Andy Warhol painting. In papers filed on Friday with the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Melody Business Finance LLC said Falcone and several business affiliates have reneged on their obligations to repay the loans, which date from 2013 to 2017. Melody said Falcone has cited obligations to other creditors, including New York’s attorney general and New York City, for his inability to repay the loans or turn over the collateral, which also includes millions of dollars in jewelry. Falcone previously ran Harbinger Capital Partners, which once oversaw $26 billion of assets. He is now chief executive of a New York-based HC2 Holdings Inc, which has businesses in construction, marine services and several other sectors. HC2 did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A law firm that Melody said represents Falcone in the dispute did not immediately respond to similar requests. According to court papers, the pledged collateral also included works by Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso and Camille Pissarro, as well as several Warhols. Melody said Falcone mentioned last fall that he sold a Warhol and a painting by Japan’s Yayoi Kusama that were among the collateral at Christie’s. In April 2017, Alabama-based Harbert Management Corp, which had sponsored Harbinger, reached a $40 million settlement with the New York attorney general’s office for nonpayment of taxes. Then in September 2018, an offshore hedge fund firm once led by Falcone agreed to pay $30 million to resolve New York state and city tax claims.

"Let's come together to tax tech giants, say G20 officials eying $100 bln boost",Feb 22 2020,"* G20 officials aim for deal on taxing digital firms by end 2020 * OECD close to deal on minimum level of tax for digital firms * OECD estimates new tax revenue from digital at $100 bln a year By Stephen Kalin and Andrea Shalal RIYADH, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Leading world economies must show unity in dealing with aggressive “tax optimisation” by global digital giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook, G20 officials said on Saturday. Global rules are being developed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to make digital companies pay tax where they do business, rather than where they register subsidiaries. The OECD says this could boost national tax revenues by a total of $100 billion a year. The call for unity appeared mainly directed at the United States, home to the biggest tech companies, in an attempt to head off any stalling on the rules until after the American presidential election in November. “There is no time to wait for elections,” German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told a tax seminar on the sidelines of a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers. “This needs leadership in certain countries,” Scholz said looking directly at U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, sitting next to him at the seminar. The taxing of digital firms and the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on the global economy are among the hot topic for G20 financial leaders, from the world’s 20 largest economies, during their talks in Riyadh this weekend. The OECD wants to set a minimum effective level at which such companies would be taxed and seeks agreement by the start of July, with an endorsement by the G20 by the end of the year. “A coordinated answer is not the better way forward, but, given the alternatives, the only way forward,” OECD head Angel Gurria told the seminar. But the OECD efforts were stalled late last year by last-minute changes demanded by Washington, which many G20 officials view as reluctant to deal with a potentially politically tricky matter before the presidential election. Mnuchin said OECD countries were close to an agreement on the minimum tax level, which he said would also go a long way to resolving the issue of where tax is payed. “I think we all want to get this done by the end of the year, and that’s the objective,” Mnuchin told the seminar. Several European countries, including France, Spain, Austria, Italy, Britain and Hungary either already have a plan for a digital tax or are working on one, creating the risk of a highly fragmented global system. “You cannot have in a global economy different national tax systems that conflict with each other,” Mnuchin said.

Halo Cars was founded in 2018 and has operations in U.S. markets such as New York and Chicago.

Montenegro introduces cap and trade scheme for major CO2 emitters,Feb 24 2020,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - The European Union’s energy watchdog praised Montenegro on Monday for introducing legislation to limit the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) as well as an emission trading scheme for large industrial emitters. “Montenegro continues to lead the way ... in the establishment of a complete system required to reduce GHG, protect the ozone layer and adapt to climate change,” the Energy Community, established by the EU and nine aspiring member states to extend EU energy policy to would-be members, said in a statement. The legislation specifies the operators participating in emissions trading and also determines the total amount and minimum price of 24 euros ($26) per ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) of emission credits to be auctioned. It also established a stabilization reserve, the method of recording allocated emission credits, their transfer and use. The funds raised from the emission credits auction would be transferred into the Environmental Protection Fund and used for environmental protection measures, renewables support and the financing of innovations. Montenegro last year scrapped plans to add a 254 megawatt (MW) unit at the Pljevlja coal-fired power plant, becoming the first Western Balkans country in the coal-reliant region to take tougher stance on air pollution from coal. The EU candidate country also aims to add new wind and solar capacity to help meet the bloc’s renewable energy targets and cut greenhouse gas emissions. Most Western Balkan countries have failed to fulfill the first requirement to meet EU industrial emissions standards despite commitments governments made in 2005. Environmentalists want the EU to impose a tax on carbon dioxide or a border carbon tax to ensure the region’s heavy polluters stop using a lack of investment in pollution control as a market advantage when exporting power to the bloc.

UPDATE 1-Moody's lowers outlook to 'stable' on France's ratings,Feb 22 2020,"(adds background on French economy, yellow vest protests) Feb 21 (Reuters) - Moody’s Investors Service on Friday downgraded outlook on France’s ratings to stable from positive, citing insufficient measures to manage a sustainable and clear downward trend in the country’s public debt ratio. France’s fiscal strength will not improve to the extent that the rating agency envisaged when assigning the positive outlook on the Aa2 rating in May 2018, Moody’s said in a statement. The French economy unexpectedly shrank in the final quarter of last year as manufacturing output slumped in the face of strikes over an unpopular pension reform, putting more pressure on President Emmanuel Macron. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire considered the slowdown temporary. Moody’s also highlighted it is unlikely for the French government to reach its own fiscal targets in the remainder of the government’s term, given the continued high level of social discontent which was at the heart of the “yellow vest” protests. The yellow vest protests, named for the high-visibility jackets worn by demonstrators, erupted in November 2018 over fuel price hikes and the high cost of living. The ratings agency affirmed France’s ratings at Aa2 based on the country’s progress in its economic reform programme. Moody’s said that despite the high levels, France’s public debt is highly affordable and will likely remain so even when policy rates start rising.

More UK spending? Higher taxes look inevitable: think-tank,Feb 24 2020,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s new finance minister Rishi Sunak will have to raise taxes rather than simply tweaking budget rules if he wants to ramp up spending in the first post-Brexit budget next month,  the Resolution Foundation think-tank said on Monday. Sunak is due to announce the tax and spending plans of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government on March 11. His predecessor Sajid Javid unexpectedly quit less than two weeks ago, prompting speculation that Johnson wants to raise spending by more than budget rules set by Javid allow. Johnson plans to help voters in struggling regions who backed him in December’s election by spending more on infrastructure, a big shift for his Conservative Party, which for the past 10 years has focused on fixing the public finances. “But new roads and rail lines are only part of the story,” Resolution Foundation economist Jack Leslie said.  Johnson has also announced the biggest increase in spending on day-to-day public services in 15 years. “Higher spending will require higher taxes,” Leslie said. Britain’s fiscal forecasters assess each budget against fiscal rules that the finance ministry sets itself. Javid’s rules aim to balance day-to-day spending against tax revenue within three years. The Sunday Times reported that Sunak was considering pushing back that target to five years. David Gauke, a former deputy finance minister who left the Conservative Party last year in a dispute over Brexit policy, said Sunak would be under pressure to show his independence from Johnson, given the circumstances of his appointment. “It’s not so much what Rishi does as what he doesn’t do ... that there isn’t a huge loosening of the fiscal rules. If I was him that would be my objective in this budget.” The Resolution Foundation said delaying balancing day-to-day spending would create only 15 billion pounds of extra fiscal firepower by the 2024/25 financial year, less margin for error than previous finance ministers have had at a time when spending demands are growing. “The big question for (Sunak) is the extent to which he undoes big spending cuts to day-to-day public services, and how that is paid for,” the Resolution Foundation said. Gauke did not see appetite in the Conservative Party for higher taxes, and said even a modest further loosening of fiscal policy would set public debt as a share of GDP — a key measure of fiscal sustainability — on an upward trend. This would be a historically unusual position for the Conservatives, and it would be dangerous to assume near record-low borrowing costs would last, he added. “Markets tend to be forgiving until they are not. That might happen very quickly,” Gauke said. Sunak could increase tax revenues by cutting back incentives for private pension contributions, fixing loopholes in inheritance tax and reforming property taxes, the Resolution Foundation said.   There was likely to be some good news for Sunak as he prepared the budget — reduced debt servicing costs from lower interest rates and inflation mean he will pocket a “a modest fiscal windfall” of 8 billion pounds ($10.4 billion) a year by the 2022/23 financial year, the Resolution Foundation said.

Ardern added that it was highly likely the virus would eventually arrive in New Zealand, although it has no confirmed infections. Finance Minister Grant Robertson said the government would step in to assist businesses hit by the spread of the virus, if there is a long lasting shock to the economy or a global economic recession, but he did not expect one at the moment. “If either of these scenarios play out it will be important for the government to play a role to invest in the economy to support New Zealanders and Kiwi businesses,” he added. New Zealand’s exports to largest trading partner China have taken a major hit, with everything from timber to meat and fruit facing delays and cancellations. By Sunday, the epidemic had killed 2,592 people with 77,150 infections on the mainland. Australia, which also has a travel ban on foreigners arriving directly from China, said its citizens should now “exercise a high degree of caution” if travelling to South Korea or Japan.

"New coronavirus cases fall in China, but WHO concerned by global spread",Feb 22 2020,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China reported a sharp fall in new deaths and cases of the coronavirus on Saturday, but world health officials warned it was too early to make predictions about the outbreak as new infections continued to rise in other countries. Chinese authorities said the mainland had 397 new confirmed cases on Friday, down from 889 a day earlier. The numbers surged elsewhere, though, with outbreaks worsening in South Korea, Iran, Italy and Lebanon.  In South Korea, authorities said on Saturday the number of new infections had doubled to 433, and suggested the tally could rise significantly as more than 1,000 people who attended a church at the center of the outbreak reported flu-like symptoms. The World Health Organization welcomed the reported decline in new Chinese cases, but said it was concerned about the number of new infections elsewhere with no clear link to China such as travel history or contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19, as the disease caused by the virus is known. “Our biggest concern continues to be the potential for COVID-19 to spread in countries with weaker health systems,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. The U.N. agency is calling for $675 million to support most vulnerable countries, he said, adding 13 countries in Africa are seen as a priority because of their links to China. In total, China has reported 75,569 cases to the WHO, and 2,239 deaths, Tedros said. According to available data, the disease remains mild in 80% of patients, and severe or critical in 20%. The virus has been fatal in 2% of reported cases. The disease has spread to some 26 countries and territories outside mainland China, killing more than a dozen people, according to a Reuters tally. The latest Chinese figures showed only 31 of the new cases on Friday were outside of the virus epicenter of Hubei province, the lowest number since the National Health Commission started compiling nationwide data a month ago. But new, albeit isolated findings about the coronavirus could complicate efforts to thwart it, including the Hubei government’s announcement on Saturday that an elderly man took 27 days to show symptoms after infection, almost twice the presumed 14-day incubation period. That follows Chinese scientists reporting that a woman from Wuhan had traveled 400 miles (675 km) and infected five relatives without showing signs of infection. State television showed the arrival in Wuhan of the “blue whale” on Saturday, the first of seven river cruise ships it is bringing in to house medical workers, tens of thousands of which have been sent to Hubei to contain the virus. In Italy, the worst-affected country in Europe, the virus has killed two people - a man and a woman in their 70s - and infected another 51 mostly in the north. Some 50,000 residents in Codogno, southwest of Milan, and nearby towns have been advised to remain indoors. Public gatherings including Sunday masses and football matches have been suspended, and schools and shops have been closed down.   Iran, which had no reported cases earlier this week, on Saturday announced the detection of 10 new cases of coronavirus and two more deaths, appearing to bring the number of infections to 29 and the number of deaths to six. Japan, which confirmed 14 new cases on Saturday, faces growing questions about whether it is doing enough to contain its outbreak and whether the virus could disrupt this year’s Tokyo Olympics. Organizers postponed the start of training for volunteers as a precaution. The potential economic impact of the outbreak, which has caused massive disruption to businesses in China, overshadowed a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Saudi Arabia. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, presenting the fund’s outlook to central bankers and finance ministers in Riyadh, said the virus would likely lower China’s economic growth this year to 5.6%, down 0.4 percentage points from its January outlook, and shave 0.1 percentage points from global growth. Asian policymakers sought to soothe investors’ fears over the outbreak, which has roiled global markets, with equities sliding on Friday. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the yen’s recent declines were largely driven by a strong dollar, shrugging off some market views that the virus epidemic is triggering an outflow of funds from Asia. Senior Chinese central bank officials, meanwhile, played down worries about the potential damage to the world’s second-largest economy, saying the country’s financial system and currency were resilient. Chen Yulu, a deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China, said policymakers had plenty of tools to support the economy, and were confident of winning the war against the epidemic. “We believe that after this epidemic is over, pent-up demand for consumption and investment will be fully released, and China’s economy will rebound swiftly,” Chen told state TV.

No global digital tax by end-2020 would mean chaos: France,Feb 23 2020,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Failure to reach a global deal on where and how much to tax digital giants such as Google (), Amazon () or Facebook () would result in many digital tax regimes emerging all over the world, France’s Finance Minister said on Sunday. It would also likely trigger U.S. retaliatory tariffs, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters, underscoring Washington’s determination to thwart tax rules planned by France and other countries if no global deal is reached. Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of a meeting of world financial leaders, Bruno Le Maire said the gathering had been very useful in establishing consensus on such global tax rules. Finance ministers and central bankers from the world’s 20 biggest economies, the G20, met in Riyadh for talks on economic issues, with digital taxation topping their two-day agenda. Mnuchin said the issue was being addressed in negotiations with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and he hoped it could be resolved by the end of the year. But he said Washington would strike back at the digital taxes passed by France and others if those efforts failed. “We’ve been very consistent in saying we think the digital services tax is discriminatory in nature against digital companies, and specifically a handful of U.S. companies,” he said. “The president was clear that we were proceeding with ... reciprocal tariffs.” France and the United States have declared a truce to allow the multilateral talks to reach a conclusion by year-end. “For the first tine there is wide consensus among the G20 members on the necessity of having a new international taxation system,” Le Maire said. “We have to address the issue of digital companies making profits in many countries without any physical presence, which means without paying the due level of taxes,” he said. “And we also have to address the key question of minimum taxation and the risk of having a race to the bottom on taxation,” he said. The OECD wants to agree on technical details of such a tax by July. “There is a consensus to build a solution by the end of 2020,” Le Maire said, noting the alternative - no agreement - would create a proliferation of different tax systems making life more difficult for companies. “Lets be clear - either we have at the end of 2020 an international solution... clearly in the interest of all countries and digital companies, or there is no solution and ... then it will be up the national taxes to enter into force,” Le Maire said. “Instead of having one single, simple solution, we would have many different digital taxes, all over the world.” The United States, home to most of the digital giants, has been wary of committing to a solution on taxing them before a presidential election later this year.

UPDATE 1-Oman's new ruler aims to reduce country's debt,Feb 23 2020,"(Adds details and background) DUBAI, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Oman’s Sultan Haitham bin Tariq al-Said said on Sunday the government would work to reduce public debt and restructure public institutions and companies to bolster the economy. Haitham, in his second public speech since assuming power in January, said the government would create a national framework to tackle unemployment while addressing strained public finances. “We will direct our financial resources in the best way that will guarantee reducing debt and increasing revenues,” he said in the televised speech. “We will also direct all government departments to adopt efficient governance that leads to a balanced, diversified and sustainable economy.” Rated junk by all three major credit rating agencies, Oman’s debt to GDP ratio spiked to nearly 60% last year from around 15% in 2015, and could reach 70% by 2022, according to S&P Global Ratings. The small oil producing country has relied heavily on debt to offset a widening deficit caused by lower crude prices. Also, the late Sultan Qaboos, who ruled Oman for nearly 50 years, held back on austerity measures that could cause unrest. The country has delayed introducing a 5% value added tax from 2019 to 2021, and economic diversification has been slow, with oil and gas accounting for over 70% of government revenues. Last week, rating agency Fitch said Oman was budgeting for a higher deficit of 8.7% for 2020 despite its expectation of further asset-sale proceeds and some spending cuts. “We are willing to take the necessary measures to restructure the state’s administrative system and its legislation,” Haitham said in his first speech since the mourning period for Qaboos ended, without elaborating. He said there would be a full review of government companies to improve their business performance and competence. ","{'neg': 0.106, 'neu': 0.826, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': -0.9022}",-0.9022

Primark owner warns coronavirus threatens clothing supplies,Feb 24 2020,"LONDON (Reuters) - Primark owner Associated British Foods () warned on Monday there was a risk of shortages of some clothing lines later this year if delays in factory production in China are prolonged because of the coronavirus. The virus has killed 2,442 and infected 76,936 people in China, and slowed growth in the world’s second largest economy. AB Foods, which sources more than 40% of Primark’s product from China, said it typically builds inventories in advance of Chinese New Year, meaning it is well stocked for several months and does not expect any short-term impact. The group, which maintained its overall financial guidance for the full 2019-20 year, said it was working closely with its suppliers in China to assess the impact of the virus on their factories and supply chains and their ability to fulfill its current orders. “If delays to factory production are prolonged, the risk of supply shortages on some lines later this financial year increases,” it said. “We are assessing mitigating strategies, including a step up in production from existing suppliers in other regions.” Shares in AB Foods, the majority of which are owned by the family of CEO George Weston, were down 2% at 0906 GMT, paring gains over the last year to 9.5%. Shares in British clothing rivals Next () and Marks & Spencer () were down 2.5% and 3.8% respectively. Finance director John Bason said Primark was talking to suppliers in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Vietnam, Turkey and eastern Europe to fill the potential gap, although he said some items manufactured in China could not be replicated. “There are in accessories or whatever, areas like that, that China is very good at that are harder to source from elsewhere...So I’m not guaranteeing that we can replace all of the shortfall from China,” he told Reuters. AB Foods also owns major sugar, grocery, ingredients and agriculture arms. Several of its food businesses have operations in China. It said the China sugar processing campaign was completed in January before the coronavirus outbreak developed significantly. However, its AB Mauri, AB Agri and Ovaltine factories are operating at reduced capacity because of labor and logistics constraints caused by the virus outbreak. Bason said the impact was not material to the overall group. For its first half to Feb. 29, AB Foods forecast sales and operating profit ahead of the previous year. Primark’s first-half sales were forecast to be up 4.2%, with like-for-like sales level. British sales were forecast up 3.0%, with sales in the eurozone expected to be up 5.3%. The group’s outlook for the full-year was unchanged, with progress expected, on both a reported and a lease-adjusted basis, in adjusted earnings per share (EPS). Prior to Monday’s update analysts were on average forecasting a full-year EPS of 147.2 pence, according to Refinitiv data, up from 137.5 pence made in 2018-19.

FACTBOX-Remaining hurdles for scandal-hit Wells Fargo,Feb 22 2020,"Feb 21(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co has racked up well over $7 billion in penalties since a sales practices scandal erupted in 2016, and continues to face headwinds. Here are some of the remaining shoes that have yet to drop: More hearings: The House Financial Services Committee said on Friday that it will conduct three Wells Fargo hearings next month where new Chief Executive Charles Scharf and other company officials will be probed about the scandal. The bank’s executives have in the past been called to testify before Congress about the bank’s wrongdoings and explain how the bank has changed. Scharf has tried to place the scandal squarely in the past, describing “historical” and “legacy” issues, but lawmakers will rehash Wells Fargo’s mistakes in public. Consent orders: Wells Fargo is currently operating under roughly 14 consent orders with various regulators including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Under the orders, the bank will endure intense regulatory scrutiny until it proves it has fixed procedures that allowed employees to create potentially millions of unauthorized accounts, and sell auto insurance and other add-on products that customers did not want or need. The orders also require Wells Fargo to repay customers for costs associated with its consumer abuses. So far the bank has paid out at least tens of millions of dollars in remediation. Asset cap: The most notable consent order looming over the bank is the U.S. Federal Reserve’s asset cap, which put an unprecedented growth restriction on the bank’s balance sheet until it proves that it has overhauled its risk management and controls.  Since the asset cap was announced in early 2018, bank executives repeatedly extended the timeline for getting it removed and have since stopped giving any guidance on the issue. On his first public conference call last month, Scharf did not set a new timeline. ","{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.807, 'pos': 0.119, 'compound': 0.9321}",0.9321

"UPDATE 2-Saudi economy set to grow this year, driven by non-oil sector - central bank",Feb 22 2020,"(Adds details) By Marwa Rashad and Davide Barbuscia RIYADH, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s economy is expected to grow this year, supported by the non-oil sector, despite a challenging global economic backdrop, the Saudi central bank governor said on Saturday as the kingdom hosts the G20 meeting. Ahmed al-Kholifey said it was too early to see the full picture of the economic damage caused by the new coronavirus, which has emerged in China and spread globally. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority governor was speaking at an economic conference in Riyadh, where finance leaders of the world’s 20 largest economies have gathered this weekend to discuss policies and the impact of the virus on global growth. “GDP growth in Saudi Arabia is projected to see an upturn in 2020,” said Kholifey. “Monetary, fiscal and structural policies in my country are all geared towards an expansion of the private non-oil sector GDP over the medium term,” he said. The International Monetary Fund said in January it expects the Saudi economy to expand 1.9% this year, up from an estimated 0.4% in 2019. However it lowered its forecast for the kingdom’s 2020 growth from 2.2% due to lower oil output. “We have a positive view on the Saudi economy, the forecasts are positive and growth is expected to be higher than last year, especially from the private sector,” Kholifey said. After a bad year for the global economy last year, with the weakest global GDP growth since the financial crisis, Kholifey said Saudi Arabia was looking for “good news” this weekend. “At our upcoming G20 meeting, we will be looking for good news from other countries as well, which overall will hopefully confirm the baseline projection that the growth slowdown has bottomed out and a turnaround in output growth in the current year can be expected, albeit a moderate one,” he added. But he cautioned that trade tensions, geopolitical risks, and the outbreak of the new coronavirus were downside risks to global growth. The comments came after the Institute of International Finance warned on Friday that the virus outbreak may curb demand for oil in China and other Asian countries, depressing crude prices further, to as low as $57 a barrel, and clouding growth prospects across the Middle East.

Saudi-led coalition says it foiled Red Sea attack by Yemen's Houthis,Feb 23 2020,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Naval forces from the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen on Sunday foiled an “imminent terrorist” attack by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in the southern Red Sea, a major commercial shipping channel, the coalition said. The forces destroyed an unmanned boat laden with explosives that was launched from Hodeidah province in western Yemen, coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said in a statement on Saudi state news agency SPA, without identifying the targets. There was no immediate confirmation from the Houthi movement, which has been battling the Sunni Muslim military coalition since 2015 in a conflict that is largely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and foe Shi’ite Iran. Yemen lies along the Bab al-Mandeb strait at the southern mouth of the Red Sea, one of the most important trade routes for oil tankers heading from the Middle East to Europe. Malki said the planned attack posed a threat to regional and international security and maritime trade. He said the use of Hodeidah for operations was a “glaring violation” of a U.N.-led peace deal in the disputed port city that was agreed between the Saudi-backed Yemeni government and the Houthis in December 2018. Violence rose in January, ending more than three months of unprecedented calm in the five-year-old conflict following informal ceasefire talks between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis. Coalition warplanes carried out several air strikes on the Houthi-held capital Sanaa on Sunday, hitting the presidential palace and other military sites, residents told Reuters. Malki said later that the operation on Sanaa had destroyed Houthi sites used to store ballistic missiles and drones. The strikes were the first to hit the capital for several months, residents said, and followed attempted missile attacks by Houthi forces on Saudi cities on Friday, as the kingdom prepared for a gathering of finance ministers from the Group of 20 major economies in Riyadh. The Western-backed coalition intervened in Yemen to try to restore the internationally recognized government that was ousted from power in Sanaa in late 2014 by the Houthis, who now control most major urban centers.

Shifting sands of inflation unsettle top bankers at Riyadh G20 meeting,Feb 23 2020,"RIYADH/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Central bankers from the United States, Japan and the euro zone meeting in the desert kingdom of Saudi Arabia this weekend had their own shifting sands to cross – those of elusive inflation. The problem facing all three is that price growth has long stopped behaving as expected, as aging populations and technological advances prevent inflation from meeting their cherished 2% target despite aggressive stimulus measures. This is leading to a deep rethink by the world’s most powerful central banks, starting from how they define their goal and what tools they use to achieve it - a process that was becoming even more urgent as the world braced for the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak. The meeting of finance leaders from the world’s 20 top economies in Riyadh provided a chance for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, ECB President Christine Lagarde and Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda to compare notes. Lagarde was due to meet Powell later on Sunday, having had a brief exchange with Kuroda the previous day. “The major central banks all face similar problems, including how to deal with another economic downturn,” said an executive of one of the banks present at the G20 meeting. “They’ve been discussing this topic for a while. It’s about time they come up with some form of conclusion,” he said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Kuroda has plenty of lessons to offer on the dangers of keeping subdued price growth unattended for too long. He deployed a heavy dose of stimulus in 2013, only to see inflation stagnate at levels well below its 2% target. Mindful of such dangers, the Fed is in the midst of its framework review that focuses on how it should pursue 2% inflation using tools such as forward guidance. In its own review, the ECB is all but certain to overhaul its inflation goal, defined as a rate of price growth “below but close to 2%,” to signal it does not see that level as a ceiling. Inflation can be economically and politically destructive if prices rise too fast but a moderate pace, such as 2%, is seen as needed to enable companies to raise wages and create a virtuous cycle for the economy. Critics doubt whether tweaks to the definition of price goals would be effective in battling headwinds from demographics and technological innovation. Older populations tend to consume less while new technologies foster greater efficiency at a lower cost. Together they can be powerful forces leaning against inflation. To tackle this, the Fed has looked into ideas such as a “make up strategy,” under which a central bank promises to allow inflation to run above target to make up for times of weakness in the economy. But that would tie the hands of future policymakers - a risky strategy. “It works beautifully in models,” Thomas Barkin, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. “It makes me nervous in practice.” Many BOJ officials, too, are wary of doing another framework review and doubt any tweak to the inflation target will help people believe more strongly that prices will rise. “There are doubts within the BOJ on whether pledging to achieve higher inflation could change public perceptions dramatically, especially if inflation is still distant from the current target,” said a source familiar with its thinking. With no clear breakthrough on other tools central banks have at their disposal, managing public expectations is now among their strongest weapons. And yet the rising cost of prolonged low interest rates, from soaring property prices to vanishing returns for pension funds, means central banks cannot just stand by hoping inflation will perk up some day. “The side effects are more acute now and I think we should tone down our communication that benefits far outweigh the costs,” an ECB policymaker said on condition of anonymity. Rejecting the idea that interest rates could stay low forever, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva likened policymakers’ complacency to a frog who doesn’t realize it is swimming in gradually heating water until it is too late. “This is the risk that we are facing,” she told a conference this week held on the sidelines of the G20 meeting. “That an incremental pileup of debt in a low interest environment doesn’t give us a good signal to ... jump out of the boiling water.”  ","{'neg': 0.081, 'neu': 0.799, 'pos': 0.12, 'compound': 0.9839}",0.9839

Sterling drops as spreading coronavirus sends investors into dollars,Feb 24 2020,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2020  * Graphic: Trade-weighted sterling since Brexit vote  LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Sterling fell on Monday as rising fears about the economic impact from the spreading coronavirus encouraged investors to seek safety in the U.S. dollar.

The pound has been supported in recent weeks by better-than-expected economic data and growing expectations that the new UK finance minister will announce more spending at next month’s budget. But those gains have been capped because of broad dollar strength and ongoing worries about Britain’s trade negotiations with the European Union. “A quiet week in terms of data releases is going to leave space to the other two key drivers of GBP: UK-EU trade negotiations and hints about the content of the upcoming UK budget,” ING analysts said in a research note.

The ECB wants to talk to you about inflation. But will it listen?,Feb 23 2020,"FRANKFURT/RIYADH (Reuters) - For many people, the language of European Central Bank policymakers is so impenetrable, it could be beamed from another planet.  Now, however, the ECB experts are in for a dose of real life as they meet audiences ranging from students to clergy this year to get their views on inflation and feedback on the central bank’s work, six officials told Reuters. The series of events, called “ECB Listens” after a similar initiative by the Federal Reserve, illustrates a marked change in style under new President Christine Lagarde, a former politician with a penchant for public relations. Just last October her predecessor, then President Mario Draghi, had expressed his reservations about communicating with the public at large rather than finance aficionados. “One has to be cautious about that because as soon as you change your audience, you change your language and you naturally step into a different realm: the realm of politics,” he said. The change of tack could also be an indication of the quandary the euro zone’s central bank finds itself over the adequacy of the inflation data used to justify trillions of euros worth of monetary stimulus to support Europe’s economy. Surveys show households in the euro zone perceive inflation to be far higher than official data. Some ECB policymakers suspect this is because the data does not factor in changes in the price of homes occupied by their owners - a key measure of financial health for millions of people. An ECB spokesman declined to comment.    The ECB will kick off proceedings, part of a year-long strategic review, with an event in Brussels on March 26, according to the sources who are on or close to the ECB’s Governing Council. Each of the euro zone’s 19 national central banks has been asked to hold at least one such meeting by the summer, they said. The ECB is unlikely to make any communication about the outcome of its review, which could see it redefine its inflation target, until well after the end of the public consultations, the officials added.  This would dash the hopes of some policymakers, including Slovak central bank governor Peter Kazimir, who have said they would like to see the ECB’s revised inflation target published early, in time for its annual forum in Sintra, Portugal starting on June 29. “It would look pretty awful if we put out substantial communication on the review in June because that would mean we are not taking the feedback seriously,” said one of the sources, who all spoke on condition of anonymity because the ECB’s deliberations are private. The public meetings will see small entrepreneurs, academics, students, pensioners and even priests invited to give ECB policymakers a piece of their mind on inflation as well as other topics ranging from climate change to digital currencies. However, the public meetings may draw accusations from some quarters of simply being a public-relations exercise. The sources themselves were unanimous in believing input from the public was unlikely to sway deliberations on how to reset the ECB’s definition of price stability, currently worded as an inflation rate “below, but close to 2%”. Rather, policymakers are keen to understand why perceptions of inflation are so high and why salary growth is comparatively sluggish. They will also try to explain the ECB’s activities in simpler language, in line with the personal style of Lagarde, a former French finance minister and head of the International Monetary Fund.  “There is a covert goal of spreading the ECB’s message to the people,” one of the sources said. “It’s an experiment in a new communication approach.”     ","{'neg': 0.017, 'neu': 0.95, 'pos': 0.034, 'compound': 0.802}",0.802
"Togo president declares landslide election win, opponent slams 'masquerade'",Feb 24 2020,"LOME (Reuters) - Togo President Faure Gnassingbe declared an electoral victory on Monday as official preliminary results showed him re-elected in a landslide, though an opposition candidate also claimed victory and called Monday’s result a “masquerade”.  Glassingbe’s win, if confirmed, will give him a fourth five-year term and extend a family dynasty that began when his father took power in a 1967 coup. But some Togolese worry that a contested outcome could lead to political violence.  Preliminary figures released by the electoral commission showed Gnassingbe winning with 72 percent of the vote, with his main opponent, former prime minister Gabriel Messan Agbeyome Kodjo, at 18%. Longtime opposition leader Jean-Pierre Fabre received just 4%. Final results are expected in the coming days.  “To my unlucky adversaries, I would like to tell them, this is the game of democracy,” Gnassingbe told supporters in the early hours of Monday. “Let’s stop improvising, stop inventing imaginary numbers and submit to the judgment of the Togolese people.” Kodjo repeated the claim that his camp’s tallies showed him winning the election. He had said before the results were announced that he had won around 60 percent of the vote.  “We’re calling on the Togolese people to mobilize to show its disapproval of this election masquerade,” he told reporters. Under the law, Kodjo has 72 hours after the results were announced to officially contest the results with the Supreme Court. It was not clear if he planned to do so.  Togo has seen protests in the past by demonstrators who say the president has illegally outstayed his welcome. When Gnassingbe came to power in 2005 after his father’s death, mass protests against the family’s rule were met with a violent police crackdown during which at least 500 people were killed. The streets of the ocean-side capital Lome were calm on Monday. Schools reopened and students were in class. Still, many citizens doubted the results. Afi Amedzro, a 38-year-old woman working in micro-finance, blamed Gnassingbe’s party for cheating. “They are still arrogant vote thieves,” she said. “What we saw on Saturday at polling stations is more than enough to give victory to Agbeyome Kodjo.” Another five-year term for Gnassingbe would be a blow to Togo’s fractured opposition, which is desperate for change but has been unable to launch a concerted political campaign against the president.   Togo is the 10th poorest country in the world, according to the International Monetary Fund. ","{'neg': 0.085, 'neu': 0.862, 'pos': 0.052, 'compound': -0.8943}",-0.8943

UPDATE 1-U.S. blocking G20 mention of climate change in draft communique - sources,Feb 23 2020,"(Adds quotes, details) RIYADH, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The United States is against mentioning climate change in the communique of the world’s financial leaders, G20 diplomats said, after a new draft of the joint statement showed the G20 are considering including it as a risk factor to growth. Finance ministers and central bankers of the world’s 20 biggest economies (G20) are discussing top global economic challenges on Saturday and Sunday in Riyadh, focusing on the growth outlook and new rules to tax global digital companies. The G20 expects a modest pick-up in global growth this year and next, but noted downside risks to this outlook stemming from “... geopolitical and remaining trade tensions and policy uncertainty and macroeconomic risk related to environmental sustainability”. The latest draft communique gives less prominence to the outbreak of the coronavirus as a growth risk, saying only the G20 would ...” enhance global risk monitoring, including the recent outbreak of COVID-19,” the medical acronym for the coronavirus. G20 sources said the United States was refusing to accept language on climate change as a risk to the economy, and other delegates might ultimately have to revert to an earlier draft that did not include the climate language. Discussions about the communique are due to resume early Sunday. “Usually China blocks as well, but as they are represented at lower level it’s mainly the U.S.,” one G20 diplomat said. “Climate is the last sticking point in the communique. There is still no agreement,” a second source familiar with the negotiations said. Stephanie Segal, a former senior U.S. Treasury official and fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said there was another alternative to striking the climate change language - an agreement by all other nations. “There’s  precedent for the 19 + 1 configuration, sad as that is, from Germany’s G20 presidency,” she said, referring to the July 2017 G20 summit when all leaders backed a single communique with pledges on trade, finance, energy and Africa, but Washington refused to back language on climate change. “It would be a shame if the Saudis/others agreed to strike the language rather than fall back to 19 + 1,” Segal said.

UK employers urge Johnson not to sacrifice services in EU deal,Feb 24 2020,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain must not exclude its huge services industry from a planned trade deal with the European Union as the price for reclaiming control over its economy, a group representing British employers said on Monday. The Confederation of British Industry urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson to secure a post-Brexit deal that will not leave out service industries, such as finance, something many employers fear if London and Brussels stick to their guns. Avoiding costly red tape and customs complexities were also vital for goods companies, the CBI said. Britain and the EU are expected to begin talks for a trade deal next month, leaving little time before a post-Brexit standstill period expires on Dec. 31. Most economists polled by Reuters this month thought the most likely outcome would be a goods-only deal. Relations between Johnson and some business groups have been strained by his dismissal of their concerns about Britain’s exit from the EU. Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI’s director-general, said British companies backed many of the government’s objectives for the  negotiations, such as securing zero trade tariffs and allowing free flows of data. “In other areas, how the government strikes the balance between access and control is less clear,” she said. “All efforts must be made in these talks to save exporters time and money, avoiding new paperwork, costs and delays.” The CBI said it accepted that its once favored scenario of Britain remaining in the EU’s customs union was now dead, posing challenges for the world’s fifth-biggest economy. London and Brussels are far apart on key issues, chief among them Britain’s insistence that it must be free to set its own rules for business while the EU wants a so-called level playing field on issues such as the environment and state aid. The CBI said it agreed with the government that Britain had to be able to seize new opportunities by setting regulations for emerging technologies in areas such as artificial intelligence, digital payments and quantum computing. “But for the UK to truly be spear-heading this new frontier, its world-leading industries must not be distracted by significant new burdens on their exports,” it said.

"US Treasury Secretary says ""safe harbor"" proposal is not an optional tax",Feb 22 2020,"RIYADH, Feb 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday his “safe harbor” proposal for U.S. companies was not an optional tax and he hopes the OECD will agree on a global tax reform this year. “Our proposal has been referred to as an optional tax. It’s not an optional tax... it’s a safe harbor,” Mnuchin told an economic conference in Saudi Arabia, which is hosting finance leaders of the world’s 20 largest economies. “People will pay a price for certainty. I think that’s something there’s a lot of support for. I think this is hopefully something we can get done this year.” In December Mnuchin raised serious questions about OECD international tax reform proposals in a letter made public, jarring international officials by floating the idea of a safe harbor regime.

World's financial firms risk $1 trillion in losses if slow to act on climate change: report,Feb 22 2020,"LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s financial services sector risks losses of up to $1 trillion if it fails to respond quickly to climate change and is hit by policy shifts such as the introduction of a carbon tax, a new report shows. The report by consultants Oliver Wyman, published on Friday, comes as pressure on the industry to accelerate efforts to help better allocate capital in the shift to a low-carbon economy ratchets up ahead of United Nations climate talks in November in Glasgow, Scotland. Finance firms need to calculate and reduce their exposure to dirty industries such as oil and gas, the report said.  Amid concerns about the amount of potential climate-linked credit risk on lenders’ balance sheets, banks in countries like Britain and France will also soon face climate stress tests on top of existing financial ones. The Oliver Wyman analysis found that if carbon taxes were imposed at a level of $50 per tonne of carbon dioxide in two of the most polluting industries - power generation and oil and gas - this would result in estimated credit losses of between $50 billion to $300 billion in both sectors. The probability of credit defaults in the sectors increased by two or three times for the firms most impacted, the report found. By extrapolating across all industries, the New York-based consultancy said losses could reach $1 trillion. The risk to firms of such a tax being imposed is real, with half of all signatories to the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate saying they were actively considering a carbon tax, the World Bank has said. “Our analysis shows that there are strong commercial reasons to act – the financial risks are material and need to be incorporated into decision-making,” James Davis, a partner at Oliver Wyman said. “This is an opportunity for the industry to lead.” Banks are bracing for a likely combative round of annual meetings with investors regarding their sustainability credentials, while protest group Extinction Rebellion plans a fresh wave of action against the sector. Oliver Wyman found that few firms in the financial services industry - including insurers and asset managers - were modeling climate risks at a granular level. It also estimated that the market for sustainable finance has more than 100-150 billion pounds of revenue potential across investing, financing, data and advisory over the next 5-10 years.

'We want to listen': Lagarde kicks off ECB roadshow,Feb 24 2020,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank said on Monday it was launching a roadshow to collect feedback from citizens across the euro zone, part of efforts by its new chief Christine Lagarde to engage the public as the ECB undertakes a wide-ranging policy review.  Lagarde will herself will kick off the town-hall events — dubbed the “ECB Listens” after a similarly branded event run by the U.S. Federal Reserve last year — in Brussels on March 26. Each of the euro zone’s 19 national central banks has been told to hold at least one such meeting, which will mostly take place in the first half of the year. “We want to listen to the views, expectations and concerns of the public with an open mind,” Lagarde said in a statement. The initiative illustrates a marked change in style for the ECB under Lagarde, a former politician with a penchant for public relations who took over from Mario Draghi as president of the euro zone central bank in November. It is also an indication of the quandary the ECB finds itself in over the adequacy of the inflation data it has used to justify trillions of euros worth of monetary stimulus to support Europe’s economy.

Hong Kong companies have no safety net in fight for survival amid coronovirus crisis,Feb 24 2020,"HONG KONG (BLOOMBERG) - Hong Kong is being threatened by a ""Tsunami-like"" cataclysm, the city's finance chief has warned, as the   devastates businesses already hobbled by months of anti-government protests. The financial hub's lack of a bankruptcy process will only exacerbate the pain. Unlike in the US, Australia and rival Singapore, businesses in Hong Kong don't have recourse to any corporate rescue procedure when in difficulties. The lack of a proper legal framework for seeking bankruptcy protection, which has been deliberated on for a quarter century, means companies are forced into liquidation, according to Johnson Kong, the president of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants. ""If we had the laws in place earlier, companies could have a better chance to survive this hit,"" Kong said in an interview last week. Formal procedures give cash-strapped companies the opportunity to turn around, instead of immediately winding up and leaving employees and creditors unpaid. In the US, for example, Chapter 11 protection helped the once troubled toy chain Toys 'R' Us come back. Kong expects a wave of failures with the virus outbreak keeping consumers indoors. Last year's list of casualties was already the highest in two years as Chinese tourists deserted the protest-hit city and pushed it into recession. The government has pledged HK$25 billion (S$4.5 billion) for relief measures and banks have been waiving some fees and extending loan payments. The retail and food and beverage sectors are most vulnerable to liquidations, said Kong, who's been involved in restructuring and insolvencies for more than 35 years. Hong Kong has been discussing a new legal framework since as early as 1996 and proposed legislation was submitted in 2014, but never dealt with by lawmakers. Stay in the know with e-mail alerts By signing up, you agree to our   and  A spokesman for the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau said that a new bill is now in an ""advance stage,"" but any debate on it won't happen until later this year, or early next year. ""Given the complexity and technicalities of the bill as well as the concerns expressed by various stakeholders in previous exercises, we will organize a fresh round of engagement with stakeholders on specific areas in the draft bill in the next few months,"" the spokesman said. Kong, who was on the Standing Committee on Company Law Reform from 2009 to 2015, said that the government pushed for a rescue procedure after Lehman Brothers collapsed, but the economy recovered swiftly and the plan was ""put on the back burner."" January was the worst start to a year since 2015 with 703 failures, according to the latest statistics from the Hong Kong government. The city's unemployment rate also rose for a fourth straight month, reaching its highest level since 2016. The data does not reflect the full impact of shutdowns from the outbreak, which emerged toward the end of January. Kong said that the pain for many Hong Kongers facing unemployment will also be worsened by a failure to adjust jobless benefits for inflation. These benefits, paid out by the Hong Kong Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund, are still based on the median wage back in 1995, which is about half the current level. Gordon Lam, a food truck owner and convener for the Hong Kong Small and Middle Restaurant Federation, said a lot of his peers are considering closing up. The virus has brought business to a standstill, while rents and staff expenses remain. “Doing business in Hong Kong has always been pricey, but I could at least make the money to pay rent and costs,” he said. “Now there’s no business to start with.” Read in-depth reports and explainers on the global health crisis and its impact on Singapore, China, and countries around the world.
